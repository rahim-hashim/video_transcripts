# Klay’s Gone, CP3 & Wemby, and More NBA Free Agency Reactions | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U)
*  I was going to play two word NBA with you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=0.0s)]
*  New gimmick. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2.58s)]
*  Feel free to steal this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=3.18s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=4.5s)]
*  Two word NBA, two word NBA. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=4.8s)]
*  My two words for clay Thompson salary envy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=8.14s)]
*  They made the classic mistake. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=12.8s)]
*  Jordan pool. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=15.9s)]
*  Here's your extension. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=16.82s)]
*  Dream on dream on here's your extension. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=19.8s)]
*  Clay, what we'll talk after he's just immediately offended. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=24.98s)]
*  It's like, really? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  We won four titles together. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=29.459999999999997s)]
*  Where's my extension? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=30.68s)]
*  What about me? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=31.68s)]
*  I mean, that's basically what started the pool dream on thing in the first place. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=32.98s)]
*  So I think once that started, uh, you get into the, uh, the why them, not me. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=36.28s)]
*  And, and you're down when you've won titles with a guy and you're not taking [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=43.58s)]
*  care of them, like you're taking care of some of the other people it's, it's, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=47.78s)]
*  it's hard to come back from. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=52.92s)]
*  So then what are the warriors doing? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  You're letting, you're letting clay go. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=55.66s)]
*  You're letting Chris Paul go. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=57.5s)]
*  You're competing for a championship. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  You're making some huge move. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=61.38s)]
*  That's my next two word NBA. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=64.38s)]
*  Coughlin's law. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=67.62s)]
*  Everything ends badly. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=71.78s)]
*  Otherwise it doesn't end. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=72.98s)]
*  What does it say? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=74.22s)]
*  It's supposed to end. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=75.06s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=76.9s)]
*  If we did conciliatory for the warriors, what would we tell them? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  Blow it up. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=81.92s)]
*  It's over. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=83.02000000000001s)]
*  You're not winning the title. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=85.06s)]
*  It's done. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=86.02000000000001s)]
*  You won four. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=87.14s)]
*  You, it was a miracle. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=88.1s)]
*  You got 2022 it's over. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  Start thinking about how you can build around Curry for the next part of the decade. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=92.42s)]
*  This is a gap year. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=96.46s)]
*  Throw it away. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=97.34s)]
*  That's what I would say. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=98.62s)]
*  I mean, you're probably right. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=99.94s)]
*  It's just such a bummer. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=101.38s)]
*  I just, I don't know. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=102.46s)]
*  I, I felt like, yeah, I'm just kind of bummed out about this one. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=103.1s)]
*  Just bummed out about, I don't know why it just feels like I'm just like a little [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=109.06s)]
*  bit upset of like, this is the team that has defined a generation. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=113.25999999999999s)]
*  Now it's just ending with a bit of a whimper. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=117.3s)]
*  Now we have the Celtics. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  It's been done, I guess. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=120.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=121.97999999999999s)]
*  Here's how I'd put it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=126.25999999999999s)]
*  First of all, they won four titles, which is amazing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=128.18s)]
*  Um, if they made the Paul George trade rumor, and I don't know what was in it, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=131.38s)]
*  but I assume Kamingo was in it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=137.1s)]
*  I assume Chris Paul's contract was in it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=138.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=140.82s)]
*  Probably a pick some other stuff. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=141.34s)]
*  And the Quippers just didn't want to take all that additional stuff. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=143.01999999999998s)]
*  And it fell through, but if they had made the Paul George trade, I was trying to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=146.1s)]
*  figure out where I would have put them in the pecking order for who wins the title. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=153.9s)]
*  So you got the top five to me is almost unassailable. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=154.34s)]
*  That's a top six, Boston, OKC, Denver, Minnesota, New York, and Dallas, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=159.06s)]
*  I think are the top six. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=163.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=165.74s)]
*  And Milwaukee is like seven with a chance to jump. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=165.98s)]
*  You had OKC in there? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=170.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  Boston, OKC, Denver, Minnesota, New York, Dallas, as your six. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=172.34s)]
*  And Milwaukee is like right there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=178.18s)]
*  They're in the, they're in the lobby. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=180.54s)]
*  They're like reading a sports illustrated for kids from nine months ago, kind of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=182.26s)]
*  waiting to get called into an office, but they're still in the lobby. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=186.38s)]
*  And then the next three would have been Indiana, Cleveland, Philly. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=190.82s)]
*  Now Philly's getting Paul George. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=194.5s)]
*  So maybe Philly's eight, but I think, I think Golden state with Paul [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=195.82s)]
*  George would have been in that mix. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=198.94s)]
*  Now I'm looking at them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=202.38s)]
*  I have them 19th. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=203.66s)]
*  19th. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=206.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=207.3s)]
*  I have them after Memphis. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=208.46s)]
*  I have them after Houston. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=211.02s)]
*  I have them after Sacramento. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=212.9s)]
*  I think, I think Houston and I'm sorry, I think Memphis and the Lakers are tied [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=215.42s)]
*  at 13th because we did a story on it last week or tied at 13th. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=220.5s)]
*  Oh, that's funny. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=224.66s)]
*  I had the Lakers at 14th. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=225.18s)]
*  So I had Orlando 10. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=226.38s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=227.86s)]
*  Orlando 11, Phoenix 12, New Orleans 13 Lakers 14, Miami 15. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=228.22s)]
*  And the Golden stage is not better than any of those things. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=233.82s)]
*  Memphis, Houston, Sacramento, Golden state. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=236.06s)]
*  And I think they're right there with the Clippers for that 19th spot. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=238.7s)]
*  And I would give it to Golden state, but they're closer to the bottom than the top. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=242.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  And I don't just don't know. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  Like if I was a minority owner of the team and Lake I was like, Hey guys, do [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=248.7s)]
*  you want to pay the luxury tax? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=251.78s)]
*  I'd be like, no. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=252.98s)]
*  So what are you doing? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=255.62s)]
*  You're trying to buy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=256.38s)]
*  This is a gap year to try to free up money and get somebody else to play with Steph. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=257.06s)]
*  Well, that's my next tour. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=263.02s)]
*  My next tour at NBA and their answer trade Draymond. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=264.7s)]
*  That's it's right now is the time. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=267.86s)]
*  Got to do it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=270.02s)]
*  You got to get a rip the bandaid off and just do it and talk Steph into it and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=271.26s)]
*  explain to him, like, we're going to not be good for one year and we'll make it [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=275.94s)]
*  up to you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=279.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=280.78s)]
*  We're we've already done that a few times. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=281.02s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=283.78s)]
*  I'm done with that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=284.06s)]
*  I've died. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=285.5s)]
*  I'm at how come this is what I would say. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=287.06s)]
*  How come LeBron gets to compete for a championship every year? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=290.14s)]
*  How? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=294.7s)]
*  Why can't I, why do I have to take these huge gap years? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=294.82s)]
*  You know, here's the answer because you never push us and prod us and work the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=299.38s)]
*  media to make it so that work under constant pressure to do stuff because [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=304.38s)]
*  you're Steph Curry. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=308.82s)]
*  You don't do that stuff. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=310.26s)]
*  So we're going to take advantage of you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=312.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=314.14s)]
*  I mean, that's not the answer I want to hear, but I appreciate your honesty. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=314.42s)]
*  Basically. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=318.98s)]
*  So what could they get for Draymond? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=320.58s)]
*  Like, could they talk to Lakers into Rui Hachimora in that hood, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=325.14s)]
*  Shafino and a 20, 29 first for Draymond? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=329.38s)]
*  I wouldn't do that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=333.38s)]
*  For who? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=334.74s)]
*  For Draymond. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=336.62s)]
*  I wouldn't do that at all. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=337.21999999999997s)]
*  But I'm saying this is all part of a bigger thing of. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=338.62s)]
*  We're not going to be good this year. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=343.06s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=344.34s)]
*  This is how it's going to go. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=344.78s)]
*  So let's, let's just not be good. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=346.46s)]
*  If Steph, if I was Steph and I didn't have enough, you know, my morning [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=349.34s)]
*  coffee, I'd be like, you know, while you're at it, why don't you, why don't [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=355.1s)]
*  you grab some offers for me too? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=357.98s)]
*  If you're blowing up the team and trading all my friends and the core of this [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=360.1s)]
*  team, I'm just trying to get to the playoffs and I think I, it's the same [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=363.78s)]
*  with LeBron, get me, I get a team good enough to get me to the playoffs and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=367.3s)]
*  let us do our thing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=371.58s)]
*  This team did not make the playoffs last year with, with Chris Paul and Clay Thompson. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=372.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, how'd we do the year before? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=377.82s)]
*  They lost in the playing game. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=381.02s)]
*  Two years ago, three years ago. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=383.7s)]
*  I don't know, but I guarantee you, these are the conversations they're having. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=386.94s)]
*  It's like, we're closer to 30 than we are to one. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=390.53999999999996s)]
*  It's the reality of the situation. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=393.65999999999997s)]
*  Then blow it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=395.65999999999997s)]
*  Then if you're going to blow it up, don't keep the best player. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=396.14s)]
*  I'd be mad if I was Steph. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=399.86s)]
*  What's the, I mean, what's the point of me playing out the string? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=401.42s)]
*  Like, like late, late, uh, Kobe era Lakers. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=406.58s)]
*  Like I'm kind of, I'm there. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=411.46s)]
*  I'm, I'm on kind of a, I'm just finishing my career here. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=414.42s)]
*  He got his 22 title and immortality. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=419.18s)]
*  So now it's a question of, it just, to me, seems like the era of titles [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=423.98s)]
*  and golden state is it's not over, but it's on a hard pause and it's going [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=430.22s)]
*  to be impossible with the team to have. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=434.66s)]
*  So when Draymond got thrown out, was it the magic game? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=436.58000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=440.46000000000004s)]
*  Is the magic. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=440.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=441.66s)]
*  When Draymond got thrown out and Steph put his Jersey over his face and it [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=442.42s)]
*  looked like he was crying. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=448.94000000000005s)]
*  Oh, why do you think he was crying? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=451.74s)]
*  Because I don't think he was crying. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=453.46000000000004s)]
*  I think he was so upset. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=455.38000000000005s)]
*  That is just like been the season, two seasons from hell, basically, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=457.5s)]
*  since they won the title. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=460.78000000000003s)]
*  I think he was probably just frustrated. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=461.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=464.3s)]
*  I don't think he would cry at anything. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=464.54s)]
*  And unless it was like the end of the sad movie where like, like that movie [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=466.18s)]
*  with Mark Wahlberg with the dog, King Richard, whatever it's called, did you [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=471.26s)]
*  see that? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=475.26s)]
*  It's a sad dog. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=475.82s)]
*  It gets emotional at the end. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=479.58s)]
*  I don't tell me. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=481.34000000000003s)]
*  Uh, so, so either way, he's very emotional. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=482.62s)]
*  About it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=486.54s)]
*  It's not actually ended up winning the game, but to me that showed like, I [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=487.22s)]
*  still want to win and I want to compete. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=492.22s)]
*  I'm not here to just, so how are you going to try? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=494.42s)]
*  How are you going to sell me on like, ah, we're going to rebuild. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=498.06s)]
*  Like how, like we're not sure. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=500.58000000000004s)]
*  We're going to trade your favorite player. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=501.86s)]
*  Look at their team compared to who they're competing against just in the West. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=504.1s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=507.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=508.34000000000003s)]
*  See if they get a Hartenstein combined with they got Caruso and SGA and [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=508.66s)]
*  Jalen Williams and chat. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=514.3s)]
*  Like they have no chance of getting that team. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=515.62s)]
*  Denver is Yoke-age who owns them. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=517.3s)]
*  Minnesota who was really good last year. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=519.4599999999999s)]
*  And then on top of it, just add a Rob Dillingham was going to be super fun. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=523.5799999999999s)]
*  Dallas who has the best part in the conference other than Yoke-age and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=526.8599999999999s)]
*  who's loading up as well. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=531.18s)]
*  Like they, they're not in the conversation anymore. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=532.42s)]
*  Like at some point, if you can't, we went through this with the Patriots, right? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=535.54s)]
*  That Brady's last year where it was just clear that it was over. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=541.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=545.5s)]
*  And it got super clumsy with how they handled it, but we all knew it was over. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=545.8599999999999s)]
*  Like when it's over, it's over. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=551.3399999999999s)]
*  I don't see any way back unless they reset. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=554.3399999999999s)]
*  Well then play it out. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=558.2199999999999s)]
*  The last year, I don't think they would trade Draymond, even if that's the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=560.62s)]
*  move because of the Curry piece. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=564.6999999999999s)]
*  I think that would be the one where it's like, all right, this is too far. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=566.26s)]
*  That's my guy. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=568.5799999999999s)]
*  You can't trade him. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=569.14s)]
*  Like I'm, I'm, I'm ready. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=569.86s)]
*  Like we run a thousand plays a game where we just know where each other are. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=571.2600000000001s)]
*  He gets me open. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=575.0600000000001s)]
*  It's fun playing basketball with him. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=576.38s)]
*  I'm not just here to, I'm not going to carry the team all by myself. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=578.7s)]
*  Does Draymond get more or less erratic as the months pass here? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=583.3000000000001s)]
*  Cause it's been, it was, been a pretty erratic 18 months stretch. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=588.62s)]
*  And I wonder like with age, does that get better or worse? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=593.98s)]
*  We've seen it go both ways. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=596.58s)]
*  We've seen guys get goofier. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=598.14s)]
*  We've also seen guys like kind of mature later in age and either way, he cannot [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=600.98s)]
*  have the year he just had. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=606.02s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=607.26s)]
*  I assume he's going to be locked in. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=608.06s)]
*  He wants to compete too. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=610.62s)]
*  I assume he's going to be locked in, but maybe he has to dial up a level of [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=611.86s)]
*  intensity because these games it's very, don't have as high enough stakes. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=615.02s)]
*  Here's my next two word. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=621.3s)]
*  Do you have any more warrior stuff? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=622.66s)]
*  No. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=624.66s)]
*  Are we done? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=626.5799999999999s)]
*  Chris Paul, we were waiting on Chris Paul. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=626.9s)]
*  Next two word NBA thing. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=630.62s)]
*  LeBron's Psy-Up. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=634.26s)]
*  So LeBron's going to take less money. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=636.9s)]
*  This came out today. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=641.8199999999999s)]
*  It's going to take less money if they get a free agent that he wants. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=642.74s)]
*  He's not, he's not running the Lakers. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=648.38s)]
*  The Lakers are running themselves. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=650.34s)]
*  They hire the coach themselves. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=651.74s)]
*  They're doing all the draft picks themselves. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=653.14s)]
*  He doesn't even weigh in on that stuff. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=654.8199999999999s)]
*  He doesn't weigh in at all, even though the guy who was doing podcasts with, and [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=656.3s)]
*  then Rich Paul has, as Russell pointed out last week was like, if we wanted them [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=659.8199999999999s)]
*  to take them at 17, we'd tell them to take them at 17. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=663.6999999999999s)]
*  So now we have LeBron will take less money if. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=667.02s)]
*  So does that mean there's a list? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=672.38s)]
*  Did he give a list of four people? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=674.38s)]
*  Like he's like, I will take 15 million less a year of Clay Thompson, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=677.8599999999999s)]
*  Caldwell Pope, and it's like two others. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=683.98s)]
*  But then he'd be like, but I'm not telling them what to do. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=687.38s)]
*  No, I'm just telling you, I would be willing to take less money. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=690.3000000000001s)]
*  Also does the free agent then have to take less money? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=693.6600000000001s)]
*  My point is, why do we have to pretend he's not running the Lakers? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=696.1s)]
*  Like, how long do we have to do this? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=699.14s)]
*  How long? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=703.3000000000001s)]
*  Give us a date. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=705.38s)]
*  By the way, he should run the Lakers. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=706.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, I thought he should coach the Lakers. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=708.7800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they, I thought they should have hired Maverick Carter as the coach. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=710.6600000000001s)]
*  And then I could just told him what to do. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=713.46s)]
*  I think LeBron is player coach. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=715.7s)]
*  I broke that, broke that takeout several times. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=717.62s)]
*  There was like, nah, I'm like, everyone says like, nah, it's not going to work. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=720.6600000000001s)]
*  And then I would say, why? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=724.86s)]
*  And why is it seven coaches in the last like 12 years? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=726.38s)]
*  He's the smartest basketball player. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=730.38s)]
*  Maybe we've ever had one of the smartest basketball players ever had in [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=732.4200000000001s)]
*  the history of the league. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=735.26s)]
*  He knows all the players. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=737.02s)]
*  He knows all the plays. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=738.6600000000001s)]
*  Let him run the show. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=740.58s)]
*  It's just, it would work. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=742.5s)]
*  I was like, well, the substitutions like, no, he'd be fine. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=745.58s)]
*  It's just weird that nobody's just admitting what the reality of situation [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=748.74s)]
*  is for just all this stuff. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=752.7s)]
*  Even like as people are doing gymnastics, trying to like, I thought it was cool [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=755.38s)]
*  that they took Ronnie 55, that's great. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=759.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=761.54s)]
*  But then people are doing the gymnastics of, well, you know, that first day in [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=762.74s)]
*  the combine and he looked and it's like, just stop. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=766.02s)]
*  They took him because he's LeBron's son. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=768.3s)]
*  Like, why are we doing this? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=769.82s)]
*  Well, he also did well in the combine. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=771.1s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=772.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=772.62s)]
*  He did well for one day. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=773.22s)]
*  Next, next two word thing. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=775.1400000000001s)]
*  Unless you have any, I think the Lakers could actually contend for a title [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=778.62s)]
*  takes you want to get out. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=782.1400000000001s)]
*  I don't think that at all. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=782.98s)]
*  No, I think they're, they're same as same as last year. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=785.1400000000001s)]
*  I am a little bit worried. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=788.5400000000001s)]
*  No one has talked about this bill. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=789.82s)]
*  Are we worried about the Olympics taking a toll on these guys? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=791.74s)]
*  Oh, I like the concern in your voice. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=795.22s)]
*  It was the way you delivered that. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=798.6600000000001s)]
*  I just sent chills down my spine. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=800.6600000000001s)]
*  I see a take coming down the take highway of the Lakers with the league, like, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=802.46s)]
*  says, like throw some good games on the Lakers early schedule and the Lakers [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=809.0600000000001s)]
*  start slow and it's like, ah, the Olympics, you know, a lot of extra games. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=813.74s)]
*  AD was out there. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=821.7800000000001s)]
*  You know, we won the gold. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=823.46s)]
*  That was great and all, but you know, it's going to be a slow start. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=824.5s)]
*  Especially after they went all out and the in-season tournament. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=828.06s)]
*  And then they would, they go Oh, and five or one in six. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=831.3s)]
*  It was the in-season tournament. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=834.66s)]
*  How hard the season was. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=836.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=837.5s)]
*  And it hurt them. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=837.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=839.5799999999999s)]
*  All of a sudden you're playing Denver. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=839.74s)]
*  So that, that take is coming around down take highway. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=840.78s)]
*  I guess we're going to have a lot of time to talk about it. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=846.5799999999999s)]
*  I guess I don't, they, they basically have two different versions of the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=848.9799999999999s)]
*  Olympic team for, I did from an identity standpoint, I don't know which identity [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=852.14s)]
*  is going to win because you have the old generation guys, the LeBron, Durant, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=857.38s)]
*  Curry, you have all those guys, but then you have like this young up and comer [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=862.1s)]
*  generation and you have 12 guys and you have five spots and you have. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=865.5s)]
*  240 minutes total. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=871.9s)]
*  And I just don't know like how it shakes out. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=873.78s)]
*  I don't know who plays crunch time. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=875.9s)]
*  You know, there's, there's going to be some absurd stuff, especially [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=878.14s)]
*  like if Kawhi doesn't play and they have Derek White, Derek White will [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=880.74s)]
*  make it if Kawhi gets scratched. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=884.94s)]
*  And you have Derek White and drew holiday. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=886.6600000000001s)]
*  It's like, you know, who could probably shut down the really shifty dude from [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=888.26s)]
*  some country we've never heard of those two guys, so that, you know, it's just [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=891.9000000000001s)]
*  going to be, uh, it's going to be, it's a team I would not want to coach. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=896.94s)]
*  I'll just put it that way. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=900.9000000000001s)]
*  No, I thought, have you looked at, oh, you tweeted team Canada. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=902.3000000000001s)]
*  I got this take from you. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=905.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=906.34s)]
*  Team Canada. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=907.34s)]
*  Although Zach, Edie got scratched. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=908.7s)]
*  I was sad. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=910.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=911.9000000000001s)]
*  I thought, I thought Zach Edie would have been a monster. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=912.3000000000001s)]
*  Come off the bench for like three minutes off the legal goal, attending stuff. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=915.78s)]
*  My team, Canada scares me. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=921.14s)]
*  Well, I had the, I had the Lakers 14th on my list, but we'll see if they get, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=923.14s)]
*  I, you know, the connecting was great for them. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=927.74s)]
*  He might be able to actually play a little bit for them next year. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=929.42s)]
*  Um, defensively is the issue for them, which is so funny that people are like, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=932.5799999999999s)]
*  they need shooting, they need shooting. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=936.26s)]
*  It's like, that's not how they won in 2020. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=937.42s)]
*  They won cause the LeBron and Davis and defense and a couple of people made some [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=939.62s)]
*  shots just, and they have a. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=942.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, rookie head coach, maybe it'll work. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=945.34s)]
*  Maybe it won't. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=947.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=949.0200000000001s)]
*  I have a couple more two word NBA things for you. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=949.2600000000001s)]
*  Title curse. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=953.4200000000001s)]
*  I like that. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=956.98s)]
*  We, it's like Jeopardy where you just put it out there and I have to guess. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=957.6600000000001s)]
*  You have to guess what I'll take the 2019 warriors for 200 bill. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=961.2600000000001s)]
*  Um, so the words were the last back to back next year, you know, that Durant [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=965.7s)]
*  and clay went down 19 Raptors, Kauai leaves, 20 Lakers, never recaptured it. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=972.26s)]
*  21 bucks. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=978.78s)]
*  It felt like Giannis was poised to win multiple titles. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=980.34s)]
*  Now they feel further away than probably they have five years, 22 warriors, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=982.98s)]
*  tailspin, and this leads us to the 23 nuggets, your nuggets. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=986.98s)]
*  The KCP thing hurt today. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=993.38s)]
*  And I don't know who's Bruce Brown last year and KCP this year. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=996.74s)]
*  And I get it. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1000.58s)]
*  You look at his playoffs stats and it's like, Hey, our J points a game. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1001.58s)]
*  He shot 32% from three and you know, we could probably replace that, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1004.5400000000001s)]
*  but that's not the point. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1008.1800000000001s)]
*  Like he fit in with those guys and he was an excellent defensive player. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1009.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1012.86s)]
*  So, so I don't know who's filling that role. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1013.9000000000001s)]
*  Uh, some young, young rookies that they're keeping their fingers crossed on [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1016.86s)]
*  and not young rookies, young players like a Watson and Strother, people like that. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1021.26s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1025.06s)]
*  But I still like, he's been good. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1025.98s)]
*  Christian Brown is he, he did. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1028.1399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1031.62s)]
*  Did it look like he was ready for like big time playoff minutes? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1032.6599999999999s)]
*  No, I would have preferred Bruce Brown back. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1036.3s)]
*  They would have said that about half time, half court shot, Peyton Pritchard [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1039.3s)]
*  a year ago. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1042.74s)]
*  Now what's he doing? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1044.54s)]
*  Taking five steps and sinking 55 footers and final scams. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1045.5s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I, I'm, uh, I would like Denver to find one more guy. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1049.74s)]
*  That can create their own shot. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1058.54s)]
*  Just, you mean like a Russell Westbrook? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1061.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1064.3s)]
*  If, if Russ is going to, if Russ signs and can just run the second unit, I mean, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1065.3s)]
*  this would be ideal for him. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1071.54s)]
*  This would be ideal for him. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1073.9399999999998s)]
*  Well, it sounds like definitely they did the mutual interest tweets. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1076.02s)]
*  I love those. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1080.4199999999998s)]
*  I like that. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1081.06s)]
*  Any eyeball tweets? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1081.6599999999999s)]
*  If it's like eyeball tweet. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1082.82s)]
*  Last night, people were tweeting Kevin Wilds and Bill Simmons have mutual [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1084.74s)]
*  interest in appearing on a Sunday night podcast together. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1088.5s)]
*  And I just put the eyeballs out. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1091.06s)]
*  I had, here's my take on Russ. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1095.86s)]
*  And you've probably done this when you've been out with Jacoby. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1099.5s)]
*  You know how people do fireball shots? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1102.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1104.74s)]
*  And it seems like a great idea and super fun. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1106.98s)]
*  So you want to do fireball shots? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1109.18s)]
*  Like, yeah, let's do some fireball shots. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1110.66s)]
*  That'll be fun. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1112.3799999999999s)]
*  Some multiple year. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1112.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1114.26s)]
*  They, they went maybe another round later. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1116.1000000000001s)]
*  It's like, yeah, those are tasty fireball shots. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1118.14s)]
*  Sure. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1120.98s)]
*  And then like an hour later, you just feel sick. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1121.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1123.94s)]
*  I feel like that's right. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1124.6200000000001s)]
*  That's the narrative of, well, bring in Russ. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1126.46s)]
*  He can run the second team. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1129.42s)]
*  And I thought Russ was pretty good last year for the Clippers for the most [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1131.1000000000001s)]
*  part, until the playoffs, when he was reprehensible. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1134.1000000000001s)]
*  Um, but he, isn't he a little fool's Goldie at this point? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1136.7800000000002s)]
*  Nobody has ever made this work where it's like, we're a really good team. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1140.9399999999998s)]
*  And then we'll have Russ and Russ will come in and this will work for eight months. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1143.82s)]
*  We just haven't seen it yet. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1148.06s)]
*  We've seen it work for four months. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1149.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1152.34s)]
*  You like the rebounding. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1153.6999999999998s)]
*  I love the rebounding. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1155.7399999999998s)]
*  I love the intensity of course. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1156.78s)]
*  You know, the idea of like, can anyone unlock? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1159.4599999999998s)]
*  Like, how can you be super intense and not great on defense at the same time? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1162.7399999999998s)]
*  It's, it's this odd thing. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1167.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1170.06s)]
*  So if somehow that can get unlocked later in his career, maybe. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1171.26s)]
*  The one thing with him that he did during the Clippers game, which I talked about on [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1176.1s)]
*  the pod, especially the first half of the year was he would just come in and [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1179.58s)]
*  completely change the energy of games. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1183.82s)]
*  And maybe that maybe Denver's thinking he could do that. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1185.82s)]
*  It's a trainable deal. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1189.78s)]
*  It'd be like four, four million. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1190.7399999999998s)]
*  Cause he, I would do it. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1192.34s)]
*  And so, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1193.1799999999998s)]
*  Denver would also give up these leads sometimes, like there was a point for [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1194.06s)]
*  having the MVP on the floor. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1198.06s)]
*  That. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1200.86s)]
*  We couldn't, we like, I don't like it just rooted for him, but now I'm on the team. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1202.58s)]
*  Denver couldn't stop the bleeding. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1206.6999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1209.26s)]
*  Mavs come back regularly and that Spurs come back like guys stops like stop. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1209.4599999999998s)]
*  Like it's just the energy was wrong. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1215.34s)]
*  If jokers off and Jamal Murray's off and the other guys are deaf, like [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1217.6999999999998s)]
*  Aaron Gordon's not going to like just be like, all right, let me just get to the [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1221.8999999999999s)]
*  line and get a free throw. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1225.34s)]
*  Like, no, he's not going to do that. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1226.62s)]
*  But if Russ could come in like, all right, it's Russ time. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1228.58s)]
*  I'm going to grab an offensive rebound and get one, get foul. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1230.8999999999999s)]
*  There's something to stop the bleeding. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1233.74s)]
*  I think that would be helpful. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1235.5s)]
*  So yeah, I'm all in on Russ. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1237.6599999999999s)]
*  This would be for Russ to play with Yoke Edge. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1239.7s)]
*  He would be moving up the ladders of most great teammates somebody has had over [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1243.74s)]
*  the course of a career. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1247.62s)]
*  It's a great point. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1249.5s)]
*  Think back to like, he was with Durant, Durant and Harden. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1250.1399999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1254.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1255.34s)]
*  And then he was with Paul George and then he went back to Harden and then he [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1256.06s)]
*  played with LeBron and Davis and then he played with Kawhi and Paul George and [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1262.1s)]
*  Harden. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1267.06s)]
*  He played with Harden three different times and now he's going to play with [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1269.26s)]
*  Yoke Edge. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1271.94s)]
*  She's basically played with like 80% of the meaningful guys from the last 15 [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1272.34s)]
*  years and won one finals game. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1277.6200000000001s)]
*  Um, I don't mind it for 4 million. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1282.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1285.62s)]
*  I love it. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1285.78s)]
*  I feel like there would be more teams that would want to grab them for $4 [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1286.54s)]
*  million. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1289.5s)]
*  Here's my next two word. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1291.26s)]
*  Thanks for great guy to have in the building. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1292.18s)]
*  Let's see if he can guess this one. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1294.7s)]
*  Eighth grade. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1295.94s)]
*  That's the only hint. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1300.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1301.74s)]
*  Is it about like some like long-term pick? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1303.7s)]
*  Like somebody's first round pick? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1306.6599999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1308.98s)]
*  It's currently. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1309.22s)]
*  I just think the NBA, my biggest criticism with the NBA is they're like a [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1310.74s)]
*  bunch of eighth grade girls far too often for me having went through it with [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1316.02s)]
*  a daughter. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1320.9s)]
*  We're just like these little slates and people getting pissed and it's like, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1321.46s)]
*  you guys are professional athletes who make a shitload of money. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1324.42s)]
*  This is an actual Brian Winhorse quote today. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1327.02s)]
*  Shout out to Wendy, our guy. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1329.8600000000001s)]
*  When they signed Kawhi to that deal, they never told Paul George about it. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1332.1000000000001s)]
*  With the insinuation being he's, he's had his, his, uh, I don't know. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1336.38s)]
*  He's been perturbed ever since. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1341.0600000000002s)]
*  It's like, really? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1343.38s)]
*  We're doing this. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1343.9s)]
*  They paid Paul George like $220 million. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1344.7800000000002s)]
*  There's just, um, you know what? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1349.22s)]
*  I'm gonna start, I'll maybe do half baked ideas later in the show. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1350.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1354.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm just going to give you, I'm going to give you a quick one right now. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1354.3000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to come in like Winston Wolf in pulp fiction. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1357.3400000000001s)]

*  In my, and they're going to call me the communicator. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1362.5400000000002s)]
*  Like, Hey, like before I off at front office does anything like, Hey, call [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1364.94s)]
*  the communicator and I come in in a tuxedo and I run through a quick checklist. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1369.6200000000001s)]
*  Like, Hey, did you tell your star player? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1375.74s)]
*  Did you, did you, did you tell the star players agent? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1378.06s)]
*  Did you tell the wide receiver? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1381.22s)]
*  Did you tell the quarterback you're about to do? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1382.7s)]
*  Did you tell Wolfsh? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1384.5s)]
*  Did you tell Wendy? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1385.18s)]
*  Like, and we're all, we're gonna have it all coordinated so that the wide [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1385.9s)]
*  receivers not getting traded and you didn't hear about it, you didn't hear [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1389.5s)]
*  about it, you didn't hear about it. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1392.5s)]
*  You heard about it right before. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1393.26s)]
*  Well, how come you can't weigh in? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1394.1s)]
*  Like it's always a mess and these guys can never figure it out and people [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1395.9s)]
*  get their feelings hurt. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1400.78s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1402.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1403.46s)]
*  I have the communicator. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1403.62s)]
*  No, you know how they have for movie sets now, they have the intimacy coordinators. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1404.86s)]
*  You're the emotion. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1409.58s)]
*  You're the emotional coordinator. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1410.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1412.18s)]
*  I'm I show, but I have to be on set. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1412.42s)]
*  Like, what are you about to do? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1414.86s)]
*  We're about to sign this deal. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1416.46s)]
*  We're about to offer the deal. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1417.74s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1419.34s)]
*  We're going to get everybody on zoom. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1419.86s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1421.46s)]
*  We're going to get everybody on zoom. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1421.94s)]
*  Maybe it's just the title is intimacy coordinator. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1423.1399999999999s)]
*  You're just on the set. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1425.54s)]
*  Probably too much. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1426.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm just a dull communicator. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1427.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm in touch with you. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1428.4199999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1429.22s)]
*  I like that. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1430.82s)]
*  That's good. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1431.3799999999999s)]
*  More two words, sunk costs. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1434.1799999999998s)]
*  This got Chris Haynes reported this today. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1436.1399999999999s)]
*  The Bulls offered Zach Levine for CP3 and Wiggins. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1438.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1442.02s)]
*  Why? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1442.1799999999998s)]
*  What was the deal there? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1442.58s)]
*  Why didn't they do that? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1443.86s)]
*  And the words were like, no, thank you. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1444.86s)]
*  Which tells me that Zach Levine is now untradeable in a sunk cost because you [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1448.06s)]
*  had the warriors who were like, we're, we have more money than God. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1451.94s)]
*  We've paid the luxury tax every year for seven straight years. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1455.6200000000001s)]
*  And we can basically, cause we're losing Chris Paul anyway, we could turn [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1458.46s)]
*  Andrew Wiggins into a guy who scored 25 points a game for the last nine years. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1461.82s)]
*  No, thanks. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1466.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1467.74s)]
*  That was a strange one. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1467.8600000000001s)]
*  I think that speaks to his value though. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1469.74s)]
*  It makes me think the Bulls are going to be stuck with him either way. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1471.6200000000001s)]
*  Um, let's do Chris Paul and Wemby. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1477.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1480.58s)]
*  So Orlando gets KCP and I'm super excited for our guys Saruti because I'm [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1482.14s)]
*  thinking Chris Paul is in play now for Orlando and there's, you know, they're [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1489.5s)]
*  50 to one on Fandl right now. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1492.9s)]
*  It's like, ah, I'm not saying they'll win the title, but 50 to one. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1494.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1497.54s)]
*  Could they, could they be like a two seed, you know, if they got Chris Paul [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1498.18s)]
*  and Palo jumps, Franz learns how to shoot threes, Franz takes over the [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1502.94s)]
*  Olympics, Germany has a couple of upsets, like there's a roadmap for stuff to happen. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1507.02s)]
*  Holy cow. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1511.7s)]
*  But then Chris Paul goes to this first. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1512.98s)]
*  And that was even more delightful and more exciting. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1515.54s)]
*  So I love this. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1518.54s)]
*  What do you, when we won, they, when they were tanking, they won 22 games. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1520.22s)]
*  Then they get the best prospect since LeBron and they won 22 games. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1526.54s)]
*  Well, I mean, they really tried hard to lose those 22 games. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1532.66s)]
*  They had no point guard and they played G leaguers for the last six weeks of the season. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1535.74s)]
*  So what does success look like now that I've cast a little bit of love from [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1539.9s)]
*  Yukon, but they traded Dillingham. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1543.9s)]
*  So it felt like, all right, are we, are we not, we just don't, we want to just [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1546.46s)]
*  still send stuff towards the future. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1550.94s)]
*  By the way, I'm glad you brought that up really quick because I did the pod on [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1552.42s)]
*  Wednesday night and I didn't like the Dillingham trade and as I've had time to [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1555.46s)]
*  marinate it and think about it, it actually makes me mad. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1558.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't know why they didn't just keep them. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1561.46s)]
*  Well, now they have Chris Paul. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1563.54s)]
*  I like it. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1564.94s)]
*  Well, one rookie, one veteran. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1565.54s)]
*  You know what'd been cool? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1567.3400000000001s)]
*  Chris Paul could have taught Rob Dillingham how to do stuff like he did with [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1567.98s)]
*  Shay Gildes Alexander for that year they had an OKC together and Shay's like, that [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1571.74s)]
*  was the most important thing that ever happened to me being with Chris Paul for [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1575.8600000000001s)]
*  a year. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1579.02s)]
*  So I, so I love it, but what does success look like for Wemby? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1580.46s)]
*  Be basically last year's Rockets. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1584.38s)]
*  Like, Hey, we might make the play in. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1586.26s)]
*  We did that. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1590.5s)]
*  We did this ringer top hundred thing. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1591.06s)]
*  Mm. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1593.22s)]
*  And I had Wemby at number 10. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1594.5s)]
*  I was like, I'm just not ever not having them in the top 10 for the rest of my [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1599.1000000000001s)]
*  life. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1602.5s)]
*  If he's healthy, who's sandwich between Wemba, Nama, 10 Davis, 11 Durant, 12 [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1602.78s)]
*  Mitchell, 13 Jalen Brown, 14 Jamal Murray, 15 and bead was nine. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1610.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1615.1000000000001s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1615.5s)]
*  Brunson? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1616.14s)]
*  You have Brunson top. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1617.06s)]
*  Oh, I had Jalen Brunson six. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1618.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1620.3s)]
*  Good. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1620.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1621.22s)]
*  Good. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1621.38s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I liked, I think that's fair. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1622.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, he could hit top. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1624.54s)]
*  I'd have to do it. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1628.1s)]
*  I think you could easily move up though. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1629.6599999999999s)]
*  It'd be better than indeed. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1632.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, Kevin O'Connor who works for the ringer. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1634.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1638.82s)]
*  He had a couple of insane Wemby takes. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1639.06s)]
*  I almost, I almost texted him to make sure he was all right. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1641.02s)]
*  It's hard to have a take that's too hot on Wemby. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1645.34s)]
*  Well, he texted 26, 12, six and four for one medium of the season, all star on [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1648.5s)]
*  the defensive player of the year. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1654.74s)]
*  I'm like, all right, I can buy that. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1655.94s)]
*  But then he said, I could be underestimating him by the second half of the season. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1657.94s)]
*  Wemby might be at 32, 13, eight and five. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1661.42s)]
*  I'm like, okay, I'm going to send you some title and all. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1664.46s)]
*  I mean, that, if he, could he do that at some point in his career? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1670.82s)]
*  I'm going to say yes. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1674.06s)]
*  But in year two with the team he has, I'm going to say no, but it's really hard. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1675.4599999999998s)]
*  We went and saw him at the garden and he's thoroughly outplayed by heart and [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1680.26s)]
*  spine thoroughly outplayed. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1684.9399999999998s)]
*  Then that was, but there was early in his, uh, early in the season. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1687.6999999999998s)]
*  Then I don't know when he turned the corner, he's kind of like figured it out [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1692.98s)]
*  and he just kept figuring it out all the way to the end of the season. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1696.3s)]
*  He's like AI. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1700.86s)]
*  It's like how AI can figure out our habits. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1701.98s)]
*  No, it's even, it's a hundred times better than it was last week. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1705.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1710.54s)]
*  He was like that stretch he had in that last game that ended up knocking [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1710.6999999999998s)]
*  Denver out of the one seed. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1715.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1716.62s)]
*  When he scored the 17 points in three minutes, that was like, holy shit. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1717.06s)]
*  So he's going to come back. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1721.2199999999998s)]
*  Now he has a point guard. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1722.02s)]
*  Castle will be awesome for them immediately, at least on defense. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1723.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1727.82s)]
*  He just, he's out here working with Jamal Crawford. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1728.06s)]
*  I think he's going to be. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1731.2199999999998s)]
*  Un, unbelievable, but can you, they, what's a fair expectation? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1732.94s)]
*  Am I allowed to be disappointed if they win 30 games? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1737.06s)]
*  I think so. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1741.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm having a hard time like this all time, great prospect. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1742.66s)]
*  Like, I know LeBron didn't make the playoffs early on either, but still [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1746.6200000000001s)]
*  the history is it happens sooner than you think. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1750.54s)]
*  And that was why I was so bullish. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1753.98s)]
*  I know KC last year where I was like, I thought they're going to win 50 games, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1755.26s)]
*  the whole thing, because it usually moves faster, especially with young legs. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1758.94s)]
*  They're healthier. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1763.1000000000001s)]
*  They're more durable. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1763.7s)]
*  I had San Antonio. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1765.26s)]
*  When I did that tiers, I had Memphis 16 Houston, Sacramento, Golden [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1767.6200000000001s)]
*  State clips, San Antonio as my next six. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1771.98s)]
*  And that's why the West is so hard. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1776.9s)]
*  Cause you think like, none of those are even the top teams in the West. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1779.6200000000001s)]
*  I know like the teams I just rattled off, like you have okay. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1783.46s)]
*  See Denver, Minnesota, Dallas. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1786.54s)]
*  There's four, then you have Phoenix, New Orleans, and the Lakers. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1788.26s)]
*  There's seven. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1791.74s)]
*  And then you have Memphis, Houston, Sacramento, Golden State clips, San [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1793.14s)]
*  Antonio, just for the eight seed. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1796.42s)]
*  So what's success probably probably 35 wins and some fun upsets. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1798.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1803.34s)]
*  But 35 wins. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1803.74s)]
*  I want more. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1805.3s)]
*  The Rockets went 41 and 41. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1806.06s)]
*  You could be the Rockets. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1809.58s)]
*  They had a nice little wind streak. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1810.42s)]
*  You should be just as good as the Rockets. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1811.74s)]
*  Got a great coach. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1813.9s)]
*  Got now you've got a veteran. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1815.34s)]
*  I don't know if they have the Rockets had more depth though. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1816.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1819.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1820.22s)]
*  Although the Rockets might go backwards this year because your guys [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1821.6200000000001s)]
*  Shangoons coming back and it's Jalen Green's team now it's going to be a [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1824.2600000000002s)]
*  tug of war, it's going to be like New Jack city. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1827.42s)]
*  No, so there, there'll be, it'll work perfectly. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1829.2600000000002s)]
*  Don't worry about that. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1832.0200000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1832.98s)]
*  I mean, we'll see. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1833.42s)]
*  Well, you see the Shangoon for Durant trades, trying to pop up. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1835.42s)]
*  When did that happen? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1840.0200000000002s)]
*  That popped up like, whoa, that was a little, whoa, that was a little [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1841.22s)]
*  woge peripheral woge. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1844.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't think woge ever mentioned it, but then people took that and splintered [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1846.02s)]
*  off Shangoon for woe, Shangoon for Durant. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1849.46s)]
*  I started to get nervous. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1853.58s)]
*  I was thinking that was the one the words are never trading Curry. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1855.3799999999999s)]
*  Just going to say that. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1858.98s)]
*  But if Curry ever said, you guys have to trade me, it's less teams than you [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1861.98s)]
*  think, but Houston would have a Godfather offer possibility because of all the [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1866.94s)]
*  picks they have, they have shepherd and they have Shangoon and all their wings. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1871.26s)]
*  Like they could just go, he's not going to dream on would have to be in the [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1875.66s)]
*  deal would have to be the two of them, but they're never trading step Curry. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1879.22s)]
*  I think the words are rather just suck every year than trade step Curry. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1882.74s)]
*  And that's how they should feel. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1885.46s)]
*  That's how we would have felt about Larry Bird way back when I'd rather suck [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1886.42s)]
*  and have Larry Bird retire than us with us then. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1891.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1894.02s)]
*  And that's what hurts Clay's feelings though. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1894.22s)]
*  So that's, that's why. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1896.22s)]
*  You know, though, I'm glad you brought this up. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1898.38s)]
*  I did the research on this. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1901.5800000000002s)]
*  I wanted to figure out, cause I think Clay is a top hundred guy. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1903.42s)]
*  He made my pyramid. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1906.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1907.5s)]
*  Number 77. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1908.02s)]
*  Oh, top hundred all time, all time. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1909.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1912.1s)]
*  All time. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1912.3s)]
*  I looked up how many top hundred guys played for one team their whole career. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1915.06s)]
*  And it's about 30%. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1921.02s)]
*  The guys move like you had the top level of the MJ Russell bird magic, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1925.06s)]
*  Kobe West, those guys don't move. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1929.22s)]
*  You've had with you. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1931.3s)]
*  MJ, MJ, you don't count MJ moving. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1931.9s)]
*  You give that one. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1935.02s)]
*  Oh, I guess I have to cancel that one. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1936.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1937.7s)]
*  I kind of don't count the wizards, but I guess I have to. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1938.02s)]
*  All right. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1940.46s)]
*  Sorry, MJ. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1940.8200000000002s)]
*  You're out. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1941.5s)]
*  But then when it's basically like every tier, like half of them, but then when it [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1944.1000000000001s)]
*  gets to the guys, like over 50, like in the, in the clay group, it's really only [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1949.3000000000002s)]
*  Reggie Miller and Joe Dumars, Manu and Tony Parker were the guys that like his [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1955.02s)]
*  level that actually just stayed the whole time. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1960.18s)]
*  A lot of times these guys bounce around and we're just, it's how it goes. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1962.18s)]
*  Even Pippen played with Portland and Houston and Chicago. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1965.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1970.26s)]
*  He needed to go get his money. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1970.5800000000002s)]
*  This is just, all right, that's clay. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1972.5s)]
*  I'm just bummed out. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1974.5s)]
*  I'll be happy when he's, when he's doing well. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1975.22s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you where I'm not going to be happy. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1977.8600000000001s)]
*  It's because the Lakers, cause I love clay Thompson. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1981.5800000000002s)]
*  I don't want the Lakers to have somebody I like. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1983.8600000000001s)]
*  And they're the Boston Reaves. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1986.7800000000002s)]
*  So I like, and that that's been tough enough for me. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1987.8200000000002s)]
*  I think I, I would like to have him. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1991.14s)]
*  I've I would like to see what JJ draws up for him. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1993.9s)]
*  He's like, Ooh, like just JJ would just like a pure shooter. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=1996.98s)]
*  It's like, Oh, this is my favorite one. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2000.74s)]
*  Clay, do you like this? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2002.0200000000002s)]
*  He's like, yes. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2002.9s)]
*  Great. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2004.7800000000002s)]
*  Also, this is the, this will be. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2005.46s)]
*  So your listeners, the dumbest reason ever. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2008.42s)]
*  I want to see clay on the Lakers also just kind of want them in a yellow, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2011.9s)]
*  yellow uniform, yellow, yellow. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2015.38s)]
*  Jersey. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2019.94s)]
*  It's like, Oh yeah, I kind of like that. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2020.42s)]
*  Good. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2022.46s)]
*  Cool. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2023.26s)]
*  Gold. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2023.6200000000001s)]
*  That's perfect. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2024.22s)]
*  Rudy says that. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2024.74s)]
*  Woj said LeBron James called clay Thompson right at 6 PM. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2026.26s)]
*  He's not running the Lakers though. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2030.22s)]
*  He's just calling them. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2032.26s)]
*  Check in. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2033.66s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2034.66s)]
*  There's another clay Thompson piece, which is why I think the Lakers would [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2034.94s)]
*  have the inside track is his, his dad. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2038.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2041.42s)]
*  I think that's nice. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2041.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2042.46s)]
*  I think that's kind of a significant, like everyone's like, Oh, I can go to Dallas. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2042.7s)]
*  It's like, if he can go to the Lakers, he's going to Lakers. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2046.22s)]
*  That's the only way leaving Golden State. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2048.38s)]
*  Same way. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2050.7400000000002s)]
*  Like if Curry ever leaves the Warriors, I think it would be Charlotte. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2051.1800000000003s)]
*  God, I know that would be a nice story theoretically, but that'd be horrible. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2054.7000000000003s)]
*  Came on Charlotte. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2059.34s)]
*  Charlotte's coming back, man. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2061.2200000000003s)]
*  They hired a good coach. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2062.5800000000004s)]
*  I got Brandon Miller. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2064.1400000000003s)]
*  I think. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2065.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2066.2200000000003s)]
*  I guess so. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2066.82s)]
*  Um, the only other free agency things, I think we hit every single thing that [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2068.7400000000002s)]
*  happened, right? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2075.6200000000003s)]
*  Did we miss anything? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2076.5800000000004s)]
*  Oh, there was a couple of funny ones. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2078.06s)]
*  Val and Shewness went to the wizards for three for 30, which I just loved. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2080.8199999999997s)]
*  We always need like a weird one. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2084.46s)]
*  We were like, wait, what? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2085.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2087.14s)]
*  Who went with that? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2087.38s)]
*  I thought three for 30 was actually an okay deal. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2088.7s)]
*  Pretty good deal. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2090.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2091.5s)]
*  Tradable. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2091.7s)]
*  Um, quickly went to Toronto, resigning for five for one 75. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2093.14s)]
*  And I, I honestly don't fucking know what Toronto is doing. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2099.18s)]
*  That happened, uh, before today, but they're shelling out a 460 million for [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2103.1s)]
*  Emmanuel quickly and Scotty Barnes. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2109.02s)]
*  I probably would have not signed off on that. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2112.14s)]
*  And then the other weird one was Patrick Williams back to [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2114.7799999999997s)]
*  Chicago for five years, 90 million. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2118.14s)]
*  What is Chicago doing? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2120.94s)]
*  I just don't, what are they doing? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2122.58s)]
*  So I thought that was pretty, pretty strange as well. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2125.9s)]
*  And then the only other thing we didn't talk about was the. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2129.58s)]
*  Dejante Murray Pelicans trade, which I really liked that he was [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2132.14s)]
*  like exactly what they needed. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2135.54s)]
*  I 100% agree. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2137.46s)]
*  Um, but I don't know what to think of the Pelicans. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2139.74s)]
*  I'm just, they need a center and they need to trade brand and [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2143.7s)]
*  Ingram and everybody thinks they're trading them to Sacramento for. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2146.42s)]
*  I guess it would be like Harrison Barnes and Kevin Herder and [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2150.54s)]
*  picks and basically dumping them. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2153.02s)]
*  They lost Daniels in the Murray trade. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2155.54s)]
*  They lost a couple of their weaker picks, their team right now, Zion [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2157.8999999999996s)]
*  Murray, Herb Jones, Trey Murphy, McCollum, Hawkins, Alvarado and Ingram. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2162.02s)]
*  So no size at all. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2167.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2168.8199999999997s)]
*  The biggest thing that will happen is if OKC gets Hardenstein because [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2168.98s)]
*  we can talk about all this, all these, this guy moved here. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2173.2599999999998s)]
*  This guy's here. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2176.06s)]
*  Clay's gonna be on this team. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2176.8599999999997s)]
*  But like, if they end up with Caruso and Hardenstein this summer with the team [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2177.98s)]
*  they had with how close they were to beating Dallas anyway, in a series that [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2183.7s)]
*  really came down to, I said, like four rebounds and one dumb play in the corner [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2187.3799999999997s)]
*  and two made threes, um, to me, they're the favorite in the West. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2191.42s)]
*  Cause that's now you have a top five guy and Denver's weaker. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2201.06s)]
*  Minnesota. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2209.14s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2209.7799999999997s)]
*  We'll see what Dallas does. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2211.2599999999998s)]
*  But like just right now I'd have OKC is the team I felt the safest about. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2212.5s)]
*  Geez. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2216.74s)]
*  Cause I thought they were right there with Dallas, man. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2217.18s)]
*  Yeah, you're probably right. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2221.38s)]
*  It was just an, yeah. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2222.66s)]
*  I feel I have to, I'm still in like a Denver, uh, you know, I'm in a Denver [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2224.74s)]
*  malaise. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2231.7s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2232.86s)]
*  So I know we didn't hit absolutely everything, but I have a podcast Tuesday [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2233.1s)]
*  and I'll try to do winners and losers for anything we missed. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2236.02s)]
*  Let's talk about the Denver malaise. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2238.78s)]
*  Cause I think both of us are seeing this the same way. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2240.34s)]
*  It talked about a little on the title curse stuff where Milwaukee had this [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2243.0600000000004s)]
*  window with Yannis, then they jump and they do the Dame trade and they hire the [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2246.6600000000003s)]
*  wrong coach and last year's a throwaway. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2251.7000000000003s)]
*  And now they're really kind of on the clock with that. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2254.1000000000004s)]
*  I don't feel Denver still has that foundation of those four guys that play [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2256.1400000000003s)]
*  really well together, but KCP was the fifth. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2261.38s)]
*  Now they're going to play roulette with that swing spot, but just in general, it [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2264.1000000000004s)]
*  doesn't feel like they're adding. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2267.94s)]
*  It feels like they're kind of surviving with what they have. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2269.6600000000003s)]
*  And I think all of us are looking at it going, you guys have Yoke-age. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2272.38s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2276.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2277.54s)]
*  Like, but I don't know what move they're exactly supposed to make, but it seems [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2278.26s)]
*  like we're in an odd time in the NBA where all of the MVPs, so the last guys [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2282.38s)]
*  who have shared the MVP, Joker, Yannis and Embiid are all kind of on the outside [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2293.06s)]
*  looking in for either their second championship or first, if you're Embiid. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2298.62s)]
*  And it's going to be, and you think it's going to be Celtics, Celtics, well, not [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2304.02s)]
*  you think it's Celtics and OKC right now is your one, two. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2308.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2312.8599999999997s)]
*  So if you're looking at the, if you're looking at the East, it would be Celtics, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2314.18s)]
*  Knicks, and then we'll see what the Sixers and Bucks look like. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2318.62s)]
*  If you're looking at the West, it's OKC, Denver, Dallas, Minnesota, all kind of [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2323.22s)]
*  clumped together and kind of pick who you think is the safest bet, whether the [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2329.2599999999998s)]
*  one seed will matter with them. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2334.14s)]
*  But I just, I think OKC getting there a little like what happened to 22 Celtics. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2335.3799999999997s)]
*  Like the experience they had last year is going to really help them, you know, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2341.4599999999996s)]
*  and solving the giddy issue, which I think was a real issue for them because [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2344.9399999999996s)]
*  he wanted to start and, you know, they had a little bit of a chemistry thing. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2348.5s)]
*  And they fixed that. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2351.78s)]
*  Um, if they can get Hartenstein, I feel like that's a, that's as complete of a [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2353.2200000000003s)]
*  team as we're getting in the West. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2358.42s)]
*  And they have some good advantages because SGA's contracts is still cheap for [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2359.9s)]
*  superstar, Jaylen Williams is still on a rookie contract. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2363.86s)]
*  So is Chet. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2366.98s)]
*  Like they're, this is very similar to that 2012 window they had with all those guys. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2367.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2372.82s)]
*  So I, I like going back to Denver. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2372.98s)]
*  I liked the idea that Denver is like, we just won. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2375.3s)]
*  We're fine. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2378.38s)]
*  We just need to get healthy. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2379.46s)]
*  If Jamal was at full strength, we probably win again. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2381.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2385.94s)]
*  We were at 20 in a game seven and we blew it because we kind of ran out of gas. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2386.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2390.98s)]
*  If we were healthy, we'd be good. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2391.34s)]
*  And we ran into, you know, there's an element of like that team getting smacked, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2393.1400000000003s)]
*  you know, was a game, I'm sorry, what game was it? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2398.34s)]
*  Games, game six, they got smashed. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2401.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2403.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2404.6600000000003s)]
*  Like that left a bad taste in my mouth. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2405.42s)]
*  And then I'll be giving up the big lead left a bad taste in my mouth. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2408.18s)]
*  So is that just bad luck? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2412.22s)]
*  Is that just injuries or is that need to be remedied through a personnel decision? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2414.5s)]
*  And maybe that's Russ. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2418.66s)]
*  Maybe I'll feel fine. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2420.06s)]
*  Now, if I'm being honest on the other hand, like, man, all these guys are making [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2420.86s)]
*  moves, what are we doing? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2424.2599999999998s)]
*  We feel like we're even further away than we were last year. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2425.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2429.38s)]
*  Their first round pick was weird this year where they took like this total project [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2429.54s)]
*  who probably can't help them for a couple of years. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2433.78s)]
*  And meanwhile, the Lakers got connect who can at least come in and make some threes. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2435.82s)]
*  You know, I'm so, I'm so, I'm going to believe in Jamal Murray once he's healthy. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2439.9s)]
*  So I think I might get back on the Denver train, but not ready to [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2444.9s)]
*  make any official predictions. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2447.86s)]
*  Would you say he's. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2449.7000000000003s)]
*  I think I have one more year in his deal. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2451.6200000000003s)]
*  He hasn't signed it yet. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2454.26s)]
*  I assume that's getting done though. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2455.34s)]
*  I assume this is all a format. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2456.6200000000003s)]
*  They worried you that hit your worried meter. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2458.5800000000004s)]
*  I just didn't realize it was one year left. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2461.5s)]
*  You never know what these dudes. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2463.5800000000004s)]
*  So the variable of having won the title to me takes all the bets off the board. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2464.66s)]
*  I know it's great to keep winning in the same place. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2472.14s)]
*  And in his case, like he plays the world Yoke-age, but I just think when, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2475.18s)]
*  when people have rings, they just think slightly differently about it. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2478.98s)]
*  Like, ah, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2481.98s)]
*  Val Kuzma factor is a guy. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2482.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2485.3799999999997s)]
*  They want, they're not shit. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2486.06s)]
*  What are they chasing now? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2487.22s)]
*  They're chasing the, you know, security as much money as they can make. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2488.18s)]
*  I assume he's going to stay, but you know, what if Yoke-age is like, yo, man, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2493.42s)]
*  two years from now, I'm retiring from the NBA and I'm going to be riding [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2498.02s)]
*  horses in Serbia. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2500.5s)]
*  That's my plan. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2501.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2503.34s)]
*  Good. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2503.5s)]
*  And me and my brothers are opening a bar. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2503.74s)]
*  I just want to give you a heads up 20, 20, 27 of the out of the league. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2505.5s)]
*  So it's like, cool. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2509.7s)]
*  Thanks for telling me. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2510.86s)]
*  That's good. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2511.98s)]
*  Let's go hard for two years. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2512.38s)]
*  I'll extend three years. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2513.58s)]
*  I'll do a one and one. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2515.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we'll be fine. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2516.7s)]
*  Are you buying the Knicks? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2518.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2520.1s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2520.7s)]
*  100%. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2521.9s)]
*  That's a team that, you know, the Knicks remind me a little bit. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2523.58s)]
*  How, and this is, this is a half-baked theory so you can, you can refine it. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2529.18s)]
*  One of the things that makes football great. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2535.82s)]
*  The Ravens play like the Ravens, whether if you were in a coma for the last five [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2538.1s)]
*  years, you wake up, you're like, Oh yeah, Ravens football. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2542.46s)]
*  That's great. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2546.42s)]
*  And Sean McVeigh is doing his thing. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2547.02s)]
*  And the 49ers are, I mean, they've changed a little bit. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2548.9s)]
*  49ers are playing like 49. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2551.5s)]
*  Tibbs is coaching a team that feels totally unique in the NBA. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2554.14s)]
*  We're going to play everybody more. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2559.2200000000003s)]
*  We're going to play tough defense where we are not going on a, we're not building [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2560.82s)]
*  the roster through basically stars, blind dates, like, Nope, we're taking a bunch [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2567.5s)]
*  of friends and we actually have proof of concept at Villanova. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2572.98s)]
*  So I like that it's a signature look and feel of a team that reminds me of football. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2576.5s)]
*  Can I zag? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2584.98s)]
*  Yeah, go. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2586.38s)]
*  Julius Randall, how are they going to figure that out? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2588.18s)]
*  Not sure. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2592.18s)]
*  Not sure. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2594.78s)]
*  He's like, Hey, I'm a 24 and 10 guy. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2595.34s)]
*  Well, you know, this whole Villanova thing is cool and all, but I'm over here. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2597.7400000000002s)]
*  Hey, go watch. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2602.38s)]
*  He's always getting invited to watch the wildcats. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2603.38s)]
*  He's like, no guys, I don't. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2606.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2607.94s)]
*  I'm not more of a Kentucky. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2608.2200000000003s)]
*  No, that's, that's what I'm going to be doing all summer. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2612.82s)]
*  Cause the Knicks fans, and I'm really happy for them. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2615.26s)]
*  I was thinking about my friend Goldman who died in November of 2018 and just saw [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2618.58s)]
*  nothing happy at all. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2623.58s)]
*  And then within a couple of years, this flips and now it's like one of the most [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2625.06s)]
*  likable, not only NBA teams, but probably one of the most likable New York [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2630.38s)]
*  teams in a while. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2634.38s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2635.5s)]
*  So I, I, I don't want to like give my Knicks fan friend shit. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2636.1800000000003s)]
*  Cause I'm really happy for them. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2640.38s)]
*  But at the same time, if they're chest puffing too much, you just throw the, uh, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2641.58s)]
*  so what's going to happen with Randall, you think, and then they're just kind of [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2646.54s)]
*  like, ah, no, I'm fine. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2649.5s)]
*  There's something else like in its simplicity of just like, we show up to [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2651.78s)]
*  work every day. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2657.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2658.8199999999997s)]
*  We roll up our sleeves. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2659.1s)]
*  We're like, we're playing like, I haven't missed a game since I was eight years [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2660.98s)]
*  old. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2665.2599999999998s)]
*  It's just, there's like, yeah, we play like, why? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2665.7799999999997s)]
*  Cause I'm not going to miss a game. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2668.66s)]
*  You guys need me. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2669.8999999999996s)]
*  Like the fans are here for us every game. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2671.14s)]
*  So it's just really relatable and awesome. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2672.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2676.2999999999997s)]
*  Bridges is, I mean, he's even more durable than Jalen and Tatum who are like the [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2676.54s)]
*  most durable wings of the league. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2681.2999999999997s)]
*  Bridges just literally doesn't miss games ever. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2682.54s)]
*  It's going to be great. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2685.66s)]
*  It's going to be great. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2686.54s)]
*  It's good. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2687.26s)]
*  The best thing when you think about next year, which I think is going to be really [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2688.34s)]
*  fun in a lot of ways, just from the unpredictability angle, unfortunately, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2691.46s)]
*  the, you know, the Lakers are just going to dominate everything, which I'm just, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2697.0200000000004s)]
*  I guess we all have to accept. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2700.5400000000004s)]
*  Like even today ESPN did their free HD special in the first 15 [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2702.26s)]
*  minutes were about the Lakers. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2705.7400000000002s)]
*  So I'm like, Hey, Paul George, any info? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2706.82s)]
*  But you, you produce shows like that and people want the Lakers are the red meat. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2709.0600000000004s)]
*  Right? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2713.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2714.42s)]
*  The Lakers, you know, the marquee franchise, the Cowboys, Yankees, Lakers. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2714.7s)]
*  That's it. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2719.02s)]
*  Can't go wrong. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2719.3799999999997s)]
*  I get it. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2720.22s)]
*  Everyone's interested in the Lakers. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2720.66s)]
*  Everybody's interested, but it'd be nice if the New York got to be at that level. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2722.5s)]
*  I mean, it's New York. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2726.5s)]
*  Well, that's when I think about the season and the West is going to be so much fun [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2727.8599999999997s)]
*  with all these great players. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2732.1s)]
*  And then you have this, you know, assuming Paul George, we still don't know if he's [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2733.22s)]
*  officially signed, but you have this Celtics, Knicks, Sixers battle now with [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2737.3399999999997s)]
*  like stars and like every game is going to feel like it matters. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2744.22s)]
*  And it's just going to feel like out of like the seventies and eighties when those [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2747.7s)]
*  teams were going at it with each other. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2751.22s)]
*  And we haven't had, we haven't had the three of them going at the same time. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2753.62s)]
*  I don't even remember the last time. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2756.8599999999997s)]
*  Can I say one final thing? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2760.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2762.2599999999998s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2762.66s)]
*  We've done this whole podcast for almost two hours. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2763.5s)]
*  No, it's our hour 15. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2766.94s)]
*  Oh, hour 15. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2769.7s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2770.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2770.9s)]
*  Um, and if I was Janice listening to this podcast, like I was barely [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2771.4199999999996s)]
*  mentioned, I'm, I'm probably the best player. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2777.5s)]
*  I have a ring. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2782.7799999999997s)]
*  I had an off year off two years. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2784.2999999999997s)]
*  He didn't. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2787.8599999999997s)]
*  He had a really, he had a really good year. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2788.18s)]
*  His team. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2790.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2790.4199999999996s)]
*  I teamed it. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2790.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2791.5s)]
*  So like, it just feels like he's just on the outside looking in here and it's just, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2791.8199999999997s)]
*  it's, it's strange. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2797.06s)]
*  It's like, ah, it's going to be Philly, New York, Boston. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2799.3399999999997s)]
*  Cause what? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2801.98s)]
*  I'm the best player in the conference. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2802.94s)]
*  It's the same problem the Lakers have and the Warriors have where the league has [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2805.2599999999998s)]
*  gotten so young and athletic and just these, when you look at like the Knicks [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2808.9s)]
*  and OKC and the Celtics and it's like, how do you compete with that? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2815.02s)]
*  And it's, if you don't have like wings and athleticism in that way, that's [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2818.8199999999997s)]
*  what's going to sink the Lakers. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2823.22s)]
*  Ultimately. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2824.3799999999997s)]
*  Like clay looks great on paper. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2824.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh cool. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2826.3399999999997s)]
*  We got clay. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2826.74s)]
*  But they're still going to have the same problem they had last year where they're [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2828.06s)]
*  going to have trouble defending basically anybody you pick like Tatum, Luca, Durant. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2830.46s)]
*  Like they're, they don't have anyone on the roster who's going to be able [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2837.94s)]
*  to handle those guys. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2840.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2841.94s)]
*  If I'm being honest, I'm like, go back to stars. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2842.06s)]
*  I'm a movie stars. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2844.7s)]
*  Well, he needs a day. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2846.46s)]
*  Ensemble casts. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2847.3s)]
*  Movie stars. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2848.7s)]
*  He needs the Dame like all time comeback season. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2849.54s)]
*  Like the, I went through a divorce last year. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2854.3s)]
*  I got traded. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2856.42s)]
*  I doc said on my podcast, how he wasn't in shape over the solar in the red [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2857.46s)]
*  shade because he was afraid he's going to get traded. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2862.1400000000003s)]
*  So you just have Dame now in Rocky four log cabin mode and those two [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2864.98s)]
*  guys just lighten it up. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2870.26s)]

*  Underrated at this point. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2879.1s)]
*  Where do you think they rank in the Eastern conference for betting odds right now? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G72v60s5p3U&t=2881.62s)]
