# Netanyahu says he held meetings with Trump and Vance on Gaza hostages and Iran
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3A60p7ty8)
*  I had another meeting with President Trump on Wednesday, after a short meeting with Vice President Vance. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3A60p7ty8&t=0.0s)]
*  We focused on efforts to free our territories. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3A60p7ty8&t=6.0s)]
*  We are not taking a moment away from this, and it is possible because of the military pressure that our soldiers and soldiers exert. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3A60p7ty8&t=10.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, this effort is worth a painful price, which will benefit our homes. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3A60p7ty8&t=17.0s)]
*  But we are determined to achieve all our goals. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3A60p7ty8&t=24.0s)]
*  Let all our forces, life and space, be one. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3A60p7ty8&t=27.0s)]
*  Let's ensure Hamas' military and government capabilities. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3A60p7ty8&t=31.0s)]
*  And let's make sure that Gaza will not cause more violence against Israel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3A60p7ty8&t=34.0s)]
*  We also discussed the principles and opportunities of the great victory we achieved in Iran. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3A60p7ty8&t=39.0s)]
*  We opened opportunities for the opening of the Peace Council, the opening of the Avar Agenda. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3A60p7ty8&t=45.0s)]
*  We are working on this in the country's core. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3A60p7ty8&t=51.0s)]
*  I also gave President Trump the appreciation of all of you, the citizens of Israel, for your support, for the significant action he took, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3A60p7ty8&t=53.0s)]
*  and for the joint effort we are making today to bring a great future to the Middle East and a great future to the State of Israel. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu3A60p7ty8&t=62.0s)]
