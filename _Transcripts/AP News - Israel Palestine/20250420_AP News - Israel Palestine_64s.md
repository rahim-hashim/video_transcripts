# Israeli probe into killings of 15 Gaza medics finds 'professional failures' | AP Explains
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA)
*  The Israeli military has wrapped up its investigation into the killings of 15 Palestinian medics [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip last month. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=5.16s)]
*  The army says it found professional failures by its troops who opened fire at a convoy [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  of ambulances. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=12.02s)]
*  It also has dismissed a deputy commander who it says provided inaccurate information to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=13.22s)]
*  investigators. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=18.44s)]
*  In its initial account, the army said that a convoy of vehicles had been acting suspiciously [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=19.92s)]
*  and moving without their lights on. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=25.74s)]
*  But cell phone video recovered from the scene found that the vehicles had emergency lights [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=27.619999999999997s)]
*  on and were moving slowly and deliberately and clearly marked. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=32.14s)]
*  The convoy came under fire for more than five minutes. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=36.58s)]
*  Now the Israeli army says it has launched dozens of investigations into possible wrongdoing, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=42.94s)]
*  alleged wrongdoing by its troops during the year and a half war in Gaza. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=47.9s)]
*  But rarely does it issue punishments. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=52.42s)]
*  The findings of this investigation will now be turned over to the army's top lawyer who [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=55.339999999999996s)]
*  will decide whether this should be a criminal prosecution. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDrGAOvFCA&t=59.58s)]
