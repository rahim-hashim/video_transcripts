# New Gaza aid plan and why many aid groups are against it | AP Explains
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk)
*  A U.S.-backed group is set to take over a distribution in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's what we know. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=4.72s)]
*  The group is called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=5.92s)]
*  It is supported by Israel, and it is run by former U.S. military as well as humanitarian [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=8.92s)]
*  officials. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=14.56s)]
*  The group is going to distribute food assistance in hubs in southern Gaza as well as in the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=15.64s)]
*  center of Gaza and hope to feed about a million Palestinians, they say, at the beginning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=21.32s)]
*  Then over time, it will expand the hubs that it has, including to the north of Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=27.64s)]
*  Now, aid groups say that this approach will not work for them, that it violates humanitarian [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=32.64s)]
*  principles because it is going to essentially force people to move to the assistance, causing [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=37.44s)]
*  forcible displacement. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=42.6s)]
*  There are a lot of questions swirling about how this group will operate as well as who [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=45.32s)]
*  is going to run it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  Their director, Jake Wood, just resigned days before they say that they are going to start [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=50.32s)]
*  working. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=54.96s)]
*  It is unclear who is going to fund this group. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=55.96s)]
*  The group has said that there is a EU country that has pledged $100 million, but it is unclear [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  who that country is. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=64.64s)]
*  So there are a lot of questions right now about how this is going to work, will it work, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=66.16s)]
*  and they say that they are just days away from beginning operations. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnA9_ZKUPk&t=70.96000000000001s)]
