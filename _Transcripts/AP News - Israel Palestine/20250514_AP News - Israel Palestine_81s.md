*  I believe we are interconnected, that the death and destruction in Russia and Ukraine [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9uCryV-0h0&t=22.0s)]
*  will flow to our shores, that the risk of nuclear engagement in Asia and the Middle East [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9uCryV-0h0&t=28.0s)]
*  or the Americas will send shock waves of devastation for generations to come. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9uCryV-0h0&t=35.0s)]

*  Even as we gather tonight, our teams are engaged in intensive diplomacy to secure a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9uCryV-0h0&t=57.0s)]
*  To protect all civilians, especially innocent women and children, and ensure the release of all hostages. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9uCryV-0h0&t=64.0s)]
*  This conflict is the key to wider stability in the region, from the West Bank to Yemen to Lebanon. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9uCryV-0h0&t=72.0s)]
*  And time is short. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9uCryV-0h0&t=80.0s)]
