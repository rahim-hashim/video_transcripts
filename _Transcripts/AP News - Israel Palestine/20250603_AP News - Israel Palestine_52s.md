*  There is no specialization this time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITB20wqXPE&t=0.0s)]
*  More than the need of the people who are here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITB20wqXPE&t=3.0s)]
*  In the place where there are five people, there are fifty people. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITB20wqXPE&t=5.0s)]
*  There is no water, no services, nothing. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITB20wqXPE&t=10.0s)]
*  The Jews who sold their land, we will not give them anything. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITB20wqXPE&t=18.0s)]
*  We will only go down. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITB20wqXPE&t=21.0s)]
*  God willing, this will be the last of the people. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITB20wqXPE&t=22.0s)]
*  May God stop the war against all the Christians. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITB20wqXPE&t=26.0s)]
*  We went to Zahar this time, to 14. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITB20wqXPE&t=33.0s)]
*  We went there, we know where we want to go. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITB20wqXPE&t=36.0s)]
*  We are in the place where we were. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITB20wqXPE&t=39.0s)]
*  Where we went, God will throw us, we will go and stay. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITB20wqXPE&t=43.0s)]
*  What do we want to do? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITB20wqXPE&t=46.0s)]
