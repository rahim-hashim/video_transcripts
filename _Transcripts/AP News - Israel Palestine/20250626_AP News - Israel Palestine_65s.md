# Displaced Palestinians reach US-run aid distribution sites only to get leftovers or nothing at all
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85oIViThBro)
*  I didn't take anything. I didn't take anything. I didn't take anything. I came here more than 10 days. I came here day and night. I didn't take anything. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85oIViThBro&t=0.0s)]
*  There is no money in the mountains. If someone brought money, this situation would be over. There is no money. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85oIViThBro&t=18.0s)]
*  How can I feed 8 people? All the food is left in the market. 40 or 50. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85oIViThBro&t=31.0s)]
*  I came to get help. Every day I come, they don't give me anything. Today they gave me flour, 2 macronas and 1 kg of rice. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85oIViThBro&t=36.0s)]
*  I am 8 years old. We live in shame. When I want to feed my children, I go out to get their food. I can't afford to get their food. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85oIViThBro&t=53.0s)]
*  We are not like them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85oIViThBro&t=63.0s)]
