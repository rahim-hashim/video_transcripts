Video Description: Shootings have erupted multiple times in the last week in the vicinity of new aid hubs where desperate Palestinians are being directed to collect food, including on June 1 and June 3. Witnesses have told the Associated Press that it is nearby Israeli troops that have opened fire, and more than 80 people have been killed according to Gaza hospital officials. Israel has said soldiers fired warning shots or, in some cases, have shot towards “suspects' approaching the troops in the areas nearby the aid centers.
