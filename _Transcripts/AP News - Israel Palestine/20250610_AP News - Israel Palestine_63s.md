# Greta Thunberg arrives in Paris after being deported from Israel
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgUdpaZdpQ)
*  Welcome, welcome. Can we have a word? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgUdpaZdpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  On international waters we were illegally attacked and kidnapped by Israel [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgUdpaZdpQ&t=4.0s)]
*  and taken against our will to Israel where we were detained [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgUdpaZdpQ&t=12.0s)]
*  and then some of us deported, some are still there. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgUdpaZdpQ&t=16.0s)]
*  There are very big uncertainties because it was quite chaotic and uncertain [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgUdpaZdpQ&t=20.0s)]
*  so I don't really know what's going on. I haven't had a phone for many days. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgUdpaZdpQ&t=27.0s)]
*  What were the conditions for you over the last few hours? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgUdpaZdpQ&t=31.0s)]
*  There were absolutely nothing compared to what people are going through in Palestine, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgUdpaZdpQ&t=34.0s)]
*  especially Gaza right now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgUdpaZdpQ&t=40.0s)]
*  This is yet another international violation of international rights [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgUdpaZdpQ&t=42.0s)]
*  adding to the list of countless of such, especially towards Palestinians, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgUdpaZdpQ&t=49.0s)]
*  violations that Israel are committing by blocking and preventing humanitarian aid [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgUdpaZdpQ&t=53.0s)]
*  from entering Gaza. That is illegal. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgUdpaZdpQ&t=58.0s)]
