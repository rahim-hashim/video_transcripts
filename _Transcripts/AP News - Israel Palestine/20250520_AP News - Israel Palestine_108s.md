**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ)
*  We know for a fact that there are babies who are in urgent life-saving need of these supplements [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=0.0s)]
*  that need to come in because their mothers are unable to feed them themselves and if [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=9.28s)]
*  they do not get those they will be in mortal danger. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=15.48s)]
*  This is what humanitarian officials warned of as Israel began allowing a trickle of food [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=22.12s)]
*  and medicine into the Gaza Strip following nearly three months of blockade. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=26.28s)]
*  Only five trucks have entered Gaza since Monday according to the UN, a fraction of the 600 [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=31.6s)]
*  that crossed daily during a ceasefire earlier this year. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=36.28s)]
*  UN agencies say the aid arriving now falls far short of what is needed. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=39.0s)]
*  The humanitarian crisis is the worst it's been in the 19 months since the war began. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=43.6s)]
*  Past experience has very clearly showed that the less aid you get in and the less there [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  is properly distributed in Gaza the more desperation rises. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=54.52s)]
*  Each day thousands gather at the few charity kitchens that remain, many go home empty handed. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  With aid running low most people depend on them but many are shutting down as they've [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=70.48s)]
*  run out of food. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=74.0s)]
*  Since the start of the war more than 9,000 children have been admitted or treated for [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=79.68s)]
*  acute malnutrition UNICEF has said. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=83.52s)]
*  The increase was dramatic in March with 3,600 cases or an 80% increase compared to the 2,000 [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=86.84s)]
*  children treated in February. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  Aid groups have accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=95.84s)]
*  Israel for its part insisted that the blockade was necessary to pressure Hamas into releasing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  the hostages it still holds. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBemVQ_kRQ&t=104.36s)]
