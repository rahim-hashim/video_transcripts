**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zP8wxj3Ug)
*  The Hymn of the Hymn to the Virgin [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zP8wxj3Ug&t=0.0s)]
*  After you realized that I was going to fight in Gaza, you told me how important I was to you and how you were afraid of family issues. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zP8wxj3Ug&t=8.0s)]
*  You just told me to protect myself and to keep my distance from the media and not to make a fuss. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zP8wxj3Ug&t=16.0s)]
*  You are the closest person to my heart. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zP8wxj3Ug&t=21.0s)]
*  I am reminded of our memories, when we tried to speak in English, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zP8wxj3Ug&t=23.0s)]
*  and the only thing I liked about you was that I always told you, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zP8wxj3Ug&t=27.0s)]
*  I am so proud of you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zP8wxj3Ug&t=31.0s)]
*  And you would laugh. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zP8wxj3Ug&t=34.0s)]
*  You promised me that we would study together to cook and prepare for the New Year. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zP8wxj3Ug&t=38.0s)]
*  You promised me so many things. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zP8wxj3Ug&t=43.0s)]
*  Ronald, today is the last day of hard times. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zP8wxj3Ug&t=46.0s)]
