**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM)
*  I see people in their homes, all in tents, all the streets are in tents, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=0.0s)]
*  people are laughing, where did they all go? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=11.02s)]
*  The south is laughing and the north is laughing, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=14.02s)]
*  and there is no one left, all the streets are in tents, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=18.02s)]
*  where do you go? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=22.02s)]
*  Here is a tent, here is a tent, and we are fighting each other [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=24.02s)]
*  and those who listen to what people say, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=26.02s)]
*  we are fighting each other because of the pressure of the tents, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=28.04s)]
*  every tent is far from the other. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=32.04s)]
*  We were three groups, Jews were sent to war, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=36.04s)]
*  we lived in tents, ate and drank, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=40.04s)]
*  and thank God, we are living in the streets, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=43.04s)]
*  people are watching us, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=46.04s)]
*  and we are in a situation where I go and make a mess of the world [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=48.04s)]
*  to get a glass of alcohol for my children, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=51.04s)]
*  and my children died of hunger. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4PDOSneJM&t=53.04s)]
