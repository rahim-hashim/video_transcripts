Video Description: A group of diplomats came under fire while visiting Jenin, a city in the Israel-occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Authority. The Israeli military said the visit had been approved, but the delegation "deviated from the approved route" and Israeli soldiers fired warning shots to distance them from the area. The military apologized for the incident and said they will contact all of the relevant countries involved in the visit.
