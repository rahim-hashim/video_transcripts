*  a tough new reminder that the war in Gaza continues to grind on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_z_AXpmsY&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Israelis woke to the news that seven soldiers were killed in an explosion in the southern [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_z_AXpmsY&t=9.08s)]
*  Gaza Strip. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_z_AXpmsY&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  This was the deadliest single incident for the army in months. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_z_AXpmsY&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  At the same time, Palestinians have been reporting dozens of people being killed each day as [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_z_AXpmsY&t=18.2s)]
*  they try to collect food in Gaza. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_z_AXpmsY&t=24.12s)]
*  They say the Israeli army is opening fire at crowds of people. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_z_AXpmsY&t=25.88s)]
*  The army says it only opens fire when it sees people acting suspiciously, but that death [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_z_AXpmsY&t=29.88s)]
*  toll continues to grow each day. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_z_AXpmsY&t=34.44s)]
*  Now President Donald Trump played a key role in forging this ceasefire between Israel [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_z_AXpmsY&t=37.6s)]
*  and Iran. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_z_AXpmsY&t=42.2s)]
*  And now there are hopes in Israel, especially among families of hostages still held in Gaza, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_z_AXpmsY&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  and across Gaza, that Trump can use that same magic, that he can use his influence to forge [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_z_AXpmsY&t=49.68s)]
*  another ceasefire and bring an end to more than 20 months of fighting. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_z_AXpmsY&t=55.44s)]
