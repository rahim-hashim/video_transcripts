# Trump repeats proposal to make Gaza a 'freedom zone'
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE)
*  Well, we're working very hard on Gaza, and Gaza's been a territory of death and destruction. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE&t=0.0s)]
*  If the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone, have a real freedom [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE&t=8.76s)]
*  zone, put people in homes where they can be safe, and Hamas is going to have to be dealt [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  with. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  You've got to remember October 7th was one of the worst days in the history of the world, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  I think, not just local to this region. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE&t=25.76s)]
*  It was one of the worst, most atrocious attacks anyone's ever seen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE&t=29.96s)]
*  But now we're dealing with Hamas, and we're dealing with Iran, and we're dealing with [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE&t=36.04s)]
*  a lot of other things. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE&t=40.56s)]
*  We're dealing with the Houthis, and that was, I think, very successful. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE&t=41.56s)]
*  But maybe tomorrow an attack will be made, in which case we go back on the offensive. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE&t=45.88s)]
*  So it's good. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE&t=51.64s)]
*  It's good. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE&t=52.64s)]
*  There's a lot of things happening, a lot of very positive things happening. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMPNY1QnE&t=53.64s)]
