*  What are you doing? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=0.0s)]
*  We are living in the biggest tragedy in Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=6.0s)]
*  No one cares about us. Even when they say they are eating and drinking, we are not. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=9.0s)]
*  We are like the street people, we pick up food from the trash. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=15.0s)]
*  I swear, we live every day, we pick up food from the trash. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=18.0s)]
*  If we don't pick it up, we don't eat. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=21.0s)]
*  Even the bread, we pick it up and it is left in the trash. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=24.0s)]
*  We are like the street people, we pick up food from the trash. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=29.0s)]
*  What more can we say? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=32.0s)]
*  This is the difficult reality we are living in. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=34.0s)]
*  The person who is lying to you is a teacher. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=38.0s)]
*  Even though they pick up food from the trash. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=41.0s)]
*  Because I didn't eat, I don't eat. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=44.0s)]
*  This is the truth. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=47.0s)]
*  We are seven people, one is sick, one is sick of war. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=49.0s)]
*  We don't go out, we don't go out, we don't work. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=51.0s)]
*  Even the clothes we don't wear, we don't wear them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=53.0s)]
*  I go to my children to eat from the trash. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=56.0s)]
*  I boil it and eat it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=59.0s)]
*  I say the trash is better. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=61.0s)]
*  The street people miss us. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=63.0s)]
*  We are the most sad people. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM9YTon0R4&t=65.0s)]
