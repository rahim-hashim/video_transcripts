# Israel outlines plans to pack Gaza's population into a closed border zone
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk)
*  Israeli officials say they are moving closer toward a ceasefire deal that would pause the 21-month war in the Gaza Strip against Hamas militants. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk&t=0.0s)]
*  The officials say that 80 to 90 percent of the work is now done. They're hopeful a deal can be reached in the coming days. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk&t=8.0s)]
*  This, of course, does not guarantee success. We have seen repeated ceasefire efforts collapse, but conditions do appear to be ripe for a deal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk&t=15.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was at the White House to discuss the matter. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk&t=25.0s)]
*  Although there were no reports of breakthroughs, President Donald Trump has made it clear he wants to see this war end. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk&t=30.0s)]
*  Netanyahu is staying in Washington this week to continue these efforts. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk&t=36.0s)]
*  At the same time, Trump has dispatched his Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the Mideast country of Qatar, where the talks are taking place. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk&t=41.0s)]
*  They are hopeful that Witkoff can push a deal over the finish line. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk&t=50.0s)]
*  In the meantime, fighting is continuing in Gaza. The Israeli military reported the deaths of five soldiers in an attack in the northern Gaza Strip. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk&t=54.0s)]
*  Palestinian health officials say over 50 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk&t=62.0s)]
*  Now, at the same time, Israeli leaders have begun to talk about their postwar vision for Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk&t=68.0s)]
*  Israeli Defense Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told local correspondents that he wants to create what he calls a humanitarian city along Gaza's southern border with Egypt. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk&t=74.0s)]
*  The idea is to move the entire population there, but he has made it clear that he wants this to be a step toward encouraging Palestinians to leave Gaza altogether. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk&t=84.0s)]
*  This, of course, is a very controversial plan. It faces stiff international opposition, and it is far from clear whether Israel will be able to move forward with this plan. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwpZwVTqjk&t=95.0s)]
