# Palestinians react as Gaza officials say Israel killed 27 near aid site
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs)
*  They leave them in a place that is about 15 to 20 jillims. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=0.0s)]
*  They throw away the stuff that is in it, and the stuff that is in it is not enough for about 2000 people. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=16.0s)]
*  And what is left here is 10,000 people. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=22.0s)]
*  And two thirds of them were killed and three others were killed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=25.0s)]
*  We died 500 times per hour. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=28.0s)]
*  There are witnesses who were thrown into the same place. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=30.0s)]
*  And two thirds of them were killed and were not brought back. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=33.0s)]
*  When we arrived here, there was a blast from above. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=42.0s)]
*  I swear we were about to fall between the guys. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=44.0s)]
*  When it was 5 o'clock, I raised my head and saw the guys in the car. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=46.0s)]
*  I said, why are these witnesses thrown into the water? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=50.0s)]
*  They were thrown into the water. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=52.0s)]
*  They were thrown into the water. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=53.0s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=55.0s)]
*  If they were thrown into the water, we would have been in distress, in despair, and in hunger. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=56.0s)]
*  We've seen hundreds of presentations, dozens of casualties, martyrs. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=62.0s)]
*  These are civilians who went to get, again, for the third day in a row, civilians that went to get something to eat and they were attacked. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=69.0s)]
*  We've seen gunshots to the head and the chest, as I said before. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=77.0s)]
*  My message to the world is that these people need help. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=81.0s)]
*  This needs to stop. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=84.0s)]
*  It's not a political message. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=85.0s)]
*  It's a humanitarian message. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=86.0s)]
*  They need food. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=87.0s)]
*  They need aid. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=88.0s)]
*  They deserve their right to live. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0Xkev37Fs&t=89.0s)]
