# Netanyahu outlines conditions to end war in Gaza, wants to impose 'sterile zone'
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk)
*  I am willing to end the war with clear conditions that will ensure the security of Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=0.0s)]
*  All the fighters are returning home. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=6.0s)]
*  Hamas is taking over his position, leaving the government. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=8.0s)]
*  His leadership is distracted from the operation, that is, those who will remain. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=11.0s)]
*  Gaza is completely armed and we are implementing the Trump program, a program that is so correct and so objective. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=15.0s)]
*  He says something simple. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=26.0s)]
*  The residents of Gaza who want to leave will leave. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=28.0s)]
*  Anyone who calls on us to stop the war before these goals are met, actually calls on leaving Hamas in the government. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=31.0s)]
*  Therefore, in order to prevent Hamas from controlling humanitarian aid, we have developed together with the United States a different program, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=39.0s)]
*  a program to distribute basic food to citizens and children who will not arrive in Hamas. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=49.0s)]
*  This is divided into three phases. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=55.0s)]
*  Phase A, the introduction of a basic food supply to Gaza now in order to build a humanitarian crisis and to enable the continuation of the war. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=58.0s)]
*  Phase B, and this will happen in the coming days, the opening of points for the distribution of food through American companies that will be opened by the IDF. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=69.0s)]
*  Phase C, while the control of the Gaza Strip will create a sterile area in the south of the Strip, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=79.0s)]
*  where the civilian population will be deported from the battlefield for the sake of defense. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=87.0s)]
*  In this area, which will be clean from Hamas, the residents of Gaza will receive the full humanitarian aid. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKGeGbdVbk&t=92.0s)]
