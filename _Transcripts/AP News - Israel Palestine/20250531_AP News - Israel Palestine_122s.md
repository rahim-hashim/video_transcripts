# Gaza music teacher helps displaced children learn to play instruments
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs)
*  In Khan Younis, I make a group called Gaza Bird Singing, GPS. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs&t=0.0s)]
*  The group contains displaced kids from North Gaza. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs&t=26.64s)]
*  I'm just searching between the tents and I find a lot of kids that they have talent. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs&t=32.08s)]
*  They can sing good and play guitar now, right now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs&t=38.64s)]
*  I have another five colleagues teaching with me instruments. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs&t=44.88s)]
*  So we try our best to spread joy and love for music despite this situation. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs&t=53.0s)]
*  I've traveled more than once, from the house of Hanon to the mountains, to Nasir, to Gaza, to the south. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs&t=59.56s)]
*  We arrived to the south and they said the war is over. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs&t=80.92s)]
*  We went and settled down after we lived. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs&t=85.08s)]
*  We were in peace in our country. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs&t=89.08s)]
*  We went back and forth several times. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs&t=93.08s)]
*  Every time we go back, I feel scared and my heart keeps beating. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs&t=97.08s)]
*  Every time I feel scared, I go to this music shop. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs&t=101.08s)]
*  We want to get over this and go back to our country. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkzQM6e8qEs&t=105.08s)]
