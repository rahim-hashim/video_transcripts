# Trump says 3 hostages held by Hamas have died, leaving 21 believed to be alive
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM)
*  Thank you. On Gaza, you said there's been progress and progress in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=0.0s)]
*  But at the moment, as a colleague said, Israel, Netanyahu is saying he now wants to conquer Gaza. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=4.32s)]
*  Is there any prospect of any movement on that? Are you happy with what Netanyahu is doing? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=10.32s)]
*  Well, we've gone very slowly because we want to try and get as many hostages saved as possible. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=13.6s)]
*  And we've done a good job in that regard. Two weeks ago, I had 10 hostages come in, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=19.6s)]
*  and they thanked me profusely. And I said, You have nothing to thank me about. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=24.8s)]
*  They went through is incredible. They lived in a pipe. You know, they keep hearing about caves. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=28.96s)]
*  It was a pipe three and a half feet high. And they didn't know if they were going to breathe. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=33.6s)]
*  They didn't know if they were going to live to the next day. They lived like hell. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=38.4s)]
*  I couldn't believe the stories I was hearing. And they weren't grandstanding. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=40.96s)]
*  These were people that were seriously mistreated. I said, How many people are left? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=44.96s)]
*  How many are left? They said 59. I said, Oh, wow, that's more than I thought. They said, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=49.2s)]
*  Well, only 24 are living. But now it's 21. That was a week ago. Now it's 21 are living. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=55.84s)]
*  And these are young people. These young people don't die. Old people die. Young people don't [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=61.28s)]
*  die under these conditions. So of the 59 people, and they said 59. And I said, Really? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=66.48s)]
*  But they said only 24 are living. And I now correct I say 21 because as of today, it's 21. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=74.48s)]
*  Three have died. So this is a terrible situation. We're trying to get the hostages out. We've [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=82.72s)]
*  gotten a lot of them out. As the expression goes, there's 21 plus a lot of dead bodies. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgZZt6rOoM&t=89.52s)]
