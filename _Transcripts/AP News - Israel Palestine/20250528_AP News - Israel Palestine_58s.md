*  600 days of torture, 600 days of pain, 600 days of suffering, 600 days of tears, no sleep, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnRq76t9cU0&t=0.0s)]
*  the tears are in the eyes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnRq76t9cU0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  How long will this torture last? How long? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnRq76t9cU0&t=8.0s)]

*  our families, our homes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnRq76t9cU0&t=44.4s)]
