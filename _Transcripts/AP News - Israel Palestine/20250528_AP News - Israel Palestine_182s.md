# Palestinian ambassador gets emotional talking about children deaths in Gaza
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4)
*  Mr. President, since Israel broke the ceasefire in March, over 1,300 Palestinian children [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=0.0s)]
*  have been killed and around 4,000 have been injured. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=17.0s)]
*  These are children. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  Children. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  And still a war against barbarism. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  Children. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=33.8s)]
*  Dozens of children are dying of starvation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=40.8s)]
*  The images of mothers embracing their motionless bodies, caressing their hair, talking to them, apologizing to them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=48.699999999999996s)]
*  It's unbearable. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=67.7s)]
*  How could anyone? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=69.7s)]
*  To me, this is horrible. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  Excuse me, Mr. President. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  I have grandchildren. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  I know what they mean to their families. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  And to see the situation of the Palestinians without us having hearts to do something [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  is beyond the ability of any normal human being to tolerate. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=98.5s)]
*  Flames and hunger are devouring Palestinian children. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=106.5s)]
*  This is why we are so outraged as Palestinians everywhere, the 14 millions of us, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=112.5s)]
*  in the occupied territories, in the diaspora, in the refugee camps, in far places, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=119.5s)]
*  all the way to California and in between. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=126.4s)]
*  We love our children. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=130.4s)]
*  We love our people. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=132.4s)]
*  We don't want to see them going through this tragedy and this savage attacks [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=134.4s)]
*  by those who claim the virtues of fighting against barbarism. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=144.4s)]
*  Nothing can justify attacking civilians, whether Palestinians or Israelis. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=151.3s)]
*  Double standards no more. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=159.3s)]
*  We are human beings. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=162.3s)]
*  We are proud Palestinians. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=164.3s)]
*  We sit around this table. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=166.3s)]
*  We should be treated exactly like everybody else. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=168.3s)]
*  Not to see what you want to see in the mirror and to ignore the obvious, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  the huge elephant in the room, the Palestinian people. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-bUth_85F4&t=178.20000000000002s)]
