# Trump says a ceasefire in Gaza and nuclear deal with Iran are 'close'
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww)
*  Can you give us an update to the latest ceasefire agreement that Israel has agreed to, but Hamas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=0.0s)]
*  still considering? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=5.22s)]
*  Well, they're very close to an agreement on Gaza, and we'll let you know about it during [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=6.22s)]
*  the day or maybe tomorrow. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=11.24s)]
*  And we have a chance of that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=12.64s)]
*  I think we have a chance of making a deal with Iran also. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=13.92s)]
*  They don't want to be blown up. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=16.62s)]
*  They would rather make a deal. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=18.12s)]
*  And I think that could happen in the not-too-distant future. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=19.96s)]
*  That would be a great thing. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  If we could have a deal without bombs being dropped all over the Middle East, that would [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  be a very good thing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=29.2s)]
*  They can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=30.64s)]
*  We want them to be safe. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=33.64s)]
*  We want them to have a very, very successful nation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=34.8s)]
*  Let it be a great nation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=38.16s)]
*  But we can't have that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=39.16s)]
*  They cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=40.16s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  And I think we're fairly close to a deal with Iran. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MI5c444Zww&t=42.480000000000004s)]
