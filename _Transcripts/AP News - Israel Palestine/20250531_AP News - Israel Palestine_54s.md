*  We are so tired, we are starving, no one is looking for us, no Arabs are looking for us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa9LFMZEee8&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank God, we hope that this war will end. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa9LFMZEee8&t=7.0s)]
*  We want to stop in the bloodshed, we don't need help from anyone. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa9LFMZEee8&t=12.0s)]
*  We plant and eat on our own, and we take care of ourselves. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa9LFMZEee8&t=17.0s)]
*  We hope that God will stop the bloodshed that is happening in Gaza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa9LFMZEee8&t=21.0s)]
*  The bloodshed that is happening in Gaza, the massacres that are happening every day. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa9LFMZEee8&t=26.0s)]
*  We are so tired, I swear we are so tired. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa9LFMZEee8&t=31.0s)]
*  The main demand of every Palestinian, young or old, is to stop the war and to calm down. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa9LFMZEee8&t=36.0s)]
*  So that people can receive the aid in the right way. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa9LFMZEee8&t=44.0s)]
