*  There is no such food. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYSMf4-lIos&t=24.0s)]
*  The stores are closed. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYSMf4-lIos&t=26.0s)]
*  The food is expensive. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYSMf4-lIos&t=28.0s)]
*  I can't buy it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYSMf4-lIos&t=30.0s)]
