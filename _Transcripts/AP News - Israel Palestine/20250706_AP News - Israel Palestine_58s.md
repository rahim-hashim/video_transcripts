*  We are working on the conditions that were proposed, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXt7AJ6kmFw&t=3.0s)]

*  the sound of bombing. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXt7AJ6kmFw&t=17.0s)]
*  We do not believe that this will end. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXt7AJ6kmFw&t=19.0s)]
