**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4)
*  I call upon you, Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Trump, to do what needs to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=0.0s)]
*  done. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=10.44s)]
*  And you both can do it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=11.44s)]
*  Bring all of the hostages back and end the war. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=13.98s)]
*  We have hope from hearing Trump stop the war in Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=17.32s)]
*  And we know that if the war will stop, all the hostages will come back. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=23.0s)]
*  This is our hope. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=29.88s)]
*  We have a window of chance to end this nightmare and to bring our boys and precious ones to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  our families back. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=42.4s)]
*  Can't leave them behind. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=44.76s)]
*  They're all sick and unhealthy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  And we really worry about Rome because he has asthma and allergies. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=50.68s)]
*  And we really miss him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=55.16s)]
*  This deal has to happen now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=58.0s)]
*  Bring all of them back. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpcWGREu_I4&t=60.72s)]
