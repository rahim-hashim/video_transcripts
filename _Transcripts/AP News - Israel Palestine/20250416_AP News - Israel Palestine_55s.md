Video Description: Israel’s defense minister said Wednesday that troops will remain in so-called security zones in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria indefinitely, remarks that could further complicate talks with Hamas over a ceasefire and hostage release. Israel says it must maintain control of what it refers to as security zones to prevent a repeat of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. The Palestinians and both neighboring countries view the presence of Israeli troops as military occupation in violation of international law.

*  Israel's Defense Minister says that Israeli troops will remain indefinitely in self-declared security zones inside the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0suRr1_3z0&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli troops have been in these areas for months and Israel describes its ongoing presence as a security measure. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0suRr1_3z0&t=10.0s)]
