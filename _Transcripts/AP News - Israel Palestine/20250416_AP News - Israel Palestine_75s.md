# Displaced Palestinians told to leave shelters in West Bank
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4)
*  I'm standing in a youth sports center in Tulkarim in the West Bank where about 60 people are sheltering here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=0.0s)]
*  After Israel launched a widespread crackdown on West Bank militants at the end of January, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=6.0s)]
*  what Palestinians say was the largest displacement in decades, displacing tens of thousands of people. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=11.0s)]
*  But now people in this center as well as these other community schools and collective centers [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=18.0s)]
*  say that they need to start thinking about leaving. Some people have already been kicked out. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=23.0s)]
*  Wedding season has started. People have been in wedding venues. They've been told to leave. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=28.0s)]
*  People in this youth center say they've been told to start thinking about where to go next. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=32.0s)]
*  But Palestinians say that they have nowhere to go. A lot of them don't have money. They can't afford rent. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=37.0s)]
*  The aid groups say that they are strapped and struggling to help people. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=43.0s)]
*  The government says it does not have the resources and people are worried that this is going to go on for the long run [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=47.0s)]
*  and they're unsure on what the solution is. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=53.0s)]
*  Plans are in the works to create some mobile structures for people to live in, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=55.0s)]
*  but it's unclear when that will begin and even when it does begin it can only house several thousand people if that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=60.0s)]
*  Some people that I've spoken to have said that they have absolutely no idea where they're going to go if they are kicked out [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=67.0s)]
*  and that they might just have to sleep on the street. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbIG7ILUi4&t=72.0s)]
