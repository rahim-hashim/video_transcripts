# Trump says Greta Thunberg should take an 'anger management class'
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4)
*  The Press. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. President, how did your phone call go with Prime Minister Netanyahu? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=1.0s)]
*  You just mentioned Iran. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=3.44s)]
*  Did you discuss Iran? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=5.0s)]
*  Did you discuss the Gaza war? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=6.0s)]
*  The President. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=7.0s)]
*  Very well. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=8.0s)]
*  We discussed a lot of things. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=9.0s)]
*  Yeah, we discussed a lot of things, and it went very well. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=10.0s)]
*  Very smooth. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=12.96s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=13.96s)]
*  You know, we're trying to do something with a country we just spoke about, Iran. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=14.96s)]
*  I think you should negotiate this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=20.84s)]
*  You might be better. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=22.32s)]
*  I think I'm going to send you today. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=23.32s)]
*  What a good idea. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=24.76s)]
*  This could have been the idea of the day. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=25.76s)]
*  We'll have Dara get up and negotiate. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  They are good negotiators, but they're tough. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=29.84s)]
*  Sometimes they can be too tough. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=32.24s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=33.24s)]
*  I think we have the right person to do it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=34.24s)]
*  So we're trying to make a deal so that there's no destruction and death. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=35.24s)]
*  And we've told them that, and I've told them that, and I hope that's the way it works [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=41.96s)]
*  out. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=45.28s)]
*  But it might not work out that way. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=46.28s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=47.28s)]
*  Mr. President, do you have a message for Greta Thunberg? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=48.28s)]
*  And did she come up on your call with the Prime Minister today? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=50.8s)]
*  Well, she's a strange person. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  She's a young, angry person. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=54.84s)]
*  I don't know if it's real anger. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=55.84s)]
*  It's hard to believe, actually, but I saw what happened. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=57.32s)]
*  She's certainly different. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=62.44s)]
*  Do you think she's anger management? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=63.44s)]
*  I think she has to go to an anger management class. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=65.36s)]
*  That's my primary recommendation for her. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=69.4s)]
*  Was she kidnapped by Israel, as she says? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=71.36s)]
*  Was she kidnapped? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=74.6s)]
*  I find it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=75.6s)]
*  I think Israel has enough problems without kidnapping Greta Thunberg. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=76.6s)]
*  And secondly, are you going to get... [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=81.72s)]
*  Is that what she said? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=82.72s)]
*  She was kidnapped by Israel? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=83.72s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEq4CEd_ZT4&t=84.72s)]
