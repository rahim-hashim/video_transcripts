**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk)
*  The water is so hot that no one can stand it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=0.0s)]
*  The heat and the heat inside the tents, and the water is running out. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=9.0s)]
*  The water is running out. My children and my husband are standing on the water. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=13.0s)]
*  The water is running out. We have to fill two or three tanks with water. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=17.0s)]
*  We have to go and buy more. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=24.0s)]
*  I hope that this will be a calm. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=26.0s)]
*  Not a calm, but they will laugh at us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=29.0s)]
*  They will start to do the same things they did before. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=32.0s)]
*  No, we want a complete ceasefire. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=35.0s)]
*  They will not come back to the Jews. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=38.0s)]
*  The world will open up, and the food will be delivered to the people. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=41.0s)]
*  We will eat and drink like before. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=45.0s)]
*  They will not laugh at us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=48.0s)]
*  We want a calm, continuous. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=51.0s)]
*  We want a complete ceasefire. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=53.0s)]
*  We are the people of Gaza. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=62.0s)]
*  We have been in this situation for two years. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=65.0s)]
*  We expect a lot of people to be calm, but we are empty. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=68.0s)]
*  The problem of water is a big problem that many people suffer from. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=71.0s)]
*  We wait for the water to come every four days, every week. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=75.0s)]
*  I have children. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=79.0s)]
*  I told them that I have a problem with my neck. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=81.0s)]
*  I have many diseases. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaNFDPm2gk&t=84.0s)]
