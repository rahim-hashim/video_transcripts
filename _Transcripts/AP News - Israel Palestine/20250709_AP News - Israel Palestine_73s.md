Video Description: As Israel and Hamas move closer to a ceasefire agreement, Israel says it wants to maintain troops in a southern corridor of the Gaza Strip — a condition that could derail the talks. An Israeli official said an outstanding issue in the negotiations was Israel's desire to keep forces in the territory during a 60-day truce, including in the east-west axis that Israel calls the Morag corridor.

# Israel's insistence on keeping troops in Gaza complicates truce talks
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI)
*  As Israel and Hamas move closer to a ceasefire, the sides are feuding over planned Israeli [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=0.0s)]
*  redeployment in Gaza. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=9.36s)]
*  Israel is expected to withdraw some of the troops it has from positions in Gaza as part [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  of any deal, but it is resisting calls to leave an area known as the Morag Corridor. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=16.48s)]
*  This is a small stretch of land in southern Gaza, not too far from the Egyptian border. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  It's a small piece of land, but it holds great strategic value. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=27.54s)]
*  It's part of an Israeli plan to move all of Gaza's population, roughly 2 million people, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=31.46s)]
*  into a narrow strip of land along the Egyptian border. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=37.1s)]
*  It says this area will become a humanitarian city and that food and supplies and other [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=40.94s)]
*  resources will be available to the Palestinians there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=46.46s)]
*  But by maintaining control over this corridor, it also means that Palestinians will not be [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=49.7s)]
*  able to return further north. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  The Palestinians fear that this is part of a broader plan to leave them trapped in this [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=57.34s)]
*  narrow area and ultimately to force them to leave Gaza. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=62.24s)]
*  The mediators are working around the clock trying to resolve this issue, but so far, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=66.42s)]
*  no signs of a breakthrough. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlpDmLr2UGI&t=71.02000000000001s)]
