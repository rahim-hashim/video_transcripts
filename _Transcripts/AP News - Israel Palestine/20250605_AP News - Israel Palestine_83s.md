# 'What is happening in Gaza is a genocide,' Brazil's president says
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80)
*  What is happening in Gaza is not a war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=0.0s)]
*  What is happening in Gaza is a genocide of an army highly prepared against women and children. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=5.0s)]
*  That is what is happening. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=15.0s)]
*  And that is against that humanity has to be dignified. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=17.0s)]
*  That is against that society has to be dignified. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=22.0s)]
*  And that is against that I am being watched every day. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=25.0s)]
*  I am being a very annoying guy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=29.0s)]
*  I am being watched for changes in the UN Council. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=31.0s)]
*  Today's UN cannot be the UN of 45. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=35.0s)]
*  That is, everyone is interested in peace. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=38.0s)]
*  How is it not interested in the Ukrainian people? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=40.0s)]
*  How is it not interested in the suffering of Haiti? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=43.0s)]
*  That is, well, I am sorry for the emotion, but it is sad. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=47.0s)]
*  It is sad to know that the world is silent in the face of a genocide in which the great victim is not a soldier who is at war, but women and children. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=53.0s)]
*  That, sincerely, the day I lost the ability to dignify myself, I do not deserve to be a leader of my country. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=66.0s)]
*  That is why I am sorry. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=76.0s)]
*  Mr. President, we will come to the end of this press conference. Thank you all. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskFkCpbe80&t=78.0s)]
