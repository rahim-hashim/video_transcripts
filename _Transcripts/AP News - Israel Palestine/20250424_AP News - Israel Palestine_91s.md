**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPCWqKPymXg)
*  In the last eight and a half months, I've been in a tunnel, 20 or 30 meters underground. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPCWqKPymXg&t=0.0s)]
*  The tunnel itself is one meter wide, 12 meter long, about 1.8 meter high. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPCWqKPymXg&t=9.0s)]
*  And we've been there four men. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPCWqKPymXg&t=22.0s)]
*  Cruel terrorists just laughing around on kill people in the Novo Festival every day. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPCWqKPymXg&t=27.0s)]
*  And from time to time he will eat in front of us and just doing like, mmm, it's so tasty and things like that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPCWqKPymXg&t=35.0s)]
*  We needed just to bear with it because we knew that if we would say something, it would just beat us more. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPCWqKPymXg&t=47.0s)]
*  We only got one pita bread every 24 hours with two little spoons of cheese, of white cheese. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPCWqKPymXg&t=53.0s)]
*  It would be better to me just to accept their death, so I buried them in my mind. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPCWqKPymXg&t=65.0s)]
*  I went to the graveyard of our village and I imagined all the community, friends behind me and family. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPCWqKPymXg&t=73.0s)]
*  And I just buried them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPCWqKPymXg&t=85.0s)]
