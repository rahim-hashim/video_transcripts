# British surgeon working in Gaza says it is now 'a slaughterhouse'
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1jIM2iHhmc)
*  What can you say? I mean, it's horrific. Gaza has become a slaughterhouse. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1jIM2iHhmc&t=0.0s)]
*  Because of the blockade, there's so little stuff getting in. There's no food getting in so people are starving. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1jIM2iHhmc&t=15.0s)]
*  There's very little medical supplies coming in. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1jIM2iHhmc&t=21.0s)]
*  But also the other very noticeable thing is the massive extent of destruction. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1jIM2iHhmc&t=25.0s)]
*  I mean, Khan Yunus looks like Stalingrad. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1jIM2iHhmc&t=31.0s)]
*  So this is our living quarters. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1jIM2iHhmc&t=41.0s)]
*  All that's left. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1jIM2iHhmc&t=48.0s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1jIM2iHhmc&t=51.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1jIM2iHhmc&t=53.0s)]
*  It would be nice to see it before. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1jIM2iHhmc&t=54.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1jIM2iHhmc&t=56.0s)]
