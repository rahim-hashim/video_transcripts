# Trump says Israel accepted US proposal on 60-day ceasefire with Hamas
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE)
*  President Donald Trump says Israel has accepted a U.S. proposal for a 60-day ceasefire with Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=0.0s)]
*  This is raising hopes across the region that the sides may be moving closer toward ending this devastating 20-month war. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=7.0s)]
*  The proposal appears to follow a familiar formula. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=14.0s)]
*  The sides would halt fighting, and during the 60-day period, Hamas would release some of the hostages it's still holding, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=18.0s)]
*  while Israel would allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=24.0s)]
*  And during this time, they would open negotiations toward a permanent end to the war. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=28.0s)]
*  What makes the proposal different is the timing. Conditions appear to be ripening for a deal. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=34.0s)]
*  That's because of the recent war between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=40.0s)]
*  During this 12-day conflict, both Israel and the U.S. inflicted some heavy damage on Iran. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=43.0s)]
*  That has left both Iran and Hamas, its close ally, weaker and more isolated. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=49.0s)]
*  At the same time, Trump has made it clear to Israel that he wants to see an end to this war. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=55.0s)]
*  Now, this doesn't guarantee success. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already made some tough statements. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=60.0s)]
*  He says there is no place for Hamas in post-war Gaza. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=66.0s)]
*  Hamas, meanwhile, hasn't released its position on the proposal. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=70.0s)]
*  It says it's still studying and consulting with its partners on how to move forward. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=74.0s)]
*  The situation should become clearer in the coming days. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=79.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is expected at the White House early next week. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=83.0s)]
*  After he meets with Trump, we should have a clearer idea of where things are headed. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizZ0qnbQDE&t=88.0s)]
