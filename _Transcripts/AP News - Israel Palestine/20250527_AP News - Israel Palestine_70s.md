# Netanyahu says more aid distribution points to be set up in Gaza
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4P4Hk3tpg)
*  We worked out a plan with our American friends to have controlled distribution sites [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4P4Hk3tpg&t=0.0s)]
*  where an American company would distribute the food to Palestinian families. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4P4Hk3tpg&t=5.36s)]
*  It's not a truck with flower bags. It's a package for food for a family for a week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4P4Hk3tpg&t=11.76s)]
*  You come and you get it. Very hard for Hamas to steal it, especially because we guard these positions. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4P4Hk3tpg&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  We tried the first one. We're going to put many today. There was some loss of control momentarily. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4P4Hk3tpg&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  And happily we brought it back under control. We're going to put many more of these. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4P4Hk3tpg&t=28.8s)]
*  And the idea is basically to take away the humanitarian looting as a tool of war of Hamas [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4P4Hk3tpg&t=32.64s)]
*  to give it to the population, eventually to have a sterile zone in the south of Gaza [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4P4Hk3tpg&t=38.96s)]
*  where the entire population can move for its own protection. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4P4Hk3tpg&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  And then we basically, how shall I say this, we leave the fish without the water. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4P4Hk3tpg&t=47.44s)]
*  We leave the Hamas terrorists without the tool for governance which they use. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4P4Hk3tpg&t=55.92s)]
*  And that's basically the humanitarian aid that they loot. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4P4Hk3tpg&t=60.800000000000004s)]
