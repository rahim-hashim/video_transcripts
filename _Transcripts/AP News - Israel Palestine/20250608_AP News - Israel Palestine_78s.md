*  I'm sorry to hurt you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=0.0s)]
*  What's your problem? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=2.0s)]
*  They told us that there were helpers in the west of Rabah. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=8.0s)]
*  They told us to get down. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=10.0s)]
*  We went to the helpers, but they locked us inside. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=12.0s)]
*  The tanks came and took us inside. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=15.0s)]
*  We were beaten by the soldiers. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=18.0s)]
*  We don't know what to do. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=21.0s)]
*  We were shot and martyrs. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=23.0s)]
*  Some of the martyrs were thrown into the army. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=25.0s)]
*  We went to the helpers to get the children. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=29.0s)]
*  We were shot. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=32.0s)]
*  We were walking and they shot us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=34.0s)]
*  Where did you get the children? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=37.0s)]
*  We went to get them. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=39.0s)]
*  They put them in the cage to lock us inside. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=41.0s)]
*  They shot us. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=45.0s)]
*  Why did they send us to the helpers? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=47.0s)]
*  To beat us or to torture us? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=49.0s)]
*  We were arrested and we were left with nothing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=51.0s)]
*  Then I was dragged back. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=54.0s)]
*  There are other martyrs who are also in the army. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=56.0s)]
*  They told us to secure the area from 6 to 6. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=59.0s)]
*  Since it's secure from 6 to 6, why do they throw us in? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=61.0s)]
*  The light is on and they can see us. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=64.0s)]
*  They have cameras. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=66.0s)]
*  They want us to move forward. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=68.0s)]
*  They don't throw us in. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=70.0s)]
*  Why? Tell us why they are arresting us. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dubsDI1PY&t=72.0s)]
