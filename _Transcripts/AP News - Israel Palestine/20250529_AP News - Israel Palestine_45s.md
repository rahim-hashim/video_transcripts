**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0hRfIldkEo)
*  We heard that there are people who are screaming for their identity, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0hRfIldkEo&t=0.0s)]
*  but we didn't find any. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0hRfIldkEo&t=6.0s)]
*  We put the cameras on the ground and people started to attack us. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0hRfIldkEo&t=10.0s)]
*  We didn't go to the forest. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0hRfIldkEo&t=14.0s)]
*  We went to get food for the children, but we didn't get anything. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0hRfIldkEo&t=18.0s)]
*  We came here at 6 am today for a piece of bread. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0hRfIldkEo&t=25.0s)]
*  As they say, a piece of bread is a piece of bread that we eat and we are covered in blood. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0hRfIldkEo&t=29.0s)]
*  We came to take the food and we went to Shazia. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0hRfIldkEo&t=33.0s)]
*  I swear to God, there were rains between us and the people. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0hRfIldkEo&t=36.0s)]
*  We went to the martyrs' camp today, thank God. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0hRfIldkEo&t=39.0s)]
