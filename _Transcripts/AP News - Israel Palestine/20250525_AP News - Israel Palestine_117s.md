# Former world leaders call for tougher action against Israel to stop Gaza 'carnage'
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ)
*  The elders are slow to use the word genocide, but we are seeing significant evidence, this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  blocking for so long of access to food and then allowing a dribble of food. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=12.84s)]
*  And it's a dribble that's going in at the moment, nothing adequate. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=17.6s)]
*  And babies are dying, elderly people are dying, people are starving with hunger. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=21.92s)]
*  That's man created. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=26.96s)]
*  It is truly horrific and the bombardment, the constant killing that's going on. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=28.72s)]
*  So we believe that it's courts that determine, but as Juan Manuel said, we mustn't wait for [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=35.28s)]
*  that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=44.96s)]
*  We must stop possible genocide. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=45.96s)]
*  That's in the genocide convention. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=47.68s)]
*  It's just unconscionable that there has not been more attempt to stop the impunity, to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=49.92s)]
*  provide sanctions, to stop arming, to take some real steps which are now beginning. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=55.36s)]
*  The frustration we have is that the world watches and there's denunciations now coming [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=63.6s)]
*  from very powerful G7 countries, but nothing seems to stop the carnage. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=70.92s)]
*  President Trump has rightly chosen political dialogue over military action, for example, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=79.12s)]
*  on Iran. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=88.12s)]
*  But on Gaza, his Riviera Plan has emboldened Netanyahu, Netanyahu's government to pursue [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=90.48s)]
*  a dangerous end game. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  We urge President Trump to change course and suspend U.S. arms transfer to Israel now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=100.96s)]
*  I think that would help very much to push a solution. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRoYsw7nxQ&t=109.52s)]
