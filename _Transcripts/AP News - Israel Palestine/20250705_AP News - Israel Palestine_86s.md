**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [July 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70)
*  Bring them home now! Make that deal! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, as Americans across the country celebrate the Fourth of July, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=5.0s)]
*  a day that honors our freedom and founding ideals, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=11.0s)]
*  we, an American family with a loved one, my son Itai, still held hostage in Gaza, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=16.0s)]
*  cannot celebrate this Fourth of July again. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=26.0s)]
*  Instead, I appeal to President Trump to make my family whole again. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=30.0s)]
*  50 hostages are still in Hamas captivity. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=38.0s)]
*  Only a comprehensive deal can bring all of them home. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=42.0s)]
*  President Trump, you are the only one who can do it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=47.0s)]
*  End the war. Bring the hostages home. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=52.0s)]
*  Create a better future for the Middle East. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=56.0s)]
*  We are in an historic window of opportunity. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=59.0s)]
*  The leader who achieved a ceasefire with Iran can also deliver the deal of all deals in Gaza. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=62.0s)]
*  This is our moment. The families are waiting. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=71.0s)]
*  The 50 hostages are waiting. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=76.0s)]
*  Please, please don't let this opportunity slip away. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vbET6Dd70&t=79.0s)]
