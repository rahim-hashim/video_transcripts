Video Description: Surgeons at the Nasser Medical Hospital in Khan Younis spent Sunday operating around the clock on people injured when shooting erupted near an aid distribution hub in the Gaza Strip earlier in the day. 
At least 31 people were killed and over 170 were wounded Sunday as large crowds were on their way to receive food in the Gaza Strip, health officials and witnesses said. Witnesses said Israeli forces fired toward the crowds just before dawn around a kilometer (about 1,100 yards) from an aid site run by an Israeli-backed foundation. Israel’s military denied its forces fired at civilians near or within the site in the southern city of Rafah. (AP video by Mohammad Jahjouj/Produced by Wafaa Shurafa).

*  The types of cases are between the firing of the fire, which is the most common, and between the shooting of the bullets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jBTExNfFdQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Most of the firing took place in the upper part of the chest and chest area. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jBTExNfFdQ&t=7.0s)]
*  Until now, we have counted more than 30 cases of shooting, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jBTExNfFdQ&t=14.0s)]
*  including the cases of the surgery, the surgery of the wound and the various parts. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jBTExNfFdQ&t=20.0s)]
