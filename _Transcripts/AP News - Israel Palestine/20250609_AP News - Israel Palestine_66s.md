**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upK-iAow-x8)
*  France calls for a ceasefire as soon as possible and it has raised the humanitarian blockade. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upK-iAow-x8&t=0.0s)]
*  The scandal, the unacceptable that is happening in Gaza, is this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upK-iAow-x8&t=10.8s)]
*  And this is what has been a shame since the beginning of March. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upK-iAow-x8&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  A shame. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upK-iAow-x8&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  And so I have had again the President of the United States of America and the Emir of Qatar, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upK-iAow-x8&t=21.8s)]
*  who play an extremely important role in the negotiations on this subject. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upK-iAow-x8&t=27.4s)]
*  First of all, by thanking them for this commitment and saying that now we must finally get this ceasefire, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upK-iAow-x8&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  the liberation of the hostages and reopening humanitarian routes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upK-iAow-x8&t=38.6s)]
*  It is essential that the United Nations can do with their agencies, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upK-iAow-x8&t=43.4s)]
*  with the non-governmental organizations accredited in perfect transparency their work. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upK-iAow-x8&t=49.2s)]
*  We are talking about children, we are talking about people today in a very serious situation, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upK-iAow-x8&t=54.4s)]
*  we are talking about elderly people who are dying every day because of this blockade [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upK-iAow-x8&t=58.4s)]
*  and because the ceasefire is not signed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upK-iAow-x8&t=63.0s)]
