*  I don't know. How are you? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rVkkgdvabU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm from Brazil, from the global south. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rVkkgdvabU&t=4.0s)]
*  We are doing this because no matter what odds we are against, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rVkkgdvabU&t=7.0s)]
*  we have to keep trying. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rVkkgdvabU&t=11.0s)]
*  Because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rVkkgdvabU&t=14.0s)]
*  And no matter how dangerous this mission is, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rVkkgdvabU&t=18.0s)]
*  it is nowhere near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rVkkgdvabU&t=21.0s)]
*  in the face of a life-threatening genocide. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rVkkgdvabU&t=26.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rVkkgdvabU&t=30.0s)]
