# Israel claims Hamas leader is dead as Palestinians in Gaza grow desperate for food
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel has killed the top Hamas figure in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas isn't commenting on the claim, but if it's confirmed, the death of Mohammed Sinwar would mark the latest in a long list of top Hamas officials to be killed by Israel during the 19-month war. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4&t=6.0s)]
*  Mohammed Sinwar took over the leadership of Hamas in Gaza after his brother Yahya Sinwar was killed by Israel last October. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4&t=18.0s)]
*  Yahya Sinwar was one of the masterminds of the October 7th Hamas attacks that triggered this war. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4&t=26.0s)]
*  Israel had said that Mohammed Sinwar has taken a tough line in ongoing ceasefire talks. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4&t=32.0s)]
*  With the war now reaching 600 days, those negotiations still appear to be deadlocked. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4&t=38.0s)]
*  It's not clear whether Mohammed Sinwar is dead or how it will affect these negotiations. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4&t=44.0s)]
*  In the meantime, a new U.S.-backed initiative to deliver food to people in Gaza has gotten off to a rocky start. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4&t=51.0s)]
*  The Gaza Humanitarian Fund began operations on Tuesday. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4&t=58.0s)]
*  Thousands of people converged on one of its distribution points and gunfire erupted. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4&t=63.0s)]
*  Palestinian health officials say nearly 50 people were shot and one of them was killed. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4&t=69.0s)]
*  Now, it's not clear who fired the shots, and the Humanitarian Fund is playing down the incident. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4&t=74.0s)]
*  It says none of its workers opened fire. It says that its operations have resumed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4&t=80.0s)]
*  It is up and running, and it is planning on ramping up its distribution in the coming weeks. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZo3H2Iv7l4&t=85.0s)]
