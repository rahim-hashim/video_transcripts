# Trump and Netanyahu answer questions about Gaza during White House meeting
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc)
*  The Press. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. President, is your Palestinian relocation plan [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=1.0s)]
*  still on the table? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=3.36s)]
*  Is there a plan that there'll be any progress [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=4.66s)]
*  in finding a country to set up? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=7.4s)]
*  The President. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=8.64s)]
*  The President. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=9.4s)]
*  Yeah, maybe why don't I let you answer that question. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=10.1s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=11.4s)]
*  Wait, he's got to answer the question. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=12.64s)]
*  I think President Trump had a brilliant vision. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=14.38s)]
*  It's called free choice. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  You know, if people want to stay, they can stay. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  But if they want to leave, they should be able to leave. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=23.18s)]
*  It shouldn't be a, you know, prison. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=25.02s)]
*  It should be an open place. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=26.66s)]
*  And give people a free choice. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=29.04s)]
*  We're working with the United States very closely [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=31.1s)]
*  about finding countries that will seek to realize [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=35.04s)]
*  what they always say, that they want to give [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=38.92s)]
*  the Palestinians a better future. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  And those who, and I think we're getting close [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=43.28s)]
*  to finding several countries, and I think this will do. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  Again, the freedom to choose. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=51.16s)]
*  Palestinians should have it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=54.260000000000005s)]
*  And I hope that we can secure it close by. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=55.82s)]
*  A ceasefire between Israel and Moscow is currently going on. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=59.419999999999995s)]
*  I don't think there is a holdup. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=64.2s)]
*  I don't think there's a holdup. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=66.36s)]
*  I think things are going along very well. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=67.44s)]
*  They just, you know, left each other, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=71.94s)]
*  and it was not a pleasant period of a few days. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  It was a little longer than a few days, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=76.78s)]
*  but this was not a pleasant period of time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgL1qaGiNXc&t=78.28s)]
