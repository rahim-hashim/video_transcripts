*  I am forced to do this for my children. I don't eat anything that is not in the food. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8IWxLy6ks4&t=0.0s)]
*  I am forced to go out and eat a meal like this, and then I go out and eat a kilo of flour. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8IWxLy6ks4&t=16.0s)]
*  It is life. We can go out and eat two kilos, three kilos, four kilos, and then go out and eat a kilo of flour. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8IWxLy6ks4&t=21.0s)]
*  I hope that these points are closed because these are points of death. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8IWxLy6ks4&t=28.0s)]
*  If a pregnant woman or a pregnant woman or a pregnant woman comes, one of them will die. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8IWxLy6ks4&t=40.0s)]
*  In this way, all of them are dangerous and all of them are dead. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8IWxLy6ks4&t=45.0s)]
*  I hope that everyone will close these points and return to distributing to foreign institutions. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8IWxLy6ks4&t=48.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8IWxLy6ks4&t=58.0s)]
