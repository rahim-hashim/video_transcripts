# Hamas accepts draft agreement for Gaza ceasefire, release of hostages, officials say
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAjzI48agM)
*  Israel and Hamas appear to be on the cusp of a ceasefire deal that would end over 15 months of war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAjzI48agM&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas officials say they've accepted a draft of the proposal. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAjzI48agM&t=5.0s)]
*  The Israelis say there still is no deal, but they're also voicing optimism as final details are being worked out. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAjzI48agM&t=8.0s)]
*  Qatar, the Mideast country that's been mediating the talks, say the sides have not been this close to an agreement in months. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAjzI48agM&t=15.0s)]
*  The proposal lays out a multi-stage process for ending a war that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAjzI48agM&t=22.0s)]
*  1,600 Israelis, and also caused widespread devastation in Gaza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAjzI48agM&t=28.0s)]
*  The first stage calls for a gradual pullback of Israeli troops from most of Gaza over six weeks [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAjzI48agM&t=33.0s)]
*  in exchange for the freedom of 33 hostages held by Hamas. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAjzI48agM&t=39.0s)]
*  Displaced Palestinians would also begin to go home, and aid would pour into Gaza. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAjzI48agM&t=43.0s)]
*  The sides also would quickly enter negotiations on a second phase meant to end the war altogether. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAjzI48agM&t=48.0s)]
*  That would mean a final pullout of remaining Israeli troops and the return of roughly 70 other hostages. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAjzI48agM&t=55.0s)]
*  Now, it remains unclear who will run Gaza in the long run and who is going to pay for the badly needed reconstruction, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAjzI48agM&t=61.0s)]
*  but negotiators are hoping that this initial ceasefire, this initial phase, will create the momentum to address these deeper issues. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAjzI48agM&t=69.0s)]
