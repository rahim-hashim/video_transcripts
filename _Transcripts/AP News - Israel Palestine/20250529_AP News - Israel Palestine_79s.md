# Steve Witkoff is optimistic about brokering agreement to halt Israel-Hamas war
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE)
*  President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, says he is optimistic about Gaza's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=0.0s)]
*  ceasefire prospects. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=4.44s)]
*  Witkoff says he is working on a new proposal that he will give to Israel and Hamas, and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=5.84s)]
*  he has a good feeling that it will be acceptable to the warring sides. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  The proposal is expected to look familiar in many ways. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  It would begin with a partial release of some of the hostages held by Hamas in exchange [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=16.84s)]
*  for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=21.8s)]
*  It also would launch a longer term process of negotiations aimed at ending the war altogether. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=24.72s)]
*  What would set this apart from its predecessors is that it would include American guarantees [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=30.36s)]
*  that Israel will not resume its war. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=34.96s)]
*  If you remember, the last ceasefire broke down in March when Israel unilaterally withdrew [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  and resumed its military campaign in Gaza. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=43.72s)]
*  Israel hasn't commented on the latest proposal, so it's not yet clear whether Witkoff really [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  has found that magic formula. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=53.08s)]
*  In the meantime, Israel says it will build 22 new settlements in the occupied West Bank. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=54.8s)]
*  The international community opposes these settlements. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=61.04s)]
*  They are aimed at preventing the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=64.08s)]
*  However, President Trump historically has been sympathetic to the settlers. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=68.84s)]
*  That is allowing Israel to press forward with this initiative. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDtu-9mWDeE&t=74.32s)]
