# Israeli report accuses Hamas of using sexual violence as a weapon of war on Oct. 7
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUzVc8W224)
*  We formed an evidentiary framework that proves that Hamas used sexual violence in a systematic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUzVc8W224&t=0.0s)]
*  manner as a weapon of war. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUzVc8W224&t=11.24s)]
*  And we've also formed a legal theory that allows the prosecution of all those who took [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUzVc8W224&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  part in the attack. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUzVc8W224&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  And this understanding that we need to learn from past events, and the understanding that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUzVc8W224&t=25.4s)]
*  we as Israeli women must forget the anger of those who can no longer forget, and we [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUzVc8W224&t=31.4s)]
*  need to bring them justice. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUzVc8W224&t=39.4s)]
*  In Shevi I went through a period of hunger, hunger, sadness, loneliness, physical and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUzVc8W224&t=44.4s)]
*  mental suffering. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUzVc8W224&t=50.4s)]
*  My body was in pain, my limbs were broken. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUzVc8W224&t=51.4s)]
*  But the fear, the fear, the feeling that someone else's distance is the pain that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUzVc8W224&t=55.4s)]
*  does not leave. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUzVc8W224&t=62.4s)]
