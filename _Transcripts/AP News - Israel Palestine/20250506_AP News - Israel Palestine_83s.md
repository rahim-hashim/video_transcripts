# Israel approves operation to seize control of entire Gaza Strip
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0)
*  Israel said it is going to seize control of Gaza for an unspecified period of time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=0.0s)]
*  It is unclear what these plans entail or when they will begin, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=5.36s)]
*  but Israel is calling up hundreds of thousands of reserve soldiers [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=8.96s)]
*  and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that this is going to be a powerful operation. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=12.64s)]
*  Military analysts say that this could just be a pressure tactic to push Hamas to release the 59 [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=17.6s)]
*  hostages still held in Gaza and that Israel doesn't really want to control Gaza. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=23.6s)]
*  There are also political considerations. Netanyahu has a hard right coalition that does not want to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=28.56s)]
*  see the war end until it says it eliminates Hamas. These plans come as Israel has also said that it [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=34.72s)]
*  is going to start controlling aid distribution in Gaza. It's going to use the private military [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  companies. Aid groups say the plan is to force people to move from the north of Gaza to logistical [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  hubs in the south in order to receive aid and this is something that humanitarian say they will [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=53.44s)]
*  not participate in because they say the forcible displacement of people is a violation of international [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=58.4s)]
*  law. Now this comes as Israel's blockade in Gaza enters its third month. Nothing has gotten into [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  the strip. Aid groups are warning of starvation and they say that if this continues the situation [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=70.72s)]
*  is going to be even more catastrophic. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOBc0Iyfo0&t=75.84s)]
