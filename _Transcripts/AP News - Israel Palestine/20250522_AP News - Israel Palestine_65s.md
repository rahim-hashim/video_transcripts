# Israeli politician critiques the Gaza war’s toll on Palestinians and sparks an outcry
**AP News - Israel Palestine:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkQ8-VFB2K0)
*  I said this morning that we are a country that is not killing children. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkQ8-VFB2K0&t=0.0s)]
*  When ministers in this government celebrate the death and destruction of children, they must say it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkQ8-VFB2K0&t=8.0s)]
*  I have been concerned only with the government that is most difficult in the history of Israel, and not with the IDF. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkQ8-VFB2K0&t=15.0s)]
*  Our mission is to make sure that Israel remains a country that is not killing children, not as a threat and not as a policy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkQ8-VFB2K0&t=21.0s)]
*  If you want the opposition to be able to present an alternative to the coalition, it must be an alternative that is seen as patriotic to the majority of Israelis. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkQ8-VFB2K0&t=30.0s)]
*  This is a fight for our lives, for our security, for the security of our families. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkQ8-VFB2K0&t=42.0s)]
*  So, Israelis tend to see everyone beyond the Gaza border as enemy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkQ8-VFB2K0&t=48.0s)]
*  And when you fight a war of existence, you don't much think about the suffering of the enemy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkQ8-VFB2K0&t=54.0s)]
