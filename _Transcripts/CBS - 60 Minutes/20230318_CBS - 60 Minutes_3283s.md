# Killing cancer with a breakthrough therapy | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [March 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8)
*  The long war on cancer has left us well short of victory. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=0.0s)]
*  Radiation flashed on in the 19th century, chemotherapy began to drip in the 20th, but [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=19.0s)]
*  for so many, 100 years of research adds up to just a few more months of life. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=24.04s)]
*  Well, tonight, you're about to see a discovery for the 21st century that may be a big leap [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=30.04s)]
*  forward – awakening the power of the body's immune system. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=36.24s)]
*  For 10 months, we've been inside an experimental therapy at Duke University. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=41.0s)]
*  Some of the patients there use words that doctors don't use, like miracle and cure. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  And that's remarkable because these patients were handed a death sentence – a relentless [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=51.38s)]
*  brain cancer called glioblastoma. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=56.6s)]
*  To beat it, researchers are doing something that many thought was crazy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  They're infecting the tumors with polio – the virus that has crippled and killed [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=65.18s)]
*  for centuries. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=71.7s)]
*  In just a moment, polio will be dripped into the brain of 58-year-old Nancy Justice. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=74.04s)]
*  Her glioblastoma tumor was discovered in 2012. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=79.64s)]
*  Surgery, chemotherapy and radiation bought her two and a half years, but the tumor came [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=82.98s)]
*  roaring back. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=89.26s)]
*  Now, the virus in this syringe, which mankind has fought to eradicate from the earth, is [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=90.74s)]
*  the last chance she has in the world. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=97.34s)]
*  In October this past year, half a teaspoon of polio flowed into her tumor. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=102.1s)]
*  Okay, ready to go? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=108.2s)]
*  Are you ready to go? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=109.2s)]
*  I'm ready. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=110.2s)]
*  Break it on. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=111.2s)]
*  We're starting. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=112.2s)]
*  921. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=113.2s)]
*  If you feel anything, you'll let us know. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=114.2s)]
*  I will, definitely. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=116.0s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=117.0s)]
*  Well, let me ask, do you feel anything? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=118.0s)]
*  No. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=120.4s)]
*  So far, so good. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=121.4s)]
*  Don't feel a thing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=122.4s)]
*  Her husband, Greg, constantly inflates a buoyant optimism to save him from the weight of the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=124.92s)]
*  unknown. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=130.68s)]
*  Glioblastoma was diagnosed in the 21st year of the Georgia couple's marriage, just as [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=132.84s)]
*  they could make out the finish line for Zach and Luke at college. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=137.54s)]
*  Her tumor can double in size every two weeks, and when glioblastoma returns, time is short. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  Doctors gave her seven months, but good ones? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=149.86s)]
*  Maybe just three or four. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=153.22s)]
*  The tumor was aggressive. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=155.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=156.3s)]
*  So you wanted an aggressive treatment. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=157.3s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=158.3s)]
*  You're a medical explorer. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=159.52s)]
*  Does it feel that way to you? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=163.24s)]
*  I've taken it one day at a time. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=165.0s)]
*  It sounds very lofty to say medical explorer, but throughout all of this, if this gives [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=168.68s)]
*  other people hope, I'm all for it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=175.84s)]
*  Greg, you mentioned that Nancy was there for every important event in the boys' lives, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=178.4s)]
*  but there are a lot of important events to come. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=186.56s)]
*  What do you hope to see? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=187.56s)]
*  So I am going to see those boys walk across the stage at their college graduation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=188.88s)]
*  I am going to see them get married, and I am going to see them get kids, preferably [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=193.74s)]
*  in that order. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=198.1s)]
*  And I know it's like such a mom bucket list, but I'll love every minute of it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=200.54s)]
*  It was the day before that we saw Nancy proceeded by her shield, the smile that she rarely lets slip. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=206.1s)]
*  I'm ready. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=213.54s)]
*  Nancy was wheeling into an intricate surgery to insert a path for the virus. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=215.14s)]
*  That white mass is the tumor, back of her skull, near the top. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=220.22s)]
*  Duke's chief of neurosurgery, Dr. John Sampson, used 3D MRIs to plot his course. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  He tacked between the lime green strands that connect to every vital function in her body, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=231.94s)]
*  and he brought the catheter to the center of the lethal mass. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=237.64s)]
*  It's just like a sniper's bullet. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=241.01999999999998s)]
*  If it doesn't go to the right place, it's not going to hit the target. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=242.64s)]
*  And it's not only important to get it to the right place, but also to make sure that it [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=245.27999999999997s)]
*  doesn't go to the wrong places, doesn't cause any harm to the patient. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=248.2s)]
*  It doesn't travel throughout the brain. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=251.55999999999997s)]
*  It won't travel too far throughout the brain, because it's a relatively big molecule, and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=253.72s)]
*  the brain's a tight space, so it's limited in how far it can travel. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=257.08s)]
*  At least that's what they expected, as Nancy became the 17th patient in the experiment. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=260.64s)]
*  The polio infusion was slow. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=266.88s)]
*  That half a teaspoon took six and a half hours. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=268.94s)]
*  But that's it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=272.76s)]
*  One dose, and she's done. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=273.9s)]
*  No more surgery, chemo, radiation, nothing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=276.0s)]
*  If this works. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  You're doing fantastic. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  Now show me your smile. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  On Nancy's way home that same day, oncologist Dr. Annette Desjardins showed her how it went. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=284.44s)]
*  So we can exactly see where the polio virus went. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=291.08s)]
*  So that's the MRI you and I looked at on Monday. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=294.7s)]
*  Then you see here, the brighter area there, you can see. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=298.14s)]
*  That's the polio virus. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=303.53999999999996s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=305.42s)]
*  Exactly where we needed it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=306.42s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=308.46s)]
*  Right where it should be. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=309.58s)]
*  In a few months, they'll take another MRI to see which is stronger, glioblastoma or [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  polio. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=317.18s)]
*  This is Duke's polio team. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=319.86s)]
*  As usual in such studies, several of them have a financial stake, so they'll benefit [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=322.22s)]
*  too if it becomes commercial. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=326.90000000000003s)]
*  Can you pick out the deputy director of the Brain Tumor Center? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=329.46s)]
*  Well, when you're one of the world's leading cancer doctors, turns out you can wear what [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=333.06s)]
*  you like. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=337.46000000000004s)]
*  And after 34 years, folks at Duke are used to how Dr. Henry Friedman's brain views fashion. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=338.7s)]
*  It's really good to see that this is going well. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=344.86s)]
*  It was Friedman who encouraged Nancy Justice to gamble on the polio experiment. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=347.38s)]
*  I wonder, of all the trials and all of the theories and all of the treatments that you [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=352.46s)]
*  have hoped for all of these years, how does this stack up? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=359.34s)]
*  This to me is the most promising therapy I've seen in my career, period. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=364.62s)]
*  A turning point in cancer care? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=368.94s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=371.3s)]
*  I think it may well be. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=372.3s)]
*  Why would he say that during an early clinical trial with barely enough patients to fill [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=373.86s)]
*  an elevator? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=378.58000000000004s)]
*  Because of the decades of work that have led to this moment. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=380.5s)]
*  The virus is the creation of the obsession of Dr. Mathias Gromeyer, a molecular biologist [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=384.62s)]
*  who's been laboring over this therapy 25 years, the last 15 at Duke. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=392.26s)]
*  When you went to your colleagues and said, I've got it, we'll use the polio virus to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=398.18s)]
*  kill cancer, what did they say? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=402.42s)]
*  Well, I got a range of responses from crazy to you're lying, all kinds of things. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=405.5s)]
*  Most people thought it was just too dangerous. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=414.3s)]
*  I thought he was nuts. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=416.22s)]
*  I mean, I really thought that what he's using is a weapon that produces paralysis. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=417.22s)]
*  Other researchers are experimenting with cancer treatments using viruses including HIV, small [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  pox and measles. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=431.1s)]
*  But polio was Dr. Gromeyer's choice because as luck would have it, it seeks out and attaches [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=432.54s)]
*  to a receptor that is found on the surface of the cells that make up nearly every kind [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=439.38000000000005s)]
*  of solid tumor. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=445.42s)]
*  It's almost as if polio had evolved for the purpose. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=447.02000000000004s)]
*  Gromeyer re-engineered the polio virus by removing a key genetic sequence. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  The virus can't survive this way, so he repaired the damage with a harmless bit of cold virus. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=456.78s)]
*  This new modified virus can't cause paralysis or death because it can't reproduce in normal [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=463.34s)]
*  cells. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=470.14s)]
*  But in cancer cells, it does. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=471.14s)]
*  And in the process of replicating, it releases toxins that poison the cell. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=473.41999999999996s)]
*  Duke went to the FDA for approval of this new Frankenstein virus. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=478.53999999999996s)]
*  They were afraid you might create a monster. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=484.34s)]
*  They were afraid we might create something which could infect the general community. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=486.54s)]
*  I mean, look at me. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=491.22s)]
*  I'm a scientist, I'm a physician, and I said, this is nuts. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=492.38s)]
*  I think that their reaction was appropriate. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=495.78000000000003s)]
*  To satisfy the FDA, they did seven years of safety studies. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=499.54s)]
*  Tests on 39 monkeys proved they didn't get polio. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=504.34000000000003s)]
*  And in 2011, the FDA approved a trial in humans. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=508.26s)]
*  Someone had to go first. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=513.02s)]
*  It's a hell of a thing to be told that you have months to live when you're 20 years old. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=515.94s)]
*  In 2011, Stephanie Lipscomb was a nursing student with headaches. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=520.74s)]
*  A doctor came in to say that she had this glioblastoma tumor the size of a tennis ball. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=524.82s)]
*  I looked at the nurse that was sitting there holding my hand, and I said, I don't understand. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=531.46s)]
*  What did he just say? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=539.3000000000001s)]
*  It's kind of hard for me to process. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=541.94s)]
*  You had 98% of the tumor removed. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=544.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=546.46s)]
*  As much radiation as you can have in a lifetime. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=547.46s)]
*  And chemotherapy. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=550.98s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=551.98s)]
*  And then in 2012, what did the doctors tell you? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=552.98s)]
*  Your cancer's back. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=557.18s)]
*  With recurrent glioblastoma, there were no options except the one that had never been [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=559.18s)]
*  tried before. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=564.88s)]
*  Did they tell you that it had never been tried in a human being before? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=566.5799999999999s)]
*  They did. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=569.8199999999999s)]
*  But at the same time, I had nothing to lose, honestly. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=570.98s)]
*  I wonder what your mother said. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=576.1800000000001s)]
*  She looked at Dr. DeGerty and she said, you want to do what with my daughter? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=578.1400000000001s)]
*  You want to do what? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=584.58s)]
*  And I'm like, let's do it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=586.9000000000001s)]
*  Come on, let's go. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=587.9000000000001s)]
*  I have the sense that this scared you a lot more than you've let on. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=589.62s)]
*  It did. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=595.4200000000001s)]
*  I didn't know how scared my family was and I didn't want them to see me scared. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=596.42s)]
*  But of course you were. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=603.0999999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=604.0999999999999s)]
*  In point of fact, we didn't know what the polio was going to do. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=605.0999999999999s)]
*  We thought the polio virus might help her. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=608.66s)]
*  We had no idea what it would do in the long haul. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=610.4399999999999s)]
*  It was a crapshoot. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=613.26s)]
*  It's roll the dice and hope that you're going to get an answer that is coming up sevens [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=614.26s)]
*  and not coming up snake eyes. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=619.74s)]
*  But in the months that followed, it looked like a bad bet. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=621.78s)]
*  So we treated her in May. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=625.7800000000001s)]
*  Then in July, the tumor looked bigger, looked really inflamed. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=627.7800000000001s)]
*  I got really concerned, got really worried. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=632.1400000000001s)]
*  You thought this wasn't working? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=634.38s)]
*  I thought it wasn't working. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=635.38s)]
*  Dr. Desjardins wanted to go back to traditional treatment, maybe another surgery. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=636.98s)]
*  But Stephanie decided against her advice to wait. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=642.0200000000001s)]
*  By October, five months after her infusion, an MRI showed that the tumor hadn't been growing [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=645.86s)]
*  at all. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=652.34s)]
*  It turned out it only looked worse because it was inflamed. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=653.38s)]
*  Stephanie's immune system had awakened to the cancer and gone to war. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=658.34s)]
*  Why didn't the immune system react to the cancer to begin with? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=663.42s)]
*  So cancers, all human cancers, they develop a shield, a shroud of protective measures [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=667.18s)]
*  that make them invisible to the immune system. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=675.86s)]
*  This is precisely what we try to reverse with our virus. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=679.86s)]
*  So by infecting the tumor, we are actually removing this protective shield and enabling [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=684.38s)]
*  the immune system to come in and attack. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=694.1800000000001s)]
*  So essentially what's happening here inside the tumor is you have a polio infection. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=696.94s)]
*  And that sets off an alarm for the immune system. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=702.5400000000001s)]
*  The immune system says, there's a polio infection, we better go kill it. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=705.3800000000001s)]
*  And it turns out it's the tumor. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=709.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=711.82s)]
*  It appears the polio starts the killing, but it's the immune system that does most of the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=712.82s)]
*  damage. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=717.82s)]
*  Stephanie's tumor shrank for 21 months until it was gone. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=718.82s)]
*  This is an MRI from this past August. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=724.42s)]
*  Three years after the infusion, something unimaginable has happened for a patient with [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=727.3s)]
*  recurrent glioblastoma. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=732.78s)]
*  And there's no cancer in this picture at all. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=735.02s)]
*  We don't see any cancer, active cancer cells in the tumor at all. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=737.22s)]
*  She is cancer-free. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=740.7s)]
*  The only thing that remains is this hole, which is an artifact of an early surgery. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=742.5s)]
*  Under traditional standard of care treatment, Stephanie should not be standing here next [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=748.4200000000001s)]
*  to us today. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=754.78s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=755.78s)]
*  Stephanie, when they showed this to you, what did you think? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=756.78s)]
*  I wanted to cry with excitement this time. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=761.9s)]
*  How surprised are you by that? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=766.42s)]
*  I'm surprised because you never expect on a phase one study in particular, which is [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=768.26s)]
*  what she is on, to have these kind of results. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=774.5s)]
*  You're not expecting to cure people in a phase one trial. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=777.22s)]
*  You're not even necessarily expecting to help them. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=779.54s)]
*  You hope so, but that's not the design of a phase one study. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=781.3s)]
*  It's designed to get the right dose. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=784.22s)]
*  When you get anything on top of that, it's cake. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=786.54s)]
*  Quite a cake. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=789.14s)]
*  Quite a cake. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=790.14s)]
*  Biggest cake we've seen in a long, long time. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=791.14s)]
*  Tell me what you see there. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=793.62s)]
*  Dr. Fritz Anderson showed us the results in another patient, himself. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=794.8199999999999s)]
*  He's a retired cardiologist and at age 70, he became the second person in the polio trial. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=800.22s)]
*  This is a fairly sizable temporal tumor, which means... [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=806.78s)]
*  That we see right here. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=811.38s)]
*  On the left is his tumor before treatment. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=812.62s)]
*  On the right, a hairline scar where it used to be. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=815.54s)]
*  Like Stephanie, that was nearly three years ago. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=819.9s)]
*  When they said that this thing is just a small scar and we think it's possibly cured, I [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=823.3399999999999s)]
*  knew it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=828.5s)]
*  It fell off my chair. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=829.5s)]
*  I said, that's impossible. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=830.5s)]
*  They said, well, we don't know, but so far it looks fantastic. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=831.5s)]
*  Do you consider yourself cured or do you call it remission? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=836.6999999999999s)]
*  I feel it as a cure. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=841.2199999999999s)]
*  I live my life that way. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=842.4599999999999s)]
*  Fritz and Stephanie met for the first time here at 60 Minutes when we interviewed them [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=844.78s)]
*  last fall. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=849.26s)]
*  My head popped. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=850.26s)]
*  There you go. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=851.26s)]
*  Was yours on your right side? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=852.26s)]
*  No, on the left. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=854.26s)]
*  Which one's yours? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=855.26s)]
*  My right. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=856.26s)]
*  Right to left. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=857.26s)]
*  There we go. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=858.26s)]
*  With the early success, the team raised the dose in the next few patients in hope of an [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=859.26s)]
*  even better result. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=864.38s)]
*  But that's when the polio trial encountered its first tragedies. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=866.18s)]
*  When we come back, we'll look at how the virus is working in Nancy Justice, who we met in [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=870.14s)]
*  and at what they've discovered after trying polio against lung cancer, breast cancer, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=875.74s)]
*  and many others. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=883.14s)]
*  For nearly a year, we've been following the clinical trial at Duke University where the [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=895.9399999999999s)]
*  polio virus is being used to kill a vicious brain cancer called glioblastoma. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=900.5s)]
*  The goal of the experiment was to discover the right dose of the virus. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=906.42s)]
*  The first two patients saw their tumors melt away, so with that remarkable result at small [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=910.94s)]
*  doses, the researchers increased the potency of the virus in the next patients. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=916.22s)]
*  That's how they made a tragic but vital discovery about the power of immunotherapy in killing [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=922.22s)]
*  cancer. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=928.02s)]
*  Maybe you just close one eye. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=929.54s)]
*  It's been three years since Stephanie Lipscomb became the first patient to see her recurrent [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=931.22s)]
*  glioblastoma wiped out by polio. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=936.06s)]
*  Problem with memory? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=940.02s)]
*  No. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=941.02s)]
*  Vision? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=942.02s)]
*  No. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=943.02s)]
*  She gets a checkup at Duke every four months. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=944.02s)]
*  Hey. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=946.62s)]
*  How are you? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=947.62s)]
*  Good. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=948.62s)]
*  And she's become a celebrity to the new patients starting the polio trial. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=949.62s)]
*  60-year-old Donna Clegg, a social worker from Idaho, will be patient number 14. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=954.18s)]
*  We're going to do it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=958.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=960.78s)]
*  High five. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=961.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=962.78s)]
*  This was Donna Clegg before cancer, and this is how we found her last June, puffy from [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=963.78s)]
*  the steroids they'd used to limit the swelling in her brain. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=970.62s)]
*  Like others in the trial, she'd had surgery, chemo, and radiation, but the glioblastoma [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=974.54s)]
*  came back and the polio virus was her last chance. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=979.3399999999999s)]
*  I want to be able to live. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=983.82s)]
*  So that's kind of how I feel that this is going to be my opportunity to have a full [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=987.14s)]
*  life. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=993.42s)]
*  Donna's polio infusion was three times more potent than the one that worked for Stephanie. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=994.42s)]
*  And that's the whole idea behind this phase one trial, to increase the dose in succeeding [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1001.86s)]
*  patients step by step in search of the best result. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1007.14s)]
*  Dr. Henry Friedman is deputy director of Duke's Brain Tumor Center. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1011.1800000000001s)]
*  We believe in the philosophy we've learned in chemotherapy that more is better. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1015.54s)]
*  So if we were getting a good response at dose level one or dose level two, then go to dose [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1019.1s)]
*  level three, four, five. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1023.4200000000001s)]
*  In Donna Clegg, doctors saw the expected inflammation as her immune system attacked the tumor. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1025.14s)]
*  But the higher dose caused an immune response that was much too powerful. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1030.94s)]
*  The inflammation put so much pressure on her brain, she became partially paralyzed. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1036.72s)]
*  Back home in Idaho, she decided it was all too much and dropped out of the polio trial. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1041.92s)]
*  I thought this was the miracle. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1048.2s)]
*  Her husband recorded this in a nursing home. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1050.56s)]
*  When you're told you either take this chance or die, what would you do? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1053.44s)]
*  You had the to do over again, what would you do? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1059.64s)]
*  I may not have done it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1062.1200000000001s)]
*  Donna Clegg died three weeks ago. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1063.76s)]
*  Because she left the trial, doctors at Duke can only theorize that it was a combination [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1067.36s)]
*  of the advanced state of her disease and the ferocious immune response that ended her life. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1072.0s)]
*  Donna Clegg suffered quite a lot, and I wonder how that weighs on your mind. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1078.28s)]
*  Every patient who has an outcome that is not positive weighs on my mind. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1084.84s)]
*  I think that when you're doing a phase one study, you know that these things can happen. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1089.04s)]
*  And I don't think that we helped her quality of life. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1093.76s)]
*  We've learned something. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1097.44s)]
*  And I don't know that their family will take heart in the fact that they're part of a legacy [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1099.28s)]
*  of passing the torch to more patients that follow. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1102.72s)]
*  I hope that that means something to them. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1105.6s)]
*  But she is a patient who really did not derive benefit and yet taught us something important. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1108.0s)]
*  You discovered that putting in too much polio virus created too large an immune response. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1113.3999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1118.04s)]
*  And that was the turning point in the daring polio trial. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1119.04s)]
*  What was learned from Donna Clegg's death may give life to Nancy Justice. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1125.36s)]
*  Neuro-oncologist Dr. Anique Desjardins cut the potency of Nancy's infusion by 85 percent. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1130.48s)]
*  It was a lower dose than they had ever intended to use in the study. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1138.0s)]
*  Even so, Dr. Desjardins expected a big immune response. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1142.42s)]
*  In the next four to six months, we should see the inflammation, so the immune system, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1146.84s)]
*  waking up, starting to kill the tumor. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1152.2s)]
*  You will expect to see her MRI look worse in the early days? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1154.28s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1158.76s)]
*  Before it gets better? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1159.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1160.76s)]
*  It certainly did. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1161.76s)]
*  After she returned to Georgia, Nancy's symptoms started to resemble Donna Clegg's. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1164.44s)]
*  She had trouble with words. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1169.28s)]
*  Her right side was weak. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1170.84s)]
*  Her husband Greg took her back to Duke for an emergency MRI. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1173.2s)]
*  This was Nancy's tumor before the polio infusion. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1177.64s)]
*  Three months later, the site had doubled in size. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1181.48s)]
*  The swelling had pushed one hemisphere of her brain into the other. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1185.1200000000001s)]
*  Dr. Desjardins ordered a small dose of a cancer drug called Avastin not to treat the tumor, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1189.6000000000001s)]
*  but to reduce the swelling. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1197.76s)]
*  Nancy's symptoms improved right away. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1200.0800000000002s)]
*  And two weeks ago, Nancy had a new MRI. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1203.0s)]
*  It was four and a half months since her polio infusion, and we joined her husband and sons [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1206.8s)]
*  to see the new image for the first time. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1212.4s)]
*  And you haven't had a chance to see it yet, so show us, Doctor, what you have. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1215.88s)]
*  So glioblastoma is a tumor that's left untreated. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1219.84s)]
*  You expect the tumor to double in size every two, three weeks. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1223.12s)]
*  So the fact that we don't see the tumor growing back, we don't see the swelling coming [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1227.16s)]
*  back, we don't see Nancy getting worse, all of that is very positive. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1232.96s)]
*  It's a sign that the polio virus is doing its job. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1239.0s)]
*  On the left is the inflammation that we saw earlier. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1243.64s)]
*  On the right is the new MRI. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1247.16s)]
*  Her tumor has a gaping hole. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1250.1200000000001s)]
*  It's being wrecked from the inside out. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1253.08s)]
*  So where does this go from here? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1256.3s)]
*  So now we keep following her, and hopefully it keeps shrinking and it keeps collapsing. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1258.24s)]
*  And that's what we have seen with Fritz and Stephanie, that it continued shrinking for [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1264.28s)]
*  years. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1269.28s)]
*  Nancy, when you look at this, what do you think? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1270.28s)]
*  Oh, it's amazing. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1271.76s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1272.76s)]
*  I mean, thank you, Lord, and these doctors. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1273.76s)]
*  Thank you, doctors. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1276.44s)]
*  You know, and to just see this, you know, that's life. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1278.2s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to not just start crying. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1284.0s)]
*  So far, there have been 22 patients in the polio trial. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1288.48s)]
*  Eleven died. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1292.28s)]
*  Most of them had the higher dose. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1293.84s)]
*  But even so, they live months longer than expected. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1296.3s)]
*  The other 11 continue to improve. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1299.44s)]
*  Four are past six months, which Duke calls remission. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1302.52s)]
*  We clearly are producing a very, very significant benefit. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1306.64s)]
*  We've got an increase in median survival of over six months, which is huge in glioblastoma. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1311.1200000000001s)]
*  Six months doesn't sound like very much. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1316.28s)]
*  It doesn't sound like much, but that's just the midpoint. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1317.96s)]
*  So we've got patients that are out as far as 33, 34 months. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1320.3999999999999s)]
*  That is just unheard of in this disease. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1324.84s)]
*  Dr. Darrell Bigner is the head of the study and of Duke's Brain Tumor Center. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1326.96s)]
*  He's been fighting brain cancer 50 years, and he told us he has never seen results like [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1332.0s)]
*  those in patients Fritz Anderson and Stephanie Lipscomb. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1337.48s)]
*  Based on what you have seen, is it fair to say that Stephanie and Fritz are in remission? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1342.04s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1347.72s)]
*  That's probably a very good term to use. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1349.52s)]
*  They're in remission, and I think they would tell you that they consider themselves normal again. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1353.0s)]
*  Cured? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1359.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm very reluctant to use the cure word, the C word, as we call it, because we [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1361.1200000000001s)]
*  We don't know how long it takes to say that a glioblastoma has been cured, but I am beginning [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1370.44s)]
*  to think about it. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1378.64s)]
*  Close your eyes for me. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1379.64s)]
*  What side am I touching you? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1380.64s)]
*  My left. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1381.64s)]
*  But what they've achieved in this rare form of cancer may be just the beginning. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1382.64s)]
*  Molecular biologist Mathias Grohmeier, the creator of the virus, is pressing ahead. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1390.48s)]
*  You have been testing this therapy against a number of other cancers just in a laboratory [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1396.08s)]
*  dish. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1400.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1401.96s)]
*  What have you been able to kill so far? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1402.96s)]
*  So we have done this for lung cancers, breast cancers, colorectal cancers, prostate cancers, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1403.96s)]
*  pancreatic cancers, liver cancers, renal cancers. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1409.8799999999999s)]
*  We probably see this in just about any type of cancer you can imagine. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1412.8799999999999s)]
*  The man who's overseeing the polio trial for the FDA is Dr. Peter Marks, a deputy director [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1417.46s)]
*  responsible for hundreds of other experimental treatments for cancer. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1424.52s)]
*  You have to wonder if it's too good to be true. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1427.52s)]
*  Some of the results in these early trials appear nearly miraculous. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1431.08s)]
*  We hope they really are miraculous, but we do have to be cautious because sometimes people [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1435.32s)]
*  just get lucky and the first patients they treat with the therapy respond very well, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1440.6s)]
*  but subsequently additional patients don't. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1446.68s)]
*  Help me put immunotherapy in perspective here. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1449.6s)]
*  How big an advance is this in terms of viruses to treat cancer? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1453.36s)]
*  The field of immunotherapy is tremendously exciting. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1458.6399999999999s)]
*  It's been a paradigm shift in how we go about treating cancer because there are real products [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1461.8s)]

*  So we all know about surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, but now this is a fourth weapon. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1471.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1477.36s)]
*  Already, ten drugs that trigger the immune system have been approved and they are significantly [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1478.36s)]

*  According to the rules of the FDA, Dr. Marks could not speak to us specifically about the [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1489.52s)]
*  polio trial, but in about a year, the FDA is expected to make a decision about whether [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1494.24s)]

*  Before he became the second patient in the Duke trial, he wrote his own obituary. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1516.64s)]
*  He'll have to update it. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1521.76s)]
*  Three years later, he's cancer free. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1523.52s)]

*  Stephanie Lipscomb wasn't supposed to see her 22nd birthday. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1528.88s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1533.16s)]
*  Three years later, she's graduated from nursing school. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1534.28s)]
*  Do you think being a cancer survivor is going to make you a better nurse? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1537.72s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1541.32s)]
*  It already has. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1542.32s)]
*  Just because I've been a scared patient and so I know I would have, I loved it when nurses [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1543.32s)]
*  helped my hand. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1548.92s)]
*  So I like to be there and be there emotionally for them too. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1550.2s)]
*  And as Nancy Justice's tumor continues to shrink, it's now leaving room for her imagination [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1555.36s)]
*  to grow. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1561.94s)]
*  Nancy, months ago when I met you for the first time, they were dripping the polio virus into [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1563.1000000000001s)]
*  your tumor. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1568.54s)]
*  And you told me about some of the things that you were determined to see in the lives of [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1570.38s)]
*  these boys. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1576.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1577.02s)]
*  I wonder if you're at a place now where you can start making plans. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1578.02s)]
*  Oh definitely. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1580.66s)]
*  I mean that has, that's been what's kept me going. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1581.66s)]
*  I will see them graduate college. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1585.3s)]
*  I will see them get married and I will have grandchildren. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1588.94s)]
*  In that order. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1592.5s)]
*  A bold experiment to kill a vicious cancer has won breakthrough status from the Food [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1594.5s)]
*  and Drug Administration. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1622.8200000000002s)]
*  Early tests at Duke University have been so successful, the FDA will fast track this treatment [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1624.6200000000001s)]
*  to hundreds of patients while it's still being evaluated for final approval. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1630.38s)]
*  The therapy is audacious. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1635.46s)]
*  It uses the polio virus to attack a virulent brain cancer called glioblastoma, which is [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1637.98s)]
*  a death sentence of astonishing speed that leaves patients with only months to live. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1645.5s)]
*  For two years, we've been following volunteers in the Duke clinical trial. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1651.76s)]
*  We have witnessed nearly miraculous recoveries and unexpected defeats on a journey of discovery [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1656.58s)]
*  beyond the known frontiers of science. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1664.32s)]

*  At age 58, she had recurrent glioblastoma. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1675.28s)]
*  It had come back after surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1678.82s)]
*  Typically, she could expect to live seven months. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1683.62s)]
*  The polio virus, which mankind had fought to eradicate from the earth, was the last [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1688.1s)]
*  chance she had in the world. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1693.6799999999998s)]
*  A half teaspoon of polio flowed through a catheter inserted through Nancy's skull directly [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1698.4199999999998s)]

*  Are you ready to go? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1706.48s)]
*  I'm ready. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1707.48s)]
*  We're starting. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1709.14s)]
*  921. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1710.14s)]
*  If you feel anything, you let us know. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1711.14s)]
*  I will, definitely. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1713.7s)]
*  Her husband Greg constantly inflated a buoyant optimism to save him from the weight of the [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1715.54s)]

*  Her glioblastoma was diagnosed in the 21st year of Nancy and Greg's marriage, just as [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1724.48s)]
*  the Georgia couple could make out the finish line for Zach and Luke at college. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1730.24s)]
*  Her tumor can double in size every two weeks. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1735.66s)]
*  The tumor was aggressive, so you wanted an aggressive treatment. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1739.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1743.28s)]
*  You're a medical explorer. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1744.28s)]
*  Does it feel that way to you? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1747.96s)]
*  I'm taking it one day at a time. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1749.3600000000001s)]
*  It sounds very lofty to say medical explorer, but throughout all of this, if this gives [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1753.3200000000002s)]
*  other people hope, I'm all for it. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1760.52s)]
*  Greg, you mentioned that Nancy was there for every important event in the boys' lives, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1763.26s)]
*  but there are a lot of important events to come. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1768.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1771.22s)]
*  What do you hope to see? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1772.22s)]
*  So, I am going to see those boys walk across the stage at their college graduation. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1773.22s)]
*  I am going to see them get married, and I am going to see them get kids, preferably [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1778.46s)]
*  in that order. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1782.82s)]
*  And I know it's like such a mom bucket list, but I'll love every minute of it. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1785.28s)]
*  The number of calls are increasing again. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1790.6200000000001s)]
*  This is Duke's poliotine. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1793.6799999999998s)]
*  Dr. Darrell Bigner, director of the Tisch Brain Tumor Center, molecular biologist Mathias [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1794.6799999999998s)]
*  Gromeyer, and neuro-oncologist Dr. Henry Friedman and Dr. Anik Desjardins. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1800.72s)]
*  As is typical, the university has licensed this technology to a new company to attract [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1808.22s)]
*  research dollars to the therapy, and all the members of the team are investors. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1813.6s)]
*  Good to see that this is going well. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1818.1599999999999s)]
*  Dr. Friedman screens more than 1,000 glioblastoma patients a year who would like to be treated [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1820.5s)]
*  at Duke. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1826.1000000000001s)]
*  He helps decide who meets the criteria for the polio trial. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1827.3000000000002s)]
*  I wonder, of all the trials and all of the theories and all of the treatments that you [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1831.5s)]
*  have hoped for all of these years, how does this stack up? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1838.38s)]
*  This to me is the most promising therapy I've seen in my career, period. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1843.66s)]
*  The virus is the creation of, the obsession of, Dr. Gromeyer, who has been laboring over [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1848.44s)]
*  this for more than 25 years, the last 15 at Duke. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1854.68s)]
*  When you went to your colleagues and said, I've got it, we'll use the polio virus to [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1859.8799999999999s)]
*  kill cancer, what did they say? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1863.96s)]
*  Well, I got a range of responses from crazy to lying, to all kinds of things. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1867.24s)]
*  Most people thought it just was too dangerous. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1876.0s)]
*  I thought he was nuts. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1878.6200000000001s)]
*  I really thought that what he's using is a weapon that produces paralysis. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1879.6200000000001s)]
*  Other researchers are experimenting with cancer treatments using viruses including HIV, smallpox [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1886.06s)]
*  and measles. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1893.02s)]
*  But polio was Dr. Gromeyer's choice because as luck would have it, it seeks out and attaches [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1894.4s)]
*  to a receptor that is found on the surface of the cells that make up nearly every kind [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1901.24s)]
*  of solid tumor. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1907.3s)]
*  It's almost as if polio had evolved for the purpose. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1908.8799999999999s)]
*  Here is the genetic material. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1912.52s)]
*  Gromeyer re-engineered the virus, removing a key genetic sequence. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1914.32s)]
*  The virus can't survive this way, so he repaired the damage with a harmless bit of cold virus. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1919.04s)]
*  This new modified polio virus can't cause paralysis or death because it can't reproduce [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1925.76s)]
*  in normal cells. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1932.0s)]
*  But in cancer cells, it does. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1933.88s)]
*  And in the process of replicating, it releases toxins that poison the cell. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1936.48s)]
*  At least, that's what they'd observed in the laboratory. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1942.16s)]
*  Eventually, they had to try it in a human being. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1945.5400000000002s)]
*  It's a hell of a thing to be told that you have months to live when you're 20 years old. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1950.1000000000001s)]
*  In 2011, Stephanie Lipscomb was a nursing student with headaches. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1955.0800000000002s)]
*  A doctor told her she had this glioblastoma tumor the size of a tennis ball. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1959.5s)]
*  I looked at the nurse that was sitting there holding my hand and I said, I don't understand. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1965.58s)]
*  What did he just say? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1973.42s)]
*  It's kind of hard for me to process. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1975.14s)]
*  You had 98% of the tumor removed. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1978.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1980.78s)]
*  As much radiation as you can have in a lifetime and chemotherapy. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1981.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1986.22s)]
*  And then in 2012, what did the doctors tell you? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1987.3s)]
*  Your cancer's back. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1991.3s)]
*  With recurrent glioblastoma, there were no options except the one that had never been [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1993.22s)]
*  tried. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=1999.1s)]
*  Did they tell you that it had never been tried in a human being before? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2000.7s)]
*  They did. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2003.8999999999999s)]
*  But at the same time, I had nothing to lose, honestly. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2004.8999999999999s)]
*  Her polio treatment began in 2012 and from the very beginning, it looked like a bad bet. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2010.86s)]
*  So we treated her in May. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2018.82s)]
*  Then in July, the tumor looked bigger, looked really inflamed. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2021.6599999999999s)]
*  I got really concerned, got really worried. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2025.2199999999998s)]
*  You thought this wasn't working? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2027.4599999999998s)]
*  I thought it wasn't working. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2028.4599999999998s)]
*  Neuro-oncologist Annick Desjardins wanted to abandon the polio experiment and return [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2030.1s)]
*  to traditional treatment, but Stephanie said no. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2035.26s)]
*  Five months after her infusion, an MRI showed the tumor only looked worse because of inflammation [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2039.5800000000002s)]
*  caused by Stephanie's immune system, which had awakened to the cancer for the first time [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2047.78s)]
*  and gone to war. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2053.66s)]
*  Why didn't the immune system react to the cancer to begin with? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2055.62s)]
*  So cancers, all human cancers, they develop a shield, a shroud of protective measures [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2059.38s)]
*  that make them invisible to the immune system. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2068.1s)]
*  And this is precisely what we try to reverse with our virus. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2072.02s)]
*  So by infecting the tumor, we are actually removing this protective shield and telling [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2076.58s)]
*  them, enabling the immune system to come in and attack. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2085.02s)]
*  So essentially what's happening here inside the tumor is you have a polio infection. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2089.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2093.98s)]
*  And that sets off an alarm for the immune system. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2094.98s)]
*  The immune system says there's a polio infection, we better go kill it. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2097.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2101.7s)]
*  And it turns out it's the tumor. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2102.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2103.98s)]
*  It appears the polio starts the killing, but the immune system does most of the damage. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2104.98s)]
*  Stephanie's tumor shrank for 21 months until it was gone. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2111.34s)]
*  Three years after the infusion, something unimaginable had happened. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2115.94s)]
*  This is from an MRI in August 2014. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2120.9s)]
*  And there's no cancer in this picture at all. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2124.46s)]
*  We don't see any cancer active in our cells. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2126.8199999999997s)]
*  She is cancer free. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2129.1s)]
*  All that remains is this hole from an early surgery. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2131.06s)]
*  How surprised are you by that? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2134.94s)]
*  I'm surprised because you never expect on a phase one study in particular to have these [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2136.74s)]
*  kind of results. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2143.46s)]
*  You're not expecting to cure people in a phase one trial? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2144.54s)]
*  You're not even necessarily expecting to help them. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2146.8199999999997s)]
*  You hope so. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2148.62s)]
*  But that's not the design of a phase one study. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2149.62s)]
*  It's designed to get the right dose. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2151.54s)]
*  When you get anything on top of that, it's cake. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2153.8399999999997s)]
*  Quite a cake. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2157.02s)]
*  Biggest cake we've seen in a long, long time. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2158.02s)]
*  Dr. Fritz Anderson showed us the results in another patient, himself. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2161.02s)]
*  He's a retired cardiologist, and at age 70, he became the second person in the polio trial. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2166.6600000000003s)]
*  This is a fairly sizable temporal tumor, which means... [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2173.1000000000004s)]
*  That we see right here. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2177.7000000000003s)]
*  On the left is his tumor before treatment. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2179.1800000000003s)]
*  On the right, a hairline scar where it used to be. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2182.24s)]
*  That was nearly three years ago. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2186.68s)]
*  Do you consider yourself cured? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2189.54s)]
*  Or do you call it remission? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2192.16s)]
*  I feel it as a cure. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2194.08s)]
*  I live my life that way. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2195.3199999999997s)]
*  After the early successes, the next patients would receive a higher dose. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2197.8599999999997s)]
*  That's the whole idea behind a phase one trial, to increase the dose in succeeding patients [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2202.4399999999996s)]
*  step by step in search of the highest dose that is still safe. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2208.2s)]
*  We believe in the philosophy we've learned in chemotherapy that more is better. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2213.4399999999996s)]
*  So if we were getting a good response at dose level one or dose level two, then go to dose [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2217.0s)]
*  level three, four, five. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2221.3199999999997s)]
*  Sixty-year-old Donna Clegg was a social worker from Idaho. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2223.3999999999996s)]
*  We met her in 2014, puffy from the steroids used to reduce the swelling in her brain. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2227.3999999999996s)]
*  I want to be able to live. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2234.2s)]
*  So that's kind of how I feel that this is going to be my opportunity to have a full [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2237.5s)]
*  life. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2244.18s)]
*  Donna's polio infusion was three times more potent than the one that had worked for Stephanie. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2245.18s)]
*  But in her case, this higher dose set off an immune response that was much too powerful. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2251.48s)]
*  Donna battled the inflammation for nine months before she died in March 2015. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2258.06s)]
*  Donna Clegg suffered quite a lot, and I wonder how that weighs on your mind. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2264.86s)]
*  Every patient who has an outcome that is not positive weighs on my mind. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2271.0s)]
*  I think that when you're doing a phase one study, you know that these things can happen, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2275.2200000000003s)]
*  but she is a patient who really did not derive benefit and yet taught us something important. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2279.6800000000003s)]
*  You discovered that putting in too much polio virus created too large an immune response. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2284.82s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2289.6200000000003s)]
*  After that hard lesson, doctors cut the potency of Nancy Justice's dose by 85 percent. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2291.06s)]
*  It was less than they had ever expected to use. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2297.6s)]
*  They called this new dose, dose minus one. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2300.9s)]
*  But even so, four and a half months after her infusion in March 2015, inflammation had [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2305.02s)]
*  caused the mass in Nancy's brain to double in size. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2312.02s)]
*  But to Dr. Desjardins, the tumor looked weaker. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2316.66s)]
*  And in this image, it's shot through full of holes. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2320.64s)]
*  It's shot through full of holes. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2324.48s)]
*  And let me show you the next picture and you'll see it's even more and more holes. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2325.7599999999998s)]
*  So where does this go from here? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2331.54s)]
*  So now we keep following her, and hopefully keeps shrinking, and it keeps collapsing. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2333.48s)]
*  And that's what we have seen with Fritz and Stephanie, that it continued shrinking for years. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2339.48s)]
*  Nancy, when you look at this, what do you think? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2345.2s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2347.56s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2348.56s)]
*  Thank you, Lord, and these doctors. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2349.96s)]
*  Thank you, doctors. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2351.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, and to just see this, you know, that's life. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2353.24s)]
*  Nancy Justice faces a hard road ahead. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2361.04s)]
*  But along the way, new discoveries will take the researchers in a direction they never imagined. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2364.32s)]
*  Thirty-eight patients have volunteered for Duke University's experiment to use the poliovirus [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2379.56s)]
*  to kill glioblastoma, the most efficient, relentless cancer of the brain. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2388.32s)]
*  The FDA's decision to grant Duke breakthrough status means the second phase of the trial [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2394.4s)]
*  will be expanded to about 40 institutions with hundreds of patients. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2399.64s)]
*  If that goes well, Duke will be allowed to skip the third phase of the trial and make [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2404.68s)]
*  poliotherapy for glioblastoma available to all. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2409.9199999999996s)]
*  The route to this achievement was not a straight line. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2414.52s)]
*  The first volunteers saw their tumors disappear, but later patients suffered crippling setbacks. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2417.48s)]
*  There was a way forward, but researchers found themselves on a path they had not imagined. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2424.96s)]
*  Their guide through the mystery was a patient named Brendan Steele. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2430.6s)]
*  On Christmas Eve 2009, Brendan Steele could not know how precious the gift of life would be. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2438.72s)]
*  At 37, he was an IT manager in Montana, a husband and father of three. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2446.2s)]
*  But then, doctors found glioblastoma and gave him 11 months to say goodbye. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2451.8199999999997s)]
*  When surgery, radiation and chemotherapy failed, Brendan volunteered for Duke's polio trial. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2458.84s)]
*  And in 2013, he received the six-hour poliovirus infusion. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2465.84s)]
*  But in removing the catheter, a blood vessel was severed. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2471.32s)]
*  His wife Kathy was by his side. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2476.42s)]
*  Brendan said, it's weird, and he goes to hold his head and weird just kind of pulled, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2479.1200000000003s)]
*  drained out, like that was the end of his speech. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2485.2400000000002s)]
*  You understood how bad off you were? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2488.08s)]
*  No. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2490.84s)]
*  No? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2491.84s)]
*  No, because I don't remember. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2492.84s)]
*  Emergency surgery stopped the bleeding, but the trauma left Brendan barely able to walk or talk. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2496.84s)]
*  Seven months later, a biopsy revealed that his tumor was growing. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2503.84s)]
*  Doctors gave Brendan chemotherapy. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2509.7599999999998s)]
*  It had failed him before, but it might give him just a few more weeks. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2511.72s)]
*  Neuro-oncologist Annick Desjardins did not imagine what happened next. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2517.24s)]
*  We gave him one dose of chemotherapy, and the lesion just melted, went away rapidly, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2522.8399999999997s)]
*  which we don't see that happen normally. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2532.2s)]
*  Two months after that single dose of chemo, the tumor, the white mass on the right, started [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2535.2s)]
*  to break up. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2541.3199999999997s)]
*  Brendan continued the chemotherapy, and in eight months, it was gone. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2542.76s)]
*  And what do the doctors tell you about your cancer today? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2547.7200000000003s)]
*  No cancer. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2551.5600000000004s)]
*  No cancer. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2553.1200000000003s)]
*  Recurrent glioblastoma. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2554.28s)]
*  And now they tell you they cannot find it in your brain. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2556.88s)]
*  Yep. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2559.84s)]
*  Brendan Steele has lived 35 months since his polio infusion. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2560.84s)]
*  He's been cancer-free for 19. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2565.84s)]
*  Dr. Henry Friedman, deputy director of Duke's Cancer Center, has a theory about why the [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2568.8399999999997s)]
*  chemo worked this time when it never had before. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2574.08s)]
*  Shockingly, chemotherapy in patients who have previously failed it, once they've had the [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2578.2s)]
*  polio virus therapy, now seem to have a new, enhanced, almost extraordinary response to [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2586.7999999999997s)]
*  the chemotherapy. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2593.72s)]
*  The polio virus has set up the tumor to be more responsive to chemotherapy. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2594.72s)]
*  That was a surprise? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2599.52s)]
*  That was a surprise. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2600.9199999999996s)]
*  And for us to see this, it was a stunning observation that is actually the platform [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2601.9199999999996s)]
*  for a future study that will involve chemotherapy and the polio virus. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2607.4399999999996s)]
*  The discovery changed their approach to Nancy Justice. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2611.4399999999996s)]
*  You'll remember when we last saw Nancy in March 2015. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2615.2s)]
*  Dr. Desjardins saw signs her tumor was breaking up. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2618.4399999999996s)]
*  But in the months that followed, the inflammation kept growing. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2622.96s)]
*  As Nancy's brain compressed, she was losing the connections to her arm, her legs, and [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2626.96s)]
*  her relationship to the very space around her. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2633.8s)]
*  And touch your nose here. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2637.0s)]
*  To your nose. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2640.4s)]
*  Yep, to your nose. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2641.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2642.4s)]
*  Whatever part of the brain involves the will to fight appeared to be unaffected. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2643.4s)]
*  Now, would a single dose of chemotherapy have the same miraculous result as it did for Brendan [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2649.24s)]
*  Steele? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2655.04s)]
*  Dr. Desjardins reached for their new discovery, and within two months, the mass was shrinking. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2656.04s)]
*  See how the folds of the brain are back when they were all squished shut? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2662.44s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2665.8399999999997s)]
*  The ventricle is reopening. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2666.8399999999997s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2667.8399999999997s)]
*  Hallelujah. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2668.8399999999997s)]
*  Now, that's what we're looking for, honey. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2669.8399999999997s)]
*  How did you feel at that time? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2673.5s)]
*  Oh, loved it. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2675.12s)]
*  I mean, that's what we've been working for, praying for. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2677.2400000000002s)]
*  Tumors getting smaller and smaller. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2681.96s)]
*  Somebody had taken a razor to it. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2683.6800000000003s)]
*  As the inflammation retreated, there was new space for hope. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2685.48s)]
*  Up, up, up, up, up, up. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2689.64s)]
*  Elbow straight, elbow straight. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2690.64s)]
*  Look at the speed, honey. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2691.64s)]
*  Nancy found strength and buoyed, always by her husband Greg, she walked up to a mile [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2693.6800000000003s)]
*  a day. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2699.08s)]
*  Nancy's life was covering a distance of time denied to glioblastoma patients. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2701.24s)]
*  But last February, 15 months after her infusion of polio, her run met another hurdle. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2707.2799999999997s)]
*  Just a little more inflammation. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2715.24s)]
*  The day her journey began, she told us she would see her sons graduate, be married, and [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2717.6s)]
*  have children. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2723.96s)]
*  In that order, she joked. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2725.24s)]
*  Now, determination was nuanced with gratitude for what she'd had already. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2727.48s)]
*  Nancy, when we met you the first time, I asked you about your mom bucket list. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2733.6400000000003s)]
*  How are those weddings and grandkids looking to you now? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2738.5600000000004s)]
*  Okay, so right now, I'm thinking it's just the simple things right now that I enjoy. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2743.1200000000003s)]
*  Seven weeks after that interview, in late March, Nancy was rushed back to Duke. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2752.3999999999996s)]
*  The light that never dimmed was in her eyes, but her words were gone. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2758.48s)]
*  This is what she was fighting. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2764.8799999999997s)]
*  The inflammation engulfed half her brain. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2767.0s)]
*  I just think we need to know what we're dealing with so we can move. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2770.08s)]
*  Neurosurgeon Alan Friedman needed to find out if the mass was a buildup of dead cells [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2773.68s)]
*  from the immune response or active cancer. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2777.74s)]
*  He slipped a needle into her brain to extract a bit of tissue. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2782.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2787.8199999999997s)]
*  See you there in a second. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2788.8199999999997s)]
*  The tissue was rushed to the pathology lab where a microscope discovered dead cells where [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2790.56s)]
*  the polio was working, but also regrowth of the tumor. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2795.54s)]
*  Glioblastoma had found a way back. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2800.66s)]
*  Hey, Nancy. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2803.5s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2804.5s)]
*  Seventeen months after we first met Nancy, doctors Alan Friedman and Anique Desjardins [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2806.06s)]
*  explained to Greg that Nancy's tumor had now infiltrated parts of her brain responsible [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2812.62s)]
*  for breathing and cognition. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2818.5s)]
*  She's getting worse, and maybe it's the time where we cannot do anything anymore to help [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2821.82s)]
*  her and we need to let her go. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2827.98s)]
*  We wondered whether Greg would do it all again. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2834.98s)]
*  Definitely we would do it. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2838.26s)]
*  Nancy would have been gone long ago, and I think it's given us some good time, and we [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2840.5s)]
*  appreciate that. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2847.42s)]
*  On April 6th, Nancy Justice, medical explorer, passed away at the age of 60. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2849.66s)]
*  She'd had nine more months than she could have expected. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2856.94s)]
*  What did Nancy teach you? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2861.82s)]
*  From the treatment standpoint, what she taught us is two different things. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2863.38s)]
*  So clearly the combination of the polio virus with the chemotherapy added first an amazing [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2867.2200000000003s)]
*  response. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2872.98s)]
*  We need to understand that. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2874.1400000000003s)]
*  The next thing is, at some point though it stopped working. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2875.76s)]
*  And why did that happen? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2880.42s)]
*  What the Duke team has learned is that inflammation is an unavoidable consequence of the immune [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2881.98s)]
*  systems attack in most patients, and that managing it with drugs will likely be a key [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2887.58s)]
*  to survival. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2893.7s)]
*  So far there have been 21 patients at this lowest dose, minus one. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2895.46s)]
*  Eight of them have died. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2898.9s)]
*  Put that in perspective for me. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2901.54s)]
*  All the ones who haven't died on a phase one trial is simply remarkable. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2903.38s)]
*  To see positive results in terms of controlling the tumor or shrinking the tumor in patients [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2908.94s)]
*  with recurrent disease on a phase one trial is remarkable. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2915.62s)]
*  It's not your goal. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2919.54s)]
*  It's not your expectation. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2920.82s)]
*  But it certainly is something that when you see it, you say this is really terrific. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2922.7s)]
*  This is special. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2926.7400000000002s)]
*  Apparently the FDA saw something special too. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2928.1s)]
*  Breakthrough status was granted after data showed that patients who'd been living an [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2931.9s)]
*  average of 10 months were living an average of 15 months. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2935.84s)]
*  And three patients showed no sign of cancer at all after three years. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2940.08s)]
*  Dr. Darrell Bigner, who runs Duke's Brain Tumor Center, has fought glioblastoma for [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2946.2799999999997s)]
*  50 years. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2952.54s)]
*  When you talk of median survival being extended from 10 months to 15 months, for some of these [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2954.52s)]
*  patients it's 15 months and counting. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2960.18s)]
*  They're still living. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2963.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2964.72s)]
*  We still have got significant periods of high quality survival. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2966.48s)]
*  And that is a huge difference. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2972.2799999999997s)]
*  And then we have patients like Stephanie Fritz and Brandon that are leading virtually normal [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2974.64s)]
*  lives. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2981.64s)]
*  I mean, they probably go many days without even thinking about having had a glioblastoma, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2982.64s)]
*  which is just amazing. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2990.0s)]
*  You were in medical school thinking about one day being able to beat glioblastoma. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2991.48s)]
*  And now you are standing on this doorstep. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=2998.2400000000002s)]
*  What does that mean to you personally? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3001.96s)]
*  It's an enormous feeling. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3003.92s)]
*  And I have to be very careful. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3007.0s)]
*  I never want to give anyone false hope. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3009.4s)]
*  But I see all of the science coming together now. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3013.16s)]
*  And I know it's going to happen. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3018.76s)]
*  I've never felt that way until now. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3020.04s)]
*  And in an amazing new development, this science may be coming together for an entire range [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3024.04s)]
*  of cancers. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3030.56s)]
*  In the laboratory, Duke has used polio to kill cancer cells of the skin, pancreas, stomach, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3032.4s)]
*  lung, colon and prostate. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3040.24s)]
*  Immunologist Dr. Smita Nair showed us what polio did to breast cancer in mice. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3043.68s)]
*  This is breast cancer tissue. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3050.08s)]
*  And what we find is, if you look at this, is here is a tumor that got injected with [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3051.44s)]
*  polio virus. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3056.28s)]
*  Here is a tumor that got injected with just saline. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3057.28s)]
*  And the difference in the tumor size is extremely visible here. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3060.96s)]
*  Night and day. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3066.36s)]
*  We kept seeing this. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3067.44s)]
*  So we went back and asked the question, what is happening in the tumors? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3068.64s)]
*  And we teased these tumors apart. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3073.4s)]
*  And what we found were a lot of T cells in the tumor. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3075.12s)]
*  Immune system cells. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEA6BQARqE8&t=3078.6s)]
