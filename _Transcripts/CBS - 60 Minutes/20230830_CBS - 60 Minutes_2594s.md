*  watched in horror. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=47.96s)]
*  This spring, 60 Minutes was given rare access to the painstaking restoration of Notre Dame, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=51.76s)]
*  as workers and artisans revived every part of this medieval masterpiece. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=58.32s)]

*  their families. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=118.2s)]

*  As we first reported in May, people in their 30s who are among the most connected online [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=135.26s)]
*  filed the most complaints. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=140.7s)]
*  But we were surprised to learn the group that loses the most money to scammers is seniors. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=142.85999999999999s)]

*  Tell me about the call that you got. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  There was a young adult on the line saying, grandma, I need your help, in a frantic voice, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=179.18s)]
*  saying I was driving and suddenly there was a woman stopped in front of me. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=188.58s)]
*  She's pregnant. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=193.78s)]

*  And they're going to take me to jail. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  And grandma, please don't call my mom and dad because I don't want them to know. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=199.74s)]
*  I said, Brandon, it doesn't sound like you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=204.9s)]
*  He said, oh, I have a cold, grandma. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=206.74s)]
*  You think it's your grandson? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  I do. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  And he said, grandma, a friend of mine has an attorney that we can use and that we can [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  do something about me going to jail. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=216.74s)]
*  And I said, yes, of course. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=219.06s)]
*  Monahan said the scammer, pretending to be a helpful attorney, got on the line. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=221.7s)]
*  It was June of 2020 during the pandemic, and he promised to keep her grandson out of jail [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=226.01999999999998s)]
*  if she could get $9,000 for bail to him quickly. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=232.06s)]
*  What other instructions were you given? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=236.94s)]
*  I needed to make an envelope that was addressed to this certain judge that he was going to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=238.9s)]
*  coordinate this through and write on there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  And they gave me the name, the address and everything else for this envelope. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=248.74s)]
*  Did it sound pretty legitimate? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=252.66000000000003s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=254.02s)]
*  He had the legalese. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=255.58s)]
*  Monahan is a tax preparer with an MBA. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  The scammer kept her on the phone as she rushed to the bank. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=260.58000000000004s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=264.18s)]
*  He said, when you go there, make sure you tell them that it's for home improvements, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=265.18s)]
*  because they might question the fact that you're withdrawing $9,000. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=269.18s)]
*  Minutes after Monahan got home with the cash, a courier showed up to take it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=275.22s)]
*  This is video from the doorbell camera. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=280.26000000000005s)]
*  You can hear Monahan on the phone with the scammer as she hands off the money. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=282.74s)]
*  She says as soon as the courier left and the adrenaline left her body, she was filled with [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=291.26000000000005s)]
*  a sick feeling she'd been scammed. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=295.98s)]
*  It's just devastating. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=298.62s)]
*  What did they do to your mom? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=301.1s)]
*  The federal trade commission reports scams like these skyrocketed 70% during the pandemic [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=303.22s)]
*  when seniors, home alone, went online to shop or keep in touch with family. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=317.5s)]
*  How much money were you scammed out of? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=322.58000000000004s)]
*  $11,300. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=324.74s)]
*  $14,000. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=325.74s)]
*  $7,600. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=326.74s)]
*  Judy Adig and her husband Ron, a retired iron worker, were victims of the same grandparent [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=327.74s)]
*  scam as Susan Monahan. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=337.74s)]
*  That's the view from their doorbell camera as the same courier took off with $7,600 of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=340.7s)]
*  their savings. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=346.54s)]
*  $7,600 hits hard. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=347.54s)]
*  Well, that was for our, you know, if we wanted to go on a trip or something. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=348.54s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=354.18s)]
*  I was a mess. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=355.18s)]
*  Steve Savage, a retired scientist, was scammed when he opened a fake email from the Geek Squad. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=356.62s)]
*  The email said that your bank account is being charged $399 for another year. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=363.74s)]
*  And I'm like, wait a minute, I don't remember it being anywhere close to that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=372.1s)]
*  The customer's service number went to a scammer posing as a representative of the company. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=376.3s)]
*  Savage was duped out of $14,000. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=381.5s)]
*  Esther Maestrate was scammed too. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=386.1s)]
*  The retired nurse says an alarm sounded on her iPad with a message to call tech support. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=388.78000000000003s)]
*  She did. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=394.42s)]
*  He said that last night between 4 and 9 p.m., your bank account has been hacked. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=395.42s)]
*  And your heart probably stopped. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=401.38s)]
*  You know, I felt so nervous. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  But he said, I am going to transfer you to another guy who is a security at Chase Bank. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=405.18s)]
*  That fake bank employee told her hackers might be able to access her bank account and instruct [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=411.3s)]
*  her to immediately withdraw money and deposit it into a new account for safekeeping. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=416.06s)]
*  Maestrate did and lost $11,000. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=422.14s)]
*  And have you been able to recover any of your money? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=426.38s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=429.58s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=430.58s)]
*  I'm the one that pulled the money out of the bank so I won't be reimbursed. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=431.58s)]
*  If your house gets broken into, you call the police. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=435.18s)]
*  If this happens, there's no one to call. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=438.18s)]
*  Scott Perello is a deputy district attorney who runs San Diego's elder justice task force [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=441.18s)]
*  and connected us to the victims you just heard from. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=447.46s)]
*  He says studies show only one in every 20 seniors who have been scammed report it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=450.5s)]
*  Often, they're embarrassed. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=455.97999999999996s)]
*  Most people who have not experienced this think, well, these people must have dementia [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=458.02s)]
*  or Alzheimer's. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=462.9s)]
*  It's not the case. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=463.9s)]
*  Our victims are sharp as a tack. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=465.09999999999997s)]
*  We had a woman, 66 years old. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=466.65999999999997s)]
*  She came home. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=469.18s)]
*  She got a message on her computer from Microsoft and the message said that she had a virus [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=470.22s)]
*  on her computer. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=475.02s)]

*  Within a matter of weeks, this victim had lost $800,000. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=481.90000000000003s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=486.54s)]
*  The scariest part of these scams is that these victims have no recourse. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=489.38s)]
*  They're left bewildered. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=494.46000000000004s)]

*  I'm sorry there's nothing we could do. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=503.74s)]
*  And that is the reality, that a local police detective in Kansas City doesn't have the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=506.54s)]
*  reach to go investigate a case that's being operated from the Caribbean or from Nigeria [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=512.42s)]
*  or Ghana. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=518.54s)]
*  Investigators have also traced scams to Europe, Southeast Asia, and Canada. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=520.14s)]
*  To combat them, San Diego's Elder Justice Task Force has taken a new approach. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=525.4599999999999s)]
*  Investigators collect every local fraud case, then collaborate with federal authorities [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=530.74s)]
*  to connect them. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=534.9s)]
*  If we have a victim that lost $12,000 here in San Diego, there is without question dozens [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=536.06s)]
*  of other victims to the same scam and millions of dollars in losses. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=543.3s)]
*  And then once we identify that the scam is part of something much larger, then we can [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=547.38s)]
*  deliver that to our federal partners with the reach to go around the country because [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=552.42s)]
*  these are networks. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=557.3399999999999s)]

*  yourself online. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=596.36s)]
*  Rachel Tobak is what's called an ethical hacker. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=597.7s)]
*  She studies how these criminals operate. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=600.6s)]
*  So ethical hackers, we step in and show you how it works. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=603.0s)]
*  Tobak is the CEO of Social Proof Security, a data protection firm that advises Fortune [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=606.18s)]
*  500 companies, the military, and private citizens on their vulnerabilities. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=611.78s)]
*  We hired her to show us how easy it is to use information found online to scam someone. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=617.06s)]
*  We asked her to target our unsuspecting colleague, Elizabeth. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=622.9799999999999s)]
*  Tobak found Elizabeth's cell phone number on a business networking website. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=627.06s)]
*  As we set up for an interview, Tobak called Elizabeth but used an AI-powered app to mimic [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=632.2s)]
*  my voice and ask for my passport number. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=638.5s)]
*  Oh, yes, yes, yes. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=641.6s)]
*  I do have it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=642.6s)]
*  Okay, ready? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=643.6s)]
*  It's... [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=644.6s)]
*  Tobak played the AI-generated voice recording for us to reveal the scam. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=645.6s)]
*  Elizabeth, sorry, need my passport number because the Ukraine trip is on. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=651.6s)]
*  Can you read that out to me? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=655.12s)]
*  Does that sound familiar? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=657.12s)]
*  And I gave her... [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=661.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=662.16s)]
*  I had her passport number. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=663.16s)]
*  I was duped. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=664.16s)]
*  I was sitting over there. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=665.16s)]
*  What did it say on your phone? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=666.16s)]
*  Sharon. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=667.16s)]
*  How did you do that? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=668.16s)]
*  So I used something called a spoofing tool to actually be able to call you as Sharon. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  So I was hacked and I failed. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=675.1999999999999s)]
*  I failed at hacking. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  Everybody would get tricked with that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=678.48s)]
*  Everybody would. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=681.0s)]
*  It says, Sharon, why would I not answer this call? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=682.0s)]
*  Why would I not give that information? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=684.24s)]
*  Tobak showed us how she took clips of me from television and put it into an app that cloned [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=686.24s)]
*  my voice. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=691.72s)]
*  It took about five minutes. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=692.72s)]
*  I am a public person. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=694.2800000000001s)]
*  My voice is out there. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=695.76s)]
*  Could a person who's not a public person like me be spoofed as easily? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=696.76s)]
*  Anybody can be spoofed. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=701.24s)]
*  And oftentimes attackers will go after people. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=702.4200000000001s)]
*  They don't even know who these people are. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=705.2800000000001s)]
*  But they just know this person has a relationship to this other person. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  And they can impersonate that person enough just by changing the pitch and the modulation [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=711.0200000000001s)]
*  of their voice that I believe that's my nephew and I need to really wire that money. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=715.36s)]
*  Tobak says hackers no longer need to infiltrate computers through a back door. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=719.8399999999999s)]
*  She says 95 percent of hacks today happen after a user clicks on a text, a link, or [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=724.92s)]
*  gives personal information over the phone. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=731.0799999999999s)]
*  You were able to hack my colleague Elizabeth, who is a tech savvy millennial. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=734.6s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=740.56s)]
*  Anybody can be hacked. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=742.76s)]
*  Anybody can fall for what Elizabeth fell for. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=744.2s)]
*  In fact, when I do that type of attack, every single time the person falls for it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=745.76s)]
*  She said hackers armed with basic information like a relative's name found online or an [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=750.84s)]
*  app that can mimic a voice or change the caller ID can create a convincing story. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=756.44s)]
*  If you were to receive a phone call, a text message, an email, and it's asking for something [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=762.7s)]
*  sensitive, urgent, or with fear, that's when the alarm bells have to go off in your head [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=767.08s)]
*  and they want me to give something to them. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=772.2s)]
*  I'm going to take a beat and I'm going to check that this person is who they say they [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=773.92s)]
*  are. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=777.4s)]
*  I call it being politely paranoid. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=778.4s)]
*  Politely paranoid. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=780.88s)]
*  Be politely paranoid. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=781.88s)]

*  He says their software can reroute scam calls away from grandparents. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=805.0s)]
*  If the parent is getting a call and we are identifying using AI that the call is a potential [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=810.24s)]
*  scam call, then they can route that call to me. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=816.38s)]
*  Does this stop the call from getting in? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=819.98s)]
*  It does. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  So it just blocks the call? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=822.9200000000001s)]
*  When the call comes in, it will have a recording that says, let me know who you are, what's [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=823.9200000000001s)]
*  your intent? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=829.5600000000001s)]
*  If it's an unknown person, if it's a known person that's already in your contacts, it'll [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=830.5999999999999s)]

*  And a lot of people in France cry because they feel that something very deep in the [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=984.2s)]
*  soul of France, in the spirit of France, was about to collapse. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=991.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, a heroic effort by the Paris Fire Brigade saved Notre Dame from collapse, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=999.76s)]
*  as a few staffers raced through falling embers to rescue precious relics. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1005.12s)]
*  Philippe Villeneuve, the cathedral's chief architect, was out of town that night and [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1011.44s)]
*  raced back to Paris. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1016.12s)]
*  He was devastated by what he saw. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1017.96s)]
*  I've said that the little boy who was in love with the cathedral and the architect who was [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1020.8000000000001s)]
*  in charge of it died that day. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1027.0s)]
*  And another man took over and said, I have to save the cathedral. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1029.44s)]
*  It's my mission. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1034.64s)]
*  It's my duty. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1035.76s)]
*  Villeneuve now shares that duty. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1037.56s)]
*  If he's the artist who knows every inch of stone in Notre Dame, retired army general [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1039.92s)]
*  Jorgelin is the commander, called back to meet that five-year deadline. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1045.72s)]
*  I will relax only when this will be done. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1050.68s)]
*  What does this cathedral mean to the people of France? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1055.08s)]
*  The cathedral, Notre Dame de Paris, is in some way the heart of France. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1059.1599999999999s)]
*  For the Catholic, of course, for the Christian, but for everybody. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1064.6s)]
*  All the great events of France in some way or another took place here in the cathedral. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1068.8s)]
*  Napoleon crowned himself emperor in Notre Dame in 1804. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1074.68s)]
*  In 1944, as Paris was liberated from Nazi occupation, General Charles de Gaulle braved [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1079.68s)]
*  sniper fire to enter the cathedral. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1086.28s)]
*  In many ways you could say that she's the people's palace. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1091.8s)]
*  Agnès Parier is a journalist and author who lives and works just across the river Seine [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1095.28s)]
*  from Notre Dame. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1100.88s)]
*  She and her neighbors watched the most horrifying moment the night of the fire, the collapse [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1102.3200000000002s)]
*  of that imposing spire. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1107.6399999999999s)]
*  I remember the scream of the crowd saying no, as if they couldn't, they couldn't conceive [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1113.12s)]
*  such a thing. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1120.6399999999999s)]
*  That spire meant so much to Philippe Villeneuve that he had it tattooed on his arm. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1122.48s)]
*  They say that I have Notre Dame in my skin, he told us. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1130.76s)]
*  It's very practical because when I have to explain how the spire fell, it's always better [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1134.48s)]
*  to show that from here to there it tipped over. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1140.32s)]
*  The huge spire made of oak and covered in lead tiles crashed through two of the stone [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1145.2s)]
*  vaults which formed the ceiling of Notre Dame, leaving gaping holes at the top and heaps [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1151.64s)]
*  of broken stone and charred wood on the floor below. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1157.16s)]
*  The top priority was to shore up the grand cathedral's weakened structure. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1163.24s)]
*  Huge temporary wooden supports were placed under the surviving stone vaults of her ceiling [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1169.8s)]
*  and under the flying buttresses to save this prime example of medieval engineering. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1175.04s)]
*  We have to check every stone in the cathedral, every pillar. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1181.36s)]
*  At the same time, a huge decontamination project was mounted to remove lead tiles that had [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1185.58s)]
*  melted from the burning roof and spire and all the toxic lead dust spread by the fire. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1191.84s)]
*  Four years on, workers still take extraordinary precautions against lead poisoning. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1198.56s)]
*  We had to wear disposable hazmat suits to enter the cathedral. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1203.8799999999999s)]
*  Tons of rubble had to be removed. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1208.6s)]
*  Paintings and stained glass windows were taken away for restoration and twisted steel scaffolding, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1211.58s)]
*  erected for ongoing restoration work, had to be dismantled. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1217.48s)]
*  So you were in the process of restoring the spire when the fire broke out in 2019. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1222.3600000000001s)]
*  Did your restoration project have anything to do with the fire breaking out? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1229.1200000000001s)]
*  An investigation is still underway, Philippe Villeneuve told us, and no cause of the fire [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1237.68s)]
*  has been identified, but personally, it's unbearable. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1243.0s)]
*  This fire never should have happened, and it did. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1247.52s)]
*  Inevitably, I feel responsible. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1250.64s)]
*  At that point in our interview, Villeneuve switched to English with a rueful smile. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1254.96s)]
*  In reality, I'm totally destroyed. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1260.64s)]
*  Really? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1265.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1266.64s)]
*  I so want to rebuild Notre Dame, it's because I want to rebuild myself. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1267.64s)]
*  The fire's deeply emotional impact on Philippe Villeneuve was mirrored around the world. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1275.92s)]
*  Nearly a billion dollars in private donations have been pledged to rebuild Notre Dame, most [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1284.4s)]
*  of it from France, 50 million dollars from Americans. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1290.1200000000001s)]
*  I know many people in the United States contributed. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1294.92s)]
*  They can contribute again. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1298.24s)]
*  They can continue to contribute. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1299.64s)]
*  The cash is always running. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1301.7600000000002s)]
*  If I want, give me money, I need. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1303.3600000000001s)]
*  In the weeks immediately following the fire, all sorts of ideas were floated for how centuries-old [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1305.64s)]
*  Notre Dame might be given a touch of avant-garde. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1311.8200000000002s)]
*  And all those architects throughout the world said, yes, let's have a roof garden, let's [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1316.3200000000002s)]
*  have a golden torch, let's have a titanium spire. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1320.72s)]
*  Even I, for 20 seconds, I thought, hmm, to add some 21st century genius to Notre Dame, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1325.96s)]
*  why not? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1332.68s)]
*  Chief architect Philippe Villeneuve had a very simple answer, why not? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1334.24s)]
*  An historic monument, a cathedral, is not something to be played with, he told us. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1341.76s)]
*  Notre Dame had been standing for 850 years with a wooden frame and a lead roof. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1347.28s)]
*  So wood is the way to go. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1353.56s)]
*  In the end, President Macron and a special committee agreed to rebuild Notre Dame exactly [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1356.3799999999999s)]
*  as she had been, and with the same materials, stone, wood and lead. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1362.56s)]
*  How is it that the traditionalists won out? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1369.52s)]
*  Well, I think wisdom won. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1372.56s)]
*  Notre Dame's signature spire was a fairly recent addition. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1377.2s)]
*  Images of the cathedral from the mid-1800s show her without a spire and in an advanced [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1381.28s)]
*  state of decay. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1387.04s)]
*  The cathedral was in great disrepair, was it not? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1388.72s)]
*  It was about to collapse, but of neglect, not of fire. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1392.5800000000002s)]
*  There were even proposals to demolish Notre Dame before the cathedral crumbled on its [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1397.0s)]
*  own. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1401.96s)]
*  Instead, the French government hired a young architect named Violet Leduc. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1403.72s)]
*  He created that famous spire. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1408.1200000000001s)]
*  So you are rebuilding the spire exactly as Violet Leduc? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1410.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1414.96s)]
*  Are you using his original drawings? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1415.96s)]
*  We were lucky, he said, because it was extremely well documented. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1420.46s)]
*  We have the drawings of Violet Leduc, the sketches, the surveys. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1424.6000000000001s)]
*  We have everything needed to be able to remake it. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1428.76s)]
*  A thousand French oak trees were felled for the new spire, then fine-cut by carpenters [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1433.36s)]
*  in eastern France. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1441.0s)]
*  In other workshops around the country, the cathedral's organ, the largest in France, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1442.6s)]
*  and many of its stained glass windows were restored. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1447.84s)]
*  How many workers and craftsmen do you have on this project? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1451.68s)]
*  If we take into account all the people in France, it's about 1,000 people. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1454.6s)]
*  On the plaza in front of Notre Dame, a huge tent has been erected, where stonecutters [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1462.84s)]
*  and sculptors are recreating Gothic gargoyles and adornments damaged in the fire. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1468.04s)]
*  Philippe Villeneuve supervises every detail. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1475.28s)]
*  I'll make them put their fingers on the layers of the original sculpture, he said, and then [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1478.88s)]
*  on the layer they're sculpting. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1488.3200000000002s)]
*  So he wants you to feel it, not just look at it. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1490.7600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1495.2800000000002s)]
*  And that works? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1496.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1497.2800000000002s)]
*  Dane LeBlanc is just 23 years old, sculpting and chiseling to recreate a floral detail [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1499.3200000000002s)]
*  carved hundreds of years ago. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1506.3600000000001s)]
*  We try to remake things identically, she said, but we are also trying to understand the intention [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1509.08s)]
*  of the original sculptors, so we look at the traces left by their tools. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1516.28s)]
*  We were given rare access to the painstaking restoration of Notre Dame as workers and artisans [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1523.8s)]
*  revived the cathedral's exterior and her interior. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1530.44s)]
*  The cathedral's great rose windows have been meticulously cleaned. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1538.32s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1543.48s)]
*  And every inch of stone coated with latex, which, when peeled away, leaves the surface [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1546.08s)]
*  gleaming. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1551.96s)]
*  We found restorers, Mathilde Maire and Aude Massimi, working on painted stone sculptures, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1554.8s)]
*  depicting scenes from the life of Christ. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1561.6399999999999s)]
*  How old is this? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1564.6599999999999s)]
*  This part of the cathedral, she said, was built at the beginning of the 14th century. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1567.24s)]
*  These sculptures are medieval. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1575.28s)]
*  The restorers are carefully wiping every surface with small cotton swabs dipped in a water-based [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1578.64s)]
*  cleaning solution. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1584.92s)]
*  So I think you have to have a lot of patience. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1586.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1589.68s)]
*  Yes, she says, you have to be calm and know that it will take time, but it's a pleasure. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1591.68s)]
*  You can see she's wiping away the sentries. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1598.68s)]
*  A 600-ton maze of scaffolding has been built inside Notre Dame to support all the work, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1601.68s)]

*  General Georges Lannes took us up through it, two-thirds of the way on a construction elevator. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1612.6000000000001s)]
*  We reached the top climbing steps and ladders. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1620.16s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1624.0400000000002s)]
*  We were standing 100 feet above the cathedral floor, in exactly the spot where the flaming [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1625.6200000000001s)]
*  spire collapsed. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1631.5600000000002s)]
*  Four years ago, there was nothing here but a vast hole. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1633.5600000000002s)]
*  The drama took place here, and we have to rebuild the vault of the transept. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1637.52s)]
*  The spire will be there, 66 meters high. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1642.76s)]
*  At the top of the old 200-foot spire sat a copper sculpture of a rooster, the symbol [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1648.1s)]
*  of the French people. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1653.6599999999999s)]
*  The day after the fire, Philippe Villeneuve found it on a lower roof, a bit mangled but [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1655.1799999999998s)]
*  miraculously untouched by the flames. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1661.02s)]
*  It has been left as it was found and will be put on display in the restored cathedral. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1664.24s)]
*  Can I tell you, Villeneuve says, that I plan to put a new rooster on top of a new spire [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1671.4199999999998s)]
*  one year to the day before the reopening of the cathedral. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1677.14s)]
*  There will still be scaffolding, but the frame of the spire will again be in the sky of Paris. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1681.26s)]
*  And the spire will rest on these four pillars, you see here. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1688.26s)]
*  It will be magnificent. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1697.26s)]
*  Magnificent, yes, for the glory of God and France. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1699.26s)]
*  General Jean-Louis Georges Laine, who led the effort to reconstruct Notre Dame for more [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1704.26s)]

*  In December, nearly every member country of the United Nations pledged to protect at least [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1734.26s)]
*  30 percent of the world's land and sea by 2030 to reverse the damage done by humans [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1748.06s)]
*  and protect vulnerable species. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1753.78s)]

*  As we first told you earlier this year, they have brains six times larger than ours and [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1765.98s)]
*  spend most of their lives in the darkest depths of the ocean. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1770.8200000000002s)]
*  It is difficult to describe their size without comparing them to a school bus. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1774.5s)]
*  We traveled with National Geographic explorer Enrique Sala to the Caribbean island of Dominica, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1779.18s)]
*  where he's proposing protections for the hundreds of sperm whales living there. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1784.98s)]
*  But first, we had to find them. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1789.14s)]
*  You guys ready? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1792.66s)]
*  Go, go, go! [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1793.66s)]
*  Go, go! [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1794.66s)]
*  Go guys, go! [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1795.66s)]
*  Look in the water, coming straight to you, yeah! [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1796.66s)]
*  Most of Enrique Sala's dives don't start like a fire drill, even though he has spent thousands [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1799.66s)]
*  of hours underwater as an explorer. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1804.5800000000002s)]
*  Look down. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1806.66s)]
*  At the back of you, look! [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1807.66s)]
*  This way! [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1808.66s)]
*  This way! [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1809.66s)]
*  We came face to face with a pod of whales, but these are not the whales we traveled all [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1810.66s)]
*  this way to see. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1815.18s)]
*  They are pygmy killer whales, known to threaten sperm whales. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1816.88s)]
*  And because they are here, the sperm whales are not. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1820.58s)]
*  These killer whales can grow up to eight and a half feet in size. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1824.6599999999999s)]
*  Sala told us seeing them up close almost never happens. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1829.02s)]
*  You've never been able to get into the water with one of these. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1833.1399999999999s)]
*  They're that elusive. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1834.86s)]
*  They are very elusive. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1835.86s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1837.26s)]
*  Why do you not see them? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1838.26s)]
*  They are very smart. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1839.26s)]
*  They hunt like wolves. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1840.26s)]
*  They hunt in groups. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1841.26s)]
*  And they don't care about interacting with humans. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1842.26s)]
*  They are after the prey. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1844.3s)]
*  We were off the coast of Dominica, a country in the Eastern Caribbean. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1846.68s)]
*  Residents call it Nature Island. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1852.52s)]
*  Those rainforest-covered volcanic peaks drop thousands of feet down to the seafloor below, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1854.5800000000002s)]
*  which is why hundreds of sperm whales live in these waters. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1860.52s)]
*  They are one of the deepest diving mammals on the planet. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1864.28s)]
*  They are mostly females here, families made up of grandmothers, mothers and daughters [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1868.3600000000001s)]
*  who stay together for life, nursing and raising their young. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1873.24s)]
*  When Enrique Sala was here in December, his National Geographic team filmed this. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1877.56s)]
*  It is a pod of sleeping female sperm whales, vertical giants up to 40 feet long, suspended [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1883.72s)]
*  near the surface. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1890.26s)]
*  Their nap lasts only about 15 minutes until the whales are ready to dive again in what [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1891.8s)]
*  can be an hour-long journey for squid thousands of feet down. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1897.08s)]
*  According to researchers, why they sleep like this is one of the great mysteries. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1901.72s)]
*  What's it like to be in the water with them? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1906.76s)]
*  Magical. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1908.92s)]
*  We have in our minds the legend of Moby Dick, these nasty aggressive animals. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1910.02s)]
*  But you jump in the water and they are so docile and gentle. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1915.08s)]
*  They have never attacked humans. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1919.14s)]
*  And they are so curious, especially the babies. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1921.38s)]
*  So it's one of the most amazing wildlife encounters that one can have on the planet. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1923.64s)]
*  Your official title is Explorer in Residence. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1929.84s)]
*  Not bad. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1932.6399999999999s)]
*  That's an oxymoron. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1933.6399999999999s)]
*  Explorers are not supposed to be in this. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1934.6399999999999s)]
*  True. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1936.84s)]
*  You're not supposed to be sitting in one place. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1937.84s)]
*  What does that mean to be an explorer in the year 2023? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1939.8799999999999s)]
*  Very different from what an explorer of the 19th century was. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1942.78s)]
*  I can dedicate my life and work with an amazing team of scientists, policy experts, filmmakers, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1947.04s)]
*  storytellers to work with local communities, governments, indigenous peoples, to assess [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1954.0s)]
*  the health of ocean places and help to protect them. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1958.84s)]
*  He grew up north of Barcelona, Spain, near the coast. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1964.12s)]
*  His first dive was in a marine reserve. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1967.1599999999999s)]
*  It drove everything that I have done afterwards. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1969.84s)]
*  If we give the ocean space, it can heal itself. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1972.24s)]
*  Salah moved to California, where he was a professor of marine ecology for seven years [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1977.76s)]
*  at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1982.3s)]
*  You have had a long career in academia at a top university, and you tried that and decided [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1985.8s)]
*  not for me. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1992.04s)]
*  You walked away. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1993.04s)]
*  I walked away because my job was to study the impacts of humans in the ocean, the impacts [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1994.04s)]
*  of fishing and global warming. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=1998.8s)]
*  And one day I realized that all I was doing was writing the obituary of the ocean. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2000.6s)]
*  Writing the obituary of the ocean. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2004.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2006.32s)]
*  I felt like the doctor who's telling you how you're going to die with excruciating detail, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2007.32s)]
*  but not offering a cure. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2011.08s)]
*  Have you found that cure? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2013.04s)]
*  There is one solution that is proven. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2014.24s)]
*  It's a success story everywhere in the world, which is marine reserves or marine protected [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2017.72s)]
*  areas, areas where damaging activities are banned and marine life can come back. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2022.0s)]
*  He founded the Pristine Seas Project in 2008. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2028.92s)]
*  It combines sea exploration, scientific research and public policy, and has worked with 17 [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2033.08s)]
*  to turn these large swaths of the ocean into marine protected areas. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2039.56s)]
*  In Dominica, scientists estimate the sperm whale population declines by 3% each year. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2046.6s)]
*  Salas says a preserve would protect them from their greatest threats, not those pygmy killer [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2054.12s)]
*  whales we saw or whaling, which has been banned for decades, but plastic trash, ocean noise [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2059.2s)]
*  pollution and ship strikes. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2065.56s)]
*  If they continue with the status quo here, what happens? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2068.36s)]
*  If nothing is done, the population will probably continue declining. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2071.88s)]
*  So reducing those threats, hopefully, will allow the sperm whale population to rebound. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2075.7200000000003s)]
*  And the more whales there are, the more benefits Dominica and the local communities will obtain. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2081.92s)]
*  Hurricane Maria devastated those communities in 2017. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2088.48s)]
*  Today the island is continuing to rebuild and prepare for the future. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2094.08s)]
*  Francine Barron heads the agency in charge of that effort. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2099.48s)]
*  What was it about Hurricane Maria that made the leaders of this country say we have to [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2103.2000000000003s)]
*  do something, we really have to act? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2107.28s)]
*  We suffered the equivalent of 226% loss of GDP. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2110.0s)]
*  So we could see the trend and we realized that we needed to become much more resilient. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2113.92s)]
*  When Enrique Salas came to you with this idea of creating a sanctuary for these whales, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2120.88s)]
*  what was his pitch to you? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2126.4s)]
*  We see whale watching as an important part of our tourism product and it's something [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2127.92s)]
*  that needs to be protected. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2133.6s)]
*  And the idea of creating greater protection for the whales is something that Dominica [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2135.6800000000003s)]
*  is very open to and we were very pleased with the suggestion that Enrique made to creating [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2141.2400000000002s)]
*  a recognized sanctuary for the whales. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2147.72s)]
*  Enrique Salas compares it to a model that has worked in Rwanda, where protecting mountain [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2151.0s)]
*  gorillas helped bring tourism dollars to the local economy. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2155.9599999999996s)]
*  You going to find us some whales? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2160.8799999999997s)]
*  Sure. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2163.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2164.0s)]
*  Captain Kurt Benoit was born and raised in Dominica and has been in the whale tourism [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2165.0s)]
*  business for more than two decades. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2168.3999999999996s)]
*  He set out on his 38-foot lady rose from a small fishing village on the West Coast. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2172.04s)]
*  Our government permit to swim with the whales was good for six days. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2178.92s)]
*  Captain Benoit uses a homemade device that picks up the distinct clicking of sperm whales [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2185.56s)]
*  as far as 11 miles away. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2190.36s)]
*  We got whales in the south. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2192.72s)]
*  Every three miles, we checked to see if we were getting closer. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2194.82s)]
*  It's come to papa. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2198.28s)]
*  Daddy's here. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2200.84s)]
*  Tell me about this really high-tech device you've got here. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2202.44s)]
*  You have an underwater microphone which picks up sound from 360. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2205.44s)]
*  So what I did, I take a salad bowl with neoprene. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2209.32s)]
*  So the hydrophone is kind of hidden. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2212.2400000000002s)]
*  So as it goes out, it actually brings you straight to wherever you hear the sound. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2214.0400000000004s)]
*  So this is a salad bowl from your house? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2218.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2220.5600000000004s)]
*  What do the whales sound like? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2221.5600000000004s)]
*  It's like a horse is galloping on a hot surface. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2224.1600000000003s)]
*  So if we have several of them, that means there's a lot of whales there. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2226.64s)]
*  Let's keep them going, man. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2232.0s)]
*  I'm going to find these guys. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2233.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2234.0s)]
*  On the second day, a water spout. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2235.0s)]
*  See it? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2237.0s)]
*  It's right here. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2238.0s)]
*  Look, guys. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2239.0s)]
*  See him? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2240.0s)]
*  You can see its top. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2241.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2242.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2243.0s)]
*  No! [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2244.0s)]
*  Swimmers in the water. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2245.0s)]
*  Males here live with their families until their teen years. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2246.52s)]
*  Then they roam mostly alone, swimming thousands of miles away. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2249.72s)]
*  Caribbean male sperm whales have been found as far away as Norway, returning here only [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2253.96s)]
*  to mate. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2259.8s)]
*  Our cameraman got lucky enough or unlucky enough to have the whale poop on him. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2265.12s)]
*  So the whales go down, they hunt squid, they come back to the surface, they breathe, they [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2271.4s)]
*  rest and they poop. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2276.84s)]
*  And that poop is full of nutrients, which fertilizes the shallow waters. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2279.0s)]
*  So a good thing, I guess. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2284.96s)]
*  It's a good thing. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2286.6s)]
*  Come on, people. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2287.6s)]
*  We're looking for spouts. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2288.6s)]
*  But our luck didn't last. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2290.84s)]
*  Okay, guys, nothing is here. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2292.64s)]
*  We spent the next day searching for sperm whales and the next... [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2294.46s)]
*  Nothing at all? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2299.2s)]
*  Nothing at all. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2300.2s)]
*  And the next, not a single click. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2301.2s)]
*  You guys, it's pretty quiet. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2304.84s)]
*  And then, in the last hour of the last day of our trip... [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2306.84s)]
*  We have lots of animals in the area, guys. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2311.0s)]
*  They're coming back. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2314.44s)]
*  But I'm getting songs 360. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2319.0s)]
*  So that means the whales, we are above them. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2321.52s)]
*  We're right there. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2324.2400000000002s)]
*  Go, go! [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2325.2400000000002s)]
*  And stay there, it's coming to you! [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2326.2400000000002s)]
*  They're still here. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2327.2400000000002s)]
*  It's coming to you! [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2328.2400000000002s)]
*  It's coming to you! [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2329.2400000000002s)]
*  It's coming to you! [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2330.2400000000002s)]
*  It's coming to you! [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2331.2400000000002s)]
*  It's coming to you! [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2332.2400000000002s)]
*  It's coming to you! [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2333.2400000000002s)]
*  It's coming to you! [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2334.2400000000002s)]
*  It's coming to you! [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2335.2400000000002s)]
*  It's coming to you! [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2336.24s)]
*  It's coming to you! [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2337.24s)]
*  We jumped in the water and a young female swam right to us. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2338.24s)]
*  She came within feet. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2342.04s)]
*  At first, her size was terrifying. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2343.8399999999997s)]
*  She made a sound like a creaking door hinge. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2349.2799999999997s)]
*  It's one of the ways whales communicate and socialize. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2352.0s)]
*  With eyes on the side of her head, she stared right at us. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2356.04s)]
*  She had squid in her mouth, left over from lunch thousands of feet below. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2362.82s)]
*  She stayed and rolled around and her jaw was wide open. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2369.8s)]
*  She was using echolocation, bouncing those clicks off of us, trying to figure out what [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2373.9s)]
*  we were. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2379.1400000000003s)]
*  You could hear the clicking. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2383.8s)]
*  You could hear her. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2384.98s)]
*  You could hear it in your bones. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2385.98s)]
*  Once you were really close to her, you could hear that so loudly. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2386.98s)]
*  I could feel it in my bones. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2389.98s)]
*  You grabbed my hand, you could tell I was nervous. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2392.06s)]
*  I was excited too. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2393.9s)]
*  You were? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2395.38s)]
*  They are huge. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2396.38s)]
*  You have to respect them. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2397.86s)]
*  You have to respect them. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2398.86s)]
*  There is a sense of awe that comes with being in there. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2400.18s)]
*  She was looking right at us. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2402.62s)]
*  And she left us a souvenir. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2404.8s)]
*  Piece of squid. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2407.2200000000003s)]
*  Sperm whales live in... [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2408.62s)]
*  Shane Giro is another National Geographic explorer. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2409.78s)]
*  He started the Dominica Sperm Whale Project and over the past 18 years, he's identified [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2413.62s)]
*  more than 35 families. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2418.9s)]
*  Did you recognize the whale that we saw? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2421.46s)]
*  The animal you met belongs to the EC2 clan, the other clan of whales that we've known [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2424.7s)]
*  exists in the Caribbean, but we haven't seen all that much. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2430.42s)]
*  And those groups identify themselves by making specific patterns of clicks called codas. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2433.38s)]
*  It's a part of who they are, where their grandmother grew up, and so it really ties the animals [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2440.3s)]
*  and the place together. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2445.02s)]
*  What does the coda of the EC2 sound like? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2446.78s)]
*  They make the 5R3 coda, and it sounds like this. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2450.42s)]
*  Five slow clicks. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2454.58s)]
*  And she came up to you and made this 5R3 coda, saying, I am from the EC2 clan, are you? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2460.7000000000003s)]
*  She was rolling around and she kept coming back, but is that me assigning human characteristics [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2468.38s)]
*  to a whale, or is she actually a playful animal? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2474.06s)]
*  These are the animals that are holding the largest brain to ever exist, maybe in the [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2478.06s)]
*  universe. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2482.5s)]
*  And they use that for complicated thinking and behavior. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2483.5s)]
*  Absolutely, this was an animal that was playful. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2488.22s)]
*  And that curiosity of the animal actively coming towards you just shows that this is [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2491.22s)]
*  an animal that's investigating something in its world. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2495.86s)]
*  Back on the dock, Enrique Salas says it's that world he's trying to protect. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2500.62s)]
*  Being in the water with sperm whales is a magical experience. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2508.2200000000003s)]
*  There's something spiritual there. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2510.6200000000003s)]
*  This is more than science and data. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2511.6200000000003s)]
*  Sense of awe and wonder that is unavoidable when you are in the water with these gentle [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2516.42s)]
*  giants. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja_0FBkTwBA&t=2521.38s)]
