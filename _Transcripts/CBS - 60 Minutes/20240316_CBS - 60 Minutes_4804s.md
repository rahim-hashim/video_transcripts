# The U.S.-China rivalry, Taiwan and Hong Kong | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [March 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI)
*  American CEOs used to swoon over China. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=0.0s)]
*  Its vast pool of consumers has been a magnetic draw for decades. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=17.12s)]
*  But doing business there has become so fraught and risky, with intellectual property theft [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=22.3s)]
*  and an expanded espionage law used to intimidate the business community [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=28.66s)]
*  that U.S. companies have pressed the pause button. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=34.1s)]
*  On top of that, the U.S.-China relationship has become contentious, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=37.74s)]
*  due partly to Beijing's belligerent activity toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=42.38s)]
*  the balloon spy incident of last year, and the list goes on. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=49.3s)]
*  Making matters worse, the Chinese economy has hit a wall. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=54.339999999999996s)]
*  Export growth is slowing. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=59.42s)]
*  The country's drowning in debt and youth unemployment has soared. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=61.5s)]
*  Getting into China to tell that story is all but impossible for most Western journalists. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=67.38s)]
*  But when the U.S. Ambassador, Nicholas Burns, invited us to come for a visit and an interview, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=74.42s)]
*  we were granted visas. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=80.9s)]
*  We spoke with him at his residence in Beijing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=82.94s)]
*  More money is leaving China for the first time in 40 years than is coming in from American, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=86.86s)]
*  Japanese, European, Korean investors. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  Now, why is that and how much of a problem is that for them? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=97.14s)]
*  That's a real problem for this economy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=101.5s)]
*  They have 1.4 billion people here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=103.86s)]
*  They've got to keep it growing, and foreign capital is important. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=105.66s)]
*  You ask why. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=109.46s)]
*  I think there's been a contradiction in the messaging from the government here in China [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  to the rest of the world. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  On the one hand, they say, we're open for business. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=116.97999999999999s)]
*  We want American, Japanese businesses here. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=119.66s)]
*  But on the other hand, they've raided six or seven American businesses since last March. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=123.14s)]
*  Raided? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=129.34s)]
*  Raided. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=130.06s)]
*  They've gone into American companies and shut them down and made accusations we believe are very much unwarranted. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=131.26s)]
*  The American companies include Bain & Company and the Mintz Group, a company that does due [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=138.86s)]
*  diligence for other companies that might want to invest here, was raided last year. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=146.02s)]
*  Five of its Chinese employees were taken into custody and they're still there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=151.78s)]
*  Another firm, Cat Vision, was raided. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=157.62s)]
*  Lest the message wasn't loud and clear, a report about it was put on state-run television. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=160.58s)]
*  It accused Western consulting firms of espionage and stealing national security and military secrets. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=168.34s)]
*  They want the investment to come back, and they're raiding American companies? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=176.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=180.62s)]
*  They've passed an amendment to their counter-espionage law, and it's written in such a general way that it could be that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=181.26s)]
*  American business people could be accused of espionage for engaging in practices that are perfectly legal and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=188.9s)]
*  acceptable everywhere else in the world, collecting data to do due diligence so that you can decide whether you want [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=196.78s)]
*  to invest in a company or form a joint venture, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=203.14000000000001s)]
*  What do you think the Chinese are afraid that these companies are going to find out, these due diligence companies? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=206.26s)]
*  What are they worrying about? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=214.26s)]
*  You know, I think they want to control data about the Chinese people, about Chinese companies. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=215.22s)]
*  And so that, I think, is at the heart of the problem with those American companies operating in that sphere. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=220.74s)]
*  Ambassador Burns told us that's just one of the concerns he hears about. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=226.38s)]
*  There is still intellectual property theft from American companies here. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=231.18s)]
*  Is every American company afraid of that? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=235.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=238.82s)]
*  All kinds of U.S. companies began flocking to China in the early 1980s after the country opened to the West under then leader Deng Xiaoping. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=239.9s)]
*  And now U.S. banks operate here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=251.02s)]
*  Walmart has more than 300 stores across the country. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=254.5s)]
*  Shoppers here in Shanghai can buy Levi's, browse in an Apple store and get a caramel frappuccino. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=258.94s)]
*  Starbucks has 6,000 stores in China, a thousand stores in Shanghai, and they want to keep building because coffee. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=268.38s)]
*  This was a tea culture for hundreds of years. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=276.94s)]
*  It's now becoming, at least with the young Chinese, a coffee culture. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=280.18s)]
*  And they love Starbucks? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=284.02s)]
*  They love Starbucks and I'll buy you a cappuccino. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  I'll take one. Thank you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=288.18s)]
*  Boeing's here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=290.18s)]
*  So is Tesla, Pfizer, Chevron, Intel. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=291.38s)]
*  But while some businesses are thriving, many of the foreign companies are worried about the business climate under President Xi Jinping. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=296.02s)]
*  If you track China from the death of Mao to the opening of China to the world, we've seen a closing of sorts. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=304.34s)]
*  We've seen a centralization of power of the party. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=313.78s)]
*  We've seen increased repression of the people of China here. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=316.82s)]
*  That's a very significant trend just over the last decade. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=321.41999999999996s)]
*  With Xi? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=325.41999999999996s)]
*  Under his leadership. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=326.53999999999996s)]
*  Part of that trend includes President Xi's reversing many of the market reforms that unleashed China's economic miracle. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=327.58s)]
*  They've been growing over 40 years, the fastest growth rate in recorded economic history. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=337.26s)]
*  Eight, nine, ten, eleven percent growth rates. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=341.9s)]
*  They've lifted eight hundred million people out of poverty. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=345.14s)]
*  But what's happening is that growth rate is slowing down. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=347.94s)]
*  Most economists are now projecting there'll be a two, three, four percent growth, maybe even lower in the next decade. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=350.82s)]
*  Can they support their society if it's that low? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=357.34s)]
*  That's going to be difficult for them. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=359.7s)]
*  If there was so much explosive growth, if so many people were lifted out of poverty, why is he turning away from what worked? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=361.38s)]
*  Well, I think they've got maybe competing priorities. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=371.46s)]
*  The government here in China certainly wants the economy to grow, but they also have a national security mindset. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=375.26s)]
*  They want to control data. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=381.34s)]
*  They want to... [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=383.46s)]
*  But that's more important, the control, right, than economic growth. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=384.14s)]
*  It seems that way. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=389.02s)]
*  I think it's open for debate. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=390.3s)]
*  You're hearing, we are hearing both messages. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=392.3s)]
*  It sounds as if you yourself don't know the direction it's going. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=395.38s)]
*  What I perceive here is that the greater energy is with those on the national security side of the government of China. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=400.29999999999995s)]
*  Good morning. How are you? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=408.17999999999995s)]
*  On a train trip from Beijing to Shanghai, the ambassador pointed out that in the decades before President Xi, China powered its economy by investing in these high speed trains, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=409.46s)]
*  roads, factories and skyscrapers that light up Shanghai, the financial capital of China. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=424.02s)]
*  But under President Xi, China lost more than $120 billion worth of long term foreign investments last year because of the weakening economy and the harsh government tactics, which have left American companies uncertain of the future there. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=432.58s)]
*  There are a lot of American companies here, have a lot of them just picked up and left because of this current business environment. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=449.53999999999996s)]
*  You know, that's interesting. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=457.06s)]
*  Not many. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=458.62s)]
*  Not many. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=459.65999999999997s)]
*  Not many. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=460.38s)]
*  Why not? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=460.97999999999996s)]
*  China is the second largest economy in the world. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=462.34s)]
*  It's a big market. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=464.97999999999996s)]
*  So a few American companies have left, but most have stayed. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=465.65999999999997s)]
*  Some American companies are moving at least some of their operations to Singapore, Vietnam, Mexico. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=470.7s)]
*  But they're not leaving China. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=478.54s)]
*  The market is so irresistible to American business people. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=480.82s)]
*  It's gigantic. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=485.34000000000003s)]
*  Maybe they're not leaving, but they're not investing. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=486.98s)]
*  They're not making major investments until they can see exactly where the government is headed. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=490.02000000000004s)]
*  Yet because of the $1.4 billion potential consumers, some companies like Disney are increasing their investment. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=495.18s)]
*  Welcome to Shanghai Disney Resort. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=504.42s)]
*  It recently expanded its Shanghai Disneyland that they told us is thriving. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=507.06s)]
*  Aptar, a $9 billion company headquartered in Crystal Lake, Illinois, is another American firm bucking the trend of capital flight. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=514.34s)]
*  President of Aptar Asia, Shangwei Gong, a Chinese-born U.S. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=524.38s)]
*  citizen, showed us around one of their five manufacturing sites in China. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=529.74s)]
*  We are manufacturing for some of the largest U.S. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=535.22s)]
*  brands, actually U.S. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=539.38s)]
*  consumer brands. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=540.5s)]
*  This factory makes the packaging and dispensing devices for food, pharmaceutical and beauty products sold in Asia. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=542.02s)]
*  All of our customers like P&G, L'Oreal, Esselada, they're all here doing business. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=550.78s)]
*  Aptar, in China for nearly 30 years, recently invested $60 million in a new factory. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=557.18s)]
*  Shangwei Gong says even in a slowing economy, the company is doing well. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=565.3399999999999s)]
*  American companies here, as the ambassador well knows, are pausing or cutting back on investment. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=571.38s)]
*  But not this firm. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=577.86s)]
*  You're expanding. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=579.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, because we are here for the long term and we believe in the consumption power of the rising middle class. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=580.86s)]
*  It's 1.4 billion people here. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=588.86s)]
*  And imagine, for example, health care and the same with cosmetics and beauty and beverage, all those sectors, packaged foods. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=591.1800000000001s)]
*  These are really the biggest markets. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=599.9000000000001s)]
*  And so we are very confident about the long term. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=602.0200000000001s)]
*  What does it say about the confidence, really, in the U.S.-China relationship? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=605.3s)]
*  It seems to say you believe that that things will, what? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=612.26s)]
*  I'm asking, get better? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=616.98s)]
*  That's a great question for the ambassador. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=620.3s)]
*  I believe so. I hope so. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=623.26s)]
*  You know, we'll see. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=625.5s)]
*  Actually, Byrne says he's wary of the future as the fundamental rivalry and mistrust between the U.S. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=626.9399999999999s)]
*  and China is shaking the confidence of the business world and has pushed our relationship to its lowest point in half a century. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=634.3s)]
*  Is it our most competitive relationship in the world right now? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=643.9799999999999s)]
*  This is the most important, most competitive and most dangerous relationship that the United States has in the world right now and will, I think, for the next decade or so. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=648.9s)]
*  I want to quote you back to you and tell us what you meant. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=658.9399999999999s)]
*  You have said divorce is not an option. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=663.14s)]
*  Right. Our two countries have to live together. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=667.26s)]
*  And this, I think, is the greatest tension in the U.S.-China relationship. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=670.22s)]
*  China is our most significant competitor. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=674.82s)]
*  And at the same time, China is our third largest trade partner. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=677.94s)]
*  Seven hundred and fifty thousand American jobs at stake. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=682.26s)]
*  Agriculture. China is the largest market for U.S. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=685.3000000000001s)]
*  One fifth of all of our export products from agriculture are sent to China. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=689.34s)]
*  That was forty point nine billion dollars last year. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=695.5s)]
*  So we can't afford, really, to have a real break here. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=699.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, it's complicated. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=702.86s)]
*  All those jobs would... [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=703.82s)]
*  It's complicated. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=705.02s)]
*  Some people are saying, well, we're so competitive with China, we should end the economic relationship. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=706.3s)]
*  Well, the consequences of that would be seven hundred and fifty thousand American families wouldn't be able to put dinner on the table. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=710.58s)]
*  And so this makes for an extraordinarily difficult balancing act in my job. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=717.82s)]
*  You're a Walinda brother. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=723.74s)]
*  I've never thought of myself that way, but high wire. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=725.66s)]
*  Well, we have competing interests here. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=729.1800000000001s)]
*  And balancing those interests is the reality in the U.S.-China relationship. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=731.9s)]
*  We're going to compete. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=736.1s)]
*  We have to compete responsibly and keep the peace between our countries. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=737.02s)]
*  But we also have to engage. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=741.1800000000001s)]
*  More about the balancing act and the biggest economic problem in China today when we come back. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=742.7800000000001s)]
*  One in every five people in the world is Chinese. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=757.5s)]
*  China's population is four times that of the U.S. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=761.46s)]
*  And the country is vast, three point seven million square miles. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=765.3000000000001s)]
*  It overlooks the Taiwan Strait, where half the world's trade flows every day and is located about a hundred miles away from Taiwan. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=770.06s)]
*  President Xi likes to say that the East is rising, the West is declining. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=781.3399999999999s)]
*  But economically, the U.S. is thriving compared to China. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=787.14s)]
*  In December, Moody's, the credit rating agency, cut its outlook for China to negative. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=791.9799999999999s)]
*  And it's facing a long-term demographic bind, a decline in the birthrate that experts say is irreversible, meaning the country is both aging and shrinking. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=797.9s)]
*  Ambassador Nicholas Burns took us on a tour starting in Beijing. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=810.26s)]
*  The ambassador and his wife, Libby, like to take early morning walks through a park near their residence. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=818.82s)]
*  This is a 600-year-old Ming dynasty park called Ritan Park. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=825.22s)]
*  It's a place for a lot of retirees and a lot of young people, and it's tremendously active. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=829.14s)]
*  It's where the locals come for their early morning routines, like Tai Chi, yoyoing and ping pong. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=835.14s)]
*  You couldn't tell from these scenes that China, where the COVID pandemic began, is still emerging from the trauma of President Xi Jinping's oppressive zero-COVID policy. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=845.7s)]
*  Burns says that the Chinese government is still in the process of finding a way to deal with the pandemic. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=859.22s)]
*  The Chinese government, which is still in the process of finding a way to deal with the pandemic, is still in the process of finding a way to deal with the pandemic. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=867.14s)]
*  Burns, 68, a career diplomat who has served in both Republican and Democratic administrations, got to China at the height of the zero-COVID lockdowns and quarantines. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=874.34s)]
*  When my wife, Libby, and I arrived here in early March of 2022, we were quarantined in this house for 21 days, for three weeks. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=888.5s)]
*  Shanghai, a city of 26 million people, was completely locked down for 63 days. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=896.98s)]
*  What was that like in the city? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=903.7800000000001s)]
*  We had women who needed to give birth, and we had to find a way to get them to the hospital. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=906.58s)]
*  We had Americans who wanted to get out but had to find a way out of their locked compounds to the airport. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=911.3000000000001s)]
*  So zero-COVID worked for a while. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=918.2600000000001s)]
*  In 2020 and 2021, they had very low or relatively lower infection rates, but by 2022, it had really divided this society. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=920.98s)]
*  It set off rare, widespread protests. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=929.62s)]
*  Then in December of 2022, President Xi ended the policy abruptly. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=933.22s)]
*  The last thing this government is going to accept here is volatility. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=939.4599999999999s)]
*  Volatility is something Jörg Woodga, a German businessman who's lived and worked in China for over 30 years, hadn't seen since the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=943.38s)]
*  He represents BASF, the world's largest chemical producer. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=956.5s)]
*  You have said this is a PTSD country, post-traumatic stress disorder country. What do you mean? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=962.26s)]
*  Well, everybody has been traumatized by the lockdowns that took place in many cities across China. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=969.94s)]
*  The kind of messaging that came out of the leadership is for your own safety. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=975.86s)]
*  Then the lockdown was lifted. Actually, it was more a capitulation from the government. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=980.1800000000001s)]
*  The lockdown basically left and like a tsunami... [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=984.6600000000001s)]
*  They said we were wrong, we're going to lift it? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=987.86s)]
*  They never said they were wrong. That's not the system. Admit that they did something wrong. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=989.62s)]
*  Then basically, like a tsunami, COVID was rolling across the country. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=993.62s)]
*  After they lifted it? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=998.1s)]
*  December, January, I would say a billion people were infected and certainly lots of people died. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=999.7800000000001s)]
*  Independent analysts say that an estimated 1.4 million people died. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1005.7s)]
*  This kind of environment really changes your attitude towards life. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1011.7s)]
*  And in business, we thought we're going to have a comeback story and we had a good couple of weeks and then the economy basically has been flat since. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1015.22s)]
*  You know, after COVID in the West, in the United States particularly, we did have a huge quick rebound. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1023.86s)]
*  Why didn't it happen here? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1031.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, I think that COVID also has covered up a couple of long-term problems that China has been building up. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1033.46s)]
*  For example, in the real estate sector. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1038.66s)]
*  We reported on the real estate sector 10 years ago with astonishing sites like this of empty buildings in city after city across the country. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1041.14s)]
*  This is today. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1051.8600000000001s)]
*  Similar hollowed out wastelands of unoccupied and unfinished apartments known as ghost cities. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1054.42s)]
*  When I was here 10 years ago, I never expected to see these buildings still here. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1062.42s)]
*  But was a housing bubble back then grew and finally exploded? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1068.66s)]
*  This real estate crisis lies at the heart of China's economic decline. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1075.38s)]
*  Has anybody counted up the number of empty units? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1081.38s)]
*  I mean, across the whole country? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1086.5s)]
*  Well, the whole of Germany, we have 82 million people could move in here right away. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1088.3400000000001s)]
*  80 to 90 million apartments are empty. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1092.1000000000001s)]
*  80 to 90 million apartments are empty. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1095.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1099.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm finished. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1100.1000000000001s)]
*  Over the years, Chinese banks readily loan money to the developers as the building boom created millions of jobs and [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1101.5400000000002s)]
*  propelled China's growth. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1110.42s)]
*  But in 2020, the government under President Xi clamped down on the rampant borrowing, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1112.74s)]
*  causing the major developers to default on their loans and run out of money. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1119.14s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1124.66s)]
*  The facade isn't even finished. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1125.22s)]
*  He says they couldn't even afford to take down the cranes. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1127.8600000000001s)]
*  In January, Evergrande, once China's largest developer, was ordered to liquidate its remaining assets. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1132.5s)]
*  Left in the lurch are millions of Chinese citizens who bought these apartments before they were built. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1140.66s)]
*  The developers owe their customers that paid up to the magnitude of one trillion US dollars. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1147.7s)]
*  So if I did a down payment on one of these apartments, will I ever see that money? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1154.02s)]
*  No, you will not see the money. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1160.8200000000002s)]
*  It's gone. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1162.26s)]
*  It's finished. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1162.74s)]
*  So it's really dramatic. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1163.94s)]
*  Ten years ago, we were told that this was the way people put money down for their nest egg. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1166.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1172.98s)]
*  For their retirement fund. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1173.54s)]
*  Is that still the case? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1175.46s)]
*  The 66 percent, two-third of a family household average wealth is in apartments. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1176.74s)]
*  That loss of wealth has depressed consumer spending and dragged down the economy. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1183.54s)]
*  We wondered if the people blamed President Xi for that or for the COVID deaths. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1189.78s)]
*  But it was impossible for us to gauge public opinion or if it even matters. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1195.6200000000001s)]
*  While no one from the government would give us an interview, we were able to learn, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1200.98s)]
*  as Jörg Wittke, who's lived here for 30 years, told us, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1205.7s)]
*  it's not a good idea to bet against the Chinese people. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1209.46s)]

*  Yes, they are in some areas. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1238.42s)]
*  Our Chinese competitors are breathing down our neck [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1239.94s)]

*  In the future. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1367.22s)]

*  population. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1374.98s)]
*  Maybe we can, for example, remote control such kind of robots to help my grandpa, for example. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1376.3400000000001s)]
*  President Xi, who visited this company last year, has called for the mass production of [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1386.5800000000002s)]

*  In his annual New Year's speech, he talked about the country's economic woes and for the first time [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1396.98s)]
*  acknowledged the high unemployment rate. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1403.78s)]
*  Still, he has laid out a long-term goal of doubling China's economy by 2035 [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1406.98s)]
*  and surpassing the West in technology. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1413.3000000000002s)]
*  Our companies and tech experts are competing on AI and biotech and quantum mathematics. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1416.58s)]
*  All those technological advances will lead to a new generation of military technology. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1423.46s)]
*  Our two militaries are vying for military supremacy. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1429.9399999999998s)]

*  which is the Indo-Pacific? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1436.98s)]
*  Presidents Biden and Xi met in San Francisco in November [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1439.3799999999999s)]
*  in hopes of reestablishing military communications between our two countries, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1443.94s)]
*  which China had cut off. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1449.3s)]
*  I think we're back to a more settled and stable relationship between the two countries, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1451.38s)]
*  but it's been a roller coaster. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1456.18s)]
*  The low point, he says, was the spy balloon incident last year. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1458.02s)]
*  But there's also been the buildup of military bases in the South China Sea, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1463.06s)]
*  the increase of air sorties near Taiwan, and the buzzing of U.S. military planes. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1468.18s)]
*  Do you see a lowering of the temperature in the South China Sea? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1475.14s)]
*  No, and that's a problem. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1479.78s)]
*  You don't. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1481.7s)]
*  And then in Taiwan, following Speaker Pelosi's visit, we've seen now for 16 months a much higher [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1482.42s)]
*  rate of Chinese both air activity and naval activity that's very intimidating, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1488.1000000000001s)]

*  The Taiwan authorities. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1495.8600000000001s)]

*  And I think ultimately they want to become and overtake the United States [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1499.22s)]
*  as the dominant country globally, and we don't want that to happen. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1503.5400000000002s)]
*  We don't want to live in a world where the Chinese are the dominant country. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1507.6200000000001s)]
*  When the Cold War ended, we all thought our system had won. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1511.6200000000001s)]
*  Their system failed. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1518.3400000000001s)]
*  Our system rose up. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1519.5400000000002s)]
*  Now he's come back and said, no, no, the communist system's the right way. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1522.3400000000001s)]
*  I guess we didn't bury that after all. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1527.7s)]
*  You know, it's interesting to compare the old Cold War with this time. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1530.98s)]
*  What distinguishes this time versus the old Cold War? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1535.5400000000002s)]
*  Soviet Union had a strong military and nuclear weapons. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1539.7s)]
*  It had a very weak economy, which in no way competed with ours. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1542.8200000000002s)]
*  China's economy is very strong. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1548.58s)]
*  We're dealing with an adversary, a competitor in China, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1551.78s)]
*  stronger than the Soviet Union was in the 1940s, 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1555.6999999999998s)]
*  So if that was a Cold War, what are you calling this? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1561.9399999999998s)]
*  It's a competition of ideas, a battle of ideas. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1565.54s)]
*  Our idea, America's big idea of a democratic society and human freedom [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1570.82s)]
*  versus China's idea that a communist state is stronger than a democracy. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1576.6599999999999s)]
*  We don't believe that. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1581.3s)]
*  So there's a battle here as to whose ideas should lead the world. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1583.2199999999998s)]
*  And we believe those are American ideas. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1588.58s)]
*  The United States Navy helped secure victory in two world wars and the Cold War. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1600.02s)]
*  Today, the Navy remains a formidable fighting force, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1605.62s)]

*  It's a decision of the president of the United States and a decision of the Congress. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1769.7s)]
*  It's our duty to be ready for that. But the bulk of the United States Navy will be deployed [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1773.86s)]

*  We're ready, yes. I'll never admit to being ready enough. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1793.06s)]
*  President Biden has declared four times, including on 60 Minutes, that the U.S. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1799.78s)]

*  To reach the USS Nimitz, we first traveled to America's westernmost territory, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1813.6200000000001s)]
*  the island of Guam, in the middle of the Pacific. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1819.06s)]

*  U.S. Marines recaptured it two and a half years later. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1829.78s)]
*  And the island, about the size of Chicago, became an indispensable strategic foothold [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1833.1399999999999s)]
*  in the Western Pacific as it remains today. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1838.34s)]
*  From Guam, we boarded a Navy C-2 Greyhound. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1842.26s)]
*  The Cold War-era transport plane takes people and supplies back and forth from land to the carrier. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1845.3799999999999s)]
*  It was a short flight to the ship and an even shorter landing. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1852.82s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1862.5s)]
*  First cod landing? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1863.1399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1864.34s)]
*  Oh, very nice. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1864.84s)]
*  Certain operations... [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1866.1s)]
*  Before Admiral Paparo rose to lead the Pacific fleet, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1866.9799999999998s)]
*  he flew jets and graduated from the school known as Top Gun. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1870.5s)]
*  When you talk about ships, what's the most powerful in the U.S. Navy? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1874.9799999999998s)]
*  It's an aircraft carrier, and its air wing is capable of 150 strike or air-to-air sorties [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1878.58s)]
*  per day, with at its surge levels the ability to deliver 900 precision guided munitions [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1885.9399999999998s)]
*  every day and reloadable every night. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1893.54s)]
*  So even though China now has the largest Navy in the world, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1897.3s)]
*  they don't have anything like this in terms of aircraft carriers. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1900.82s)]
*  They do not, but they're working towards it. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1903.46s)]
*  And they have two operational aircraft carriers right now. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1906.26s)]
*  That's China's two diesel-fueled carriers, to the U.S.'s 11 nuclear-powered ones that can carry a [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1909.6200000000001s)]
*  total of about 1,000 attack aircraft, more than the Navy's of every other nation on Earth combine. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1916.9s)]
*  I'll tell you this. We are here to stay, right, in the South China Sea and in this part of the world. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1924.1000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the message that we really want to convey to not only China, but the entire [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1928.98s)]
*  world. We will sail wherever international law allows. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1933.94s)]
*  Lieutenant Commander David Ash flies an F-18. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1938.26s)]
*  Do you get briefed on China's growing military threat and the progress that their Navy is making? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1943.78s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely we do. And they are making great progress in a lot of key areas. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1952.26s)]
*  The Chinese? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1957.6200000000001s)]
*  The Chinese are, from a military standpoint. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1958.26s)]
*  This video from Weapons Systems Officer Lieutenant Commander Matthew Carlton [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1961.22s)]
*  shows his F-18 strafing ground targets with a machine gun on a U.S. weapons range near Guam. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1966.02s)]
*  The pilots on the Nimitz also conduct air-to-air combat or dogfighting drills daily. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1976.26s)]
*  How aggressive has China become in the air? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1983.86s)]
*  Aggressive. And just some examples include unsafe, unprofessional intercepts where they [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1987.3000000000002s)]
*  move within single digits of feet of other aircraft, flashing the weapons that they have [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1993.38s)]
*  on board to the other aircraft, operating in international airspace, maneuvering their aircraft [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=1998.42s)]
*  in such a way that denies the ability to turn in one direction. If they're safe and professional, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2004.5s)]
*  then there's no problem. Everybody has the right to fly and sail wherever international law dictates. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2011.86s)]
*  But the Chinese are pushing that. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2020.1799999999998s)]
*  They are pushing it. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2021.78s)]
*  China's increasingly aggressive moves in the Western Pacific, encroaching on territory, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2023.3799999999999s)]
*  illegal fishing, and building bases in the middle of the South China Sea have pushed nations like [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2028.9799999999998s)]
*  Japan and the Philippines to forge closer military ties to the U.S. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2035.22s)]
*  And this past week, Britain, the U.S., and Australia signed a landmark deal to jointly [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2040.8999999999999s)]
*  develop nuclear-powered attack submarines to patrol the Pacific. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2047.1399999999999s)]
*  This is how China and Taiwan appear on most maps. This is how the Chinese Communist Party [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2052.66s)]
*  sees the Western Pacific, including the South and East China Seas from Beijing. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2059.38s)]
*  Taiwan is the fulcrum in what China's leaders call the first island chain, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2065.06s)]
*  a constellation of U.S. allies that stretches across its entire coast. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2070.26s)]
*  Control of Taiwan is the strategic key to unlocking direct access to the Pacific [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2076.1800000000003s)]
*  and the sea lanes where about 50 percent of the world's commerce gets transported. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2082.34s)]
*  China has accused the United States of trying to contain them. What do you say to China? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2087.7s)]
*  I would say, do you need to be contained? Are you expanding? Are you an expansionist power? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2094.8199999999997s)]
*  To a very great extent, the United States was the champion for China's rise. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2102.18s)]
*  And in no way are we seeking to contain China. What we are seeking for them to play by the rules [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2108.66s)]
*  China's navy, a branch of the People's Liberation Army, is now the world's largest. China is also [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2117.8599999999997s)]
*  using its 9,000-mile coastline to rewrite the rules of fighting at sea, as these images from [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2124.74s)]
*  Chinese state media show. Its military has invested heavily in long-range precision-guided weapons [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2131.7s)]
*  like the DF-21 and DF-26 that can be used to target ships. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2139.2999999999997s)]
*  China's People's Liberation Army Rocket Force calls them [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2144.42s)]
*  carrier killers and has practiced shooting them at mockups of American ships in the desert [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2151.14s)]
*  that look a lot like the Nimitz. Since the United States has been operating in the Western Pacific, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2156.34s)]
*  China's backyard, they've been developing missiles to attack our assets. Haven't they? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2162.9s)]
*  Absolutely, yes. First, I'll say the United States is also a Western Pacific nation. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2169.38s)]
*  So it's not China's backyard. It's, you know, it is a free and open Indo-Pacific that encompasses [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2176.1800000000003s)]
*  numerous partners and treaty allies. And yes, we have seen them greatly enhance their power [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2184.7400000000002s)]
*  projection capability. How much do you worry about the PLA rocket force? I worry, you know, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2191.62s)]
*  I'd be a fool to not worry about it. Of course I worry about the PLA rocket force. Of course I [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2196.42s)]
*  work every single day to develop the tactics and the techniques and the procedures to counter it [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2201.14s)]
*  and to continue to develop the systems that can also defend against them. About how far are we [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2206.98s)]
*  from mainland China? 1,500 nautical miles. They can hit us? Yes, they can. If they've got the [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2213.06s)]
*  targeting in place, they could hit this aircraft carrier. If I don't want to be hit, there's [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2218.66s)]
*  something I can do about it. U.S. Navy planners aren't just plotting how to evade China's rocket [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2225.62s)]
*  force, but also how they could effectively fight back. From the vicinity of Guam, none of the [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2230.8199999999997s)]
*  aircraft on this ship has the range to approach Taiwan without refueling in the air. Ships like [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2237.94s)]
*  the U.S. destroyer Wayne E. Meyer, part of the Nimitz strike group, would need to sail much closer [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2246.1s)]
*  towards China to fire their missiles at any force invading Taiwan. One naval scholar we spoke to [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2252.02s)]
*  likened it to a boxing match in which a fighter, in this case China, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2260.18s)]
*  has much longer arms than their potential opponent, the U.S. I'll give you a lot of [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2265.94s)]
*  examples where a shorter fighter was able to prevail over a long arm fighter by being on their [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2271.62s)]
*  toes, by maneuvering. And we can also stick and move while we're developing those longer range [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2278.18s)]
*  weapons. There is another area of modern naval warfare where the U.S. had a head start and [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2287.06s)]
*  retains a deep advantage over China. I just noticed out of the corner of my eye. This is a 688 class, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2292.8999999999996s)]
*  a Los Angeles class attack submarine. This is the most capable submarine on the planets, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2299.54s)]
*  with the exception of the Virginia class, our newer class of submarines. The exact number is [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2305.22s)]
*  classified, but our best estimate is that there are about a dozen nuclear-powered fast attack [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2311.14s)]
*  submarines patrolling the Pacific at any time. They are difficult to detect and track, something [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2316.42s)]
*  China is trying to solve. How much more advanced is U.S. submarine technology than Chinese capability? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2322.66s)]
*  A generation. A generation. And by a generation, I think 10 or 20 years, but broadly, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2331.62s)]
*  I don't really talk in depth about submarine capabilities. It's the silent service. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2337.94s)]
*  Since Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, China's military leaders have themselves been mostly [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2342.66s)]
*  silent and ignored efforts by the U.S. military to keep the lines of communication open, even when [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2348.58s)]
*  a Chinese spy balloon breached American airspace and was shot down by the U.S. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2355.22s)]
*  If the U.S. and Chinese militaries can't communicate over a Chinese spy balloon, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2360.8199999999997s)]
*  then what's going to happen when there's a real crisis in the South China Sea or with Taiwan? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2367.22s)]
*  We'll hope that they'll answer the phone. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2372.5s)]
*  Else, we'll do our very best assessment based on the things that they say in open source [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2377.06s)]
*  and based on their behavior to divine their intentions and we'll act accordingly. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2383.2999999999997s)]
*  Doesn't that make the situation even more dangerous if U.S. and Chinese militaries are not talking? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2389.14s)]
*  Yes. Several sources within the Pentagon tell 60 Minutes that if China invaded Taiwan, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2396.5s)]
*  it could very well kick off in outer space, with both sides targeting the other satellites that [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2403.62s)]
*  enable precision-guided weaponry. Cyber attacks on American cities and the sabotage of ports on the [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2409.62s)]
*  west coast of the U.S. mainland could follow. One recent non-classified war game had the U.S. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2416.66s)]
*  prevailing but losing 20 ships, including two carriers. Does that sound about right? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2423.46s)]
*  That is a plausible outcome. I can imagine a more pessimistic outcome and I can imagine [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2428.98s)]
*  a more optimistic outcome. We should be clear-eyed about the costs that we're potentially incurring. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2436.1s)]
*  There are about 5,000 Americans on board the Nimitz. The ship is nearly half a century old. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2444.02s)]
*  Given the Navy's current needs in the Pacific and because there's fuel left in its nuclear reactors, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2451.22s)]
*  the carrier's life at sea is going to be extended. Is it your hope that the power of the U.S. Navy, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2457.7799999999997s)]
*  the forced posture of the U.S. Navy, will deter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan? It's not my hope, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2465.46s)]
*  it's my duty in conjunction with allies and partners to deliver intolerable costs to anybody [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2472.18s)]
*  that would upend the order in violation of the nation's security or in violation of the nation's [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2479.2200000000003s)]
*  interests. The saying which is, see pacem parablem, which is if you want peace, prepare for war. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2484.82s)]
*  As China's President Xi prepares for a state visit in Russia tomorrow to strengthen that alliance, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2492.98s)]
*  we look at critical questions about the state of the U.S. Navy and its readiness when we come back. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2499.54s)]
*  60 minutes has spent months talking to current and former naval officers, military strategists, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2505.54s)]
*  and politicians about the state of the U.S. Navy. One common thread in our reporting is unease, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2526.02s)]
*  both about the size of the U.S. fleet and its readiness to fight. The Navy's ships are being [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2532.74s)]
*  retired faster than they're getting replaced, while the Navy of the People's Republic of China, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2538.66s)]
*  or PRC, grows larger and more lethal by the year. We asked the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2543.9399999999996s)]
*  Admiral Samuel Paparo, about this on our visit to the USS Nimitz, the oldest aircraft carrier in the [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2552.02s)]
*  Navy. We call it the decade of concern. We've seen a tenfold increase in the size of the PRC [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2558.58s)]
*  Navy. Technically speaking, the Chinese now have the largest Navy in the world in terms of number [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2569.06s)]
*  of ships, correct? Yes. Do the numbers matter? Yes. As the saying goes, quantity has a quality [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2576.02s)]
*  all its own. At some point, are they going to reach numbers that we can't prevail over? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2581.06s)]
*  I'm not comfortable with the trajectory. If you look at a map at the Indo-Pacific, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2588.42s)]
*  one thing becomes clear. There's a lot of water on that map. And so ours has to be a maritime [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2592.7400000000002s)]
*  strategy. Republican Mike Gallagher and Democrat Elaine Luria served together on the House Armed [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2599.2200000000003s)]
*  Services Committee in the last Congress. What is it about the U.S. Navy that has allowed the two of [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2605.2200000000003s)]
*  you to find common cause? I think we share a sense of the urgency of the moment. We see increasing [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2610.9s)]
*  threats from China in particular in the Indo-Pacific. We feel like we're not moving [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2616.18s)]
*  fast enough to build a bigger Navy. Congressman Gallagher is a Marine veteran who represents [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2620.8999999999996s)]

*  the Navy's current plan, the fleet will shrink to 280 ships by 2027, the same year the CIA says [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2632.8199999999997s)]
*  China has set for having the capability to take Taiwan by force. So we will be weakest when our [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2641.3s)]
*  enemy is potentially strongest. China's increased rhetoric and potential aggression against Taiwan. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2647.3s)]
*  We're going to have to be ready to respond today with the forces we have today. Former congresswoman [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2653.2200000000003s)]
*  Elaine Luria represented Virginia Beach until this past January. An Annapolis graduate, Luria had a [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2658.5800000000004s)]
*  20-year naval career before being elected to Congress. What would you say the state of the [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2665.7000000000003s)]
*  U.S. Navy is today? I think the Navy has not received the attention and resources that it [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2670.58s)]
*  needs over two decades. I mean, I served on six different ships. Every single one of those ships [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2676.02s)]
*  was either built during or a product of the fleet that was built in the Cold War. Both Mike Gallagher [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2680.02s)]
*  and Elaine Luria have lobbied for government money for the shipyards in or near their districts, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2687.7799999999997s)]
*  but they say this is less about jobs and more about national security. If we don't get this [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2693.22s)]
*  right, all of these other things we're doing in Congress, ultimately that might not matter. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2698.58s)]
*  If you think about what a coherent grand strategy vis-a-vis China would be, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2702.18s)]
*  hard power would be the most important part of that and the Navy would be the most [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2705.22s)]
*  important component of your hard power investments. Over the last two decades, the Navy spent 55 [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2708.66s)]
*  billion dollars on two investments that did not pan out. The first was a class of destroyers known [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2715.7799999999997s)]
*  as the Zumwalt. The futuristic fighting ships were supposed to revolutionize naval warfare. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2722.82s)]
*  32 were ordered, but only three were ever launched. The cost of each ship by one estimate [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2729.86s)]
*  was upwards of eight billion dollars, making them the three most expensive destroyers ever put to [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2736.42s)]
*  sea. Another example is the Littoral Combat Ship or LCS, designed to be a fast all-purpose warship [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2744.02s)]
*  for shallow waters. Thirty billion dollars later, the program ran aground after structural defects [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2752.5s)]
*  and engine trouble. Within the Navy, the LCS earned the unfortunate nickname, Little Crappy Ship. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2760.66s)]
*  The Navy's last few decades have been described as a lost generation of shipbuilding. Is that overly [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2768.5s)]
*  dramatic? I don't think so. We're still struggling to build ships on time, on budget, and that's [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2774.1s)]
*  something we absolutely need to fix going forward. This past week, we spoke with Admiral Mike Gilday [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2780.66s)]
*  at the Pentagon. He is the chief of naval operations and is responsible for building, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2786.1s)]
*  maintaining, and equipping the entire U.S. Navy. Is the Navy in crisis? No, the Navy's not in crisis. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2791.46s)]
*  The Navy is out on point every single day. Is it being outpaced by China? No, our Navy's still in a [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2799.22s)]
*  position to prevail, but that's not blind confidence. We are concerned with the trajectory [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2807.3s)]
*  that China's on, with China's behavior, but we are in a good position right now if we did ever get [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2813.38s)]
*  into a fight against them. How would you describe what China has been able to do militarily over the [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2819.38s)]
*  last 20 years? The most alarming thing is the growth of not only their conventional forces, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2825.6200000000003s)]
*  but also their strategic nuclear forces, their cyber capability, their space capability, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2830.6600000000003s)]
*  and how they're using that to force other nations, navies, out of certain areas in the South China Sea. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2836.34s)]
*  Instead of recognizing international law, they want to control where those goods flow and how. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2843.86s)]
*  What lessons did the U.S. Navy learn from some of the shipbuilding mistakes of the last 20 years? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2850.1800000000003s)]
*  I think one of the things that we learned was that we need to have a design well in place [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2856.1000000000004s)]
*  before we begin bending metal. And so we were going back to the past, to what we did in the 80s and the 90s. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2862.74s)]
*  The Navy has the lead. There is a tendency among the great powers to look at each other's naval [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2869.8599999999997s)]
*  buildups with deep suspicion. Toshi Yoshihara of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2876.3399999999997s)]
*  may know more than any scholar in the West about China's Navy. China will have about 440 ships [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2883.4599999999996s)]
*  by 2030, and that's according to the Pentagon. Why is China able to build more warships more quickly [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2890.82s)]
*  than the U.S.? China has clearly invested in this defense industrial infrastructure to produce these [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2898.42s)]
*  ships, which allows them to produce multiple ships simultaneously, essentially outbuilding [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2904.1000000000004s)]
*  many of the Western navies combined. China's Navy piggybacks on a booming commercial shipbuilding [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2910.34s)]
*  industry kept afloat by generous state subsidies, inexpensive materials, and cheap labor. In the [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2916.5s)]
*  United States, it's a different story. After the Cold War ended, the shipbuilding industry consolidated, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2923.86s)]
*  and many of the yards where ships were both built and maintained closed down. What do you see when [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2931.06s)]
*  you see China's shipbuilding program? It's very robust. Do we have enough shipyards? No. I wish [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2937.06s)]
*  that we had more commercial shipyards. Over my career, we've gone from more than 30 shipyards [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2942.66s)]
*  down to about seven that we rely upon on a day-to-day basis to build ships. One of those [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2947.54s)]
*  yards is run by Huntington Ingalls Industries, which built the state-of-the-art new Ford-class [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2952.66s)]
*  aircraft carrier. After controlled explosions in 2021 to prove it could withstand combat, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2959.22s)]
*  the Ford got closer to deployment, six years late and billions of dollars over budget. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2970.1s)]
*  The Navy's not just struggling to build new ships on time. According to the Government Accountability [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2977.06s)]
*  Office, or GAO, there's a multi-year backlog repairing the ships in the fleet. Our maintenance [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2982.3399999999997s)]
*  backlog is one of the primary things that I'm working on to correct. So just three years ago, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2989.22s)]
*  we had 7,700 delay days, that is extra days in a shipyard by ships when they weren't operational. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=2996.26s)]
*  We have cut that down to 3,000. We are not satisfied. Maintenance delays mean sailors [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3004.1800000000003s)]
*  can't come home because the ship that's supposed to replace them is not ready. It means longer [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3011.1400000000003s)]
*  deployments. It means away from your family more. That's a big strain on the workforce. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3016.26s)]
*  The more ships that we can have available to send at sea alleviates many of those problems that you [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3021.38s)]
*  pointed out. Sailors join the Navy to see the world, and so it's my job to make sure that those [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3026.98s)]
*  maintenance delays go to zero and we can get those ships to sea as quickly as possible. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3033.54s)]
*  In the last year alone, at least 10 sailors assigned to ships undergoing maintenance or [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3038.98s)]
*  working at maintenance facilities have died by suicide. It is a problem that we're taking very, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3044.1800000000003s)]
*  seriously and down to every leader in our Navy. Everybody has a responsibility to look out for [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3051.8599999999997s)]
*  each other, to take care of each other. There is no wrong door to knock on when you need help. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3057.7799999999997s)]
*  Admiral Gilday says the U.S. Navy's main advantage over China is America's sailors. His goal is to [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3062.98s)]
*  modernize the U.S. fleet and have those sailors serving alongside hundreds of unmanned vessels [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3069.7799999999997s)]
*  by 2045. I think unmanned is the future, and so I think that some 40 percent of our fleet in the [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3076.2599999999998s)]
*  future, I believe, is going to be unmanned. Are these like underwater drones? Some of them are [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3083.3799999999997s)]
*  highly capable, capable of delivering mines and perhaps other types of weapons. Admiral Gilday [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3088.58s)]
*  is talking about the Orca, an extra-large unmanned undersea vehicle. Can you say what it will do or [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3094.18s)]
*  is that classified? Well, at a minimum, it'll have a clandestine mine laying capability, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3100.98s)]
*  so it'll be done in a way that is very secretive but very effective. But the GAO reports that it's [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3106.1s)]
*  already a quarter of a billion dollars over budget and three years behind schedule. That particular [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3114.02s)]
*  platform is behind schedule. It's the first of a kind when it delivers ICA very high return on [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3120.82s)]
*  investment from that particular platform. Because? Because it will be among the most lethal [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3127.62s)]
*  and stealthy platforms in the arsenal of the U.S. military. The Navy's total budget request for fiscal [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3134.58s)]

*  The focus is on China. The U.S. defense posture is viewed as aggressive by the Chinese. The [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3151.06s)]
*  foreign minister just said, look, stop the containment. This may lead to conflict. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3158.1800000000003s)]
*  Perhaps the Chinese minister doesn't like the fact that the U.S. Navy is operating in collaboration [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3163.06s)]
*  with dozens of navies around the world to ensure that the Maritime Commons remains free and open [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3170.26s)]
*  for all nations. The Chinese want to dictate those terms. And so they don't like our presence. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3176.82s)]
*  But our presence is not intended to be provocative. It's intended to assure and to reassure allies [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3183.3s)]
*  and partners around the world that those sea lanes do remain open. The global economy literally floats [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3190.42s)]

*  Ever since Mao Zedong won China's civil war in 1949 and the losing anti-communist side fled to a [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3206.82s)]
*  small nearby island, Beijing has insisted that that island, Taiwan, is an integral part of the [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3228.98s)]
*  mainland. The U.S. has walked a tightrope, respecting that one China policy, but maintaining a [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3236.18s)]
*  special relationship with Taiwan, today a progressive, thriving democracy. In September, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3243.94s)]
*  President Biden vowed on this broadcast that the U.S. will protect Taiwan. This past week, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3251.46s)]
*  the Taiwanese government said China aims to normalize its military pressure on the island, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3258.5s)]
*  that escalated after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited in August with its largest military drill [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3264.74s)]
*  ever. In a display of frightening military might, China subjected Taiwan to three days [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3272.66s)]
*  of continuous sorties with over a hundred warplanes, a barrage of ballistic missiles, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3282.3399999999997s)]
*  and warships that encircle the island, delivering a loud and clear message [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3290.02s)]
*  that China could choke Taiwan anytime it wanted to. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3296.02s)]
*  Admiral Li Shimin, who used to head Taiwan's armed forces, has been ringing alarm bells for years [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3309.94s)]
*  because as China's military has been growing, Taiwan's is shrinking. The number of soldiers [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3317.06s)]
*  in uniform has been cut in half over the years. The length of mandatory service has been reduced [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3324.98s)]
*  to just four months. And Admiral Li complains that the government has been buying the wrong [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3331.54s)]
*  weapons for years, tanks and jets from the United States, instead of smaller portable missiles. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3337.54s)]
*  What I gather you think the military needs are these stingers and javelins and drones, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3345.06s)]
*  exactly what they need in Ukraine. Yeah, it's the truth. And you're not getting them now, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3352.42s)]
*  because they're giving them to Ukraine. We already ordered it, in my view, not enough. However, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3358.5s)]
*  we began to order that, but we have not yet received any. Because other countries also have [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3364.9s)]
*  kind of similar requirements. We are not on the top list, but we need now. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3371.7000000000003s)]
*  Did the Taiwanese military waste all those years buying those big weapons? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3378.82s)]
*  I believe so, you know, but we don't have time to waste anymore. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3386.1s)]
*  Taiwan doesn't get U.S. military aid. It buys the weapons, but the manufacturers can't keep [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3392.34s)]
*  up with the demand. The Taiwanese have already purchased about $14 billion worth of weapons that [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3399.38s)]
*  they have yet to receive. We were surprised that few here seem to share the admiral's sense of [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3406.42s)]
*  urgency. Here in Taiwan, you'd never know that the Dragon to the North recently sent warships [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3413.38s)]
*  to surround the island. People told us over and over, no big deal. China's been doing versions of [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3420.26s)]
*  that for 70 years. While much of the world thought an invasion was imminent, polls show that a [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3427.3s)]
*  majority of Taiwanese think that's unlikely anytime soon, if ever. And that's reflected in what we saw [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3433.78s)]
*  in the capital, Taipei, where life goes on uninterrupted. Morning traffic flows normally. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3442.1800000000003s)]
*  Shoppers do what they always do during the day and at night. We saw old people painting outdoors [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3449.86s)]
*  and teenagers practicing hip-hop routines, despite the threat from the North. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3458.98s)]
*  This kind of threat is our daily life. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3466.7400000000002s)]
*  Wang Dingyu, a parliamentarian from southern Taiwan, says a kind of war has already started. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3469.6200000000003s)]
*  China, they tried to annex Taiwan for past 50 years. They tried all different kinds of way. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3476.42s)]
*  Maybe I can give you very concrete figures. There are 20 million cyber attacks per day. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3484.42s)]
*  Per day? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3492.82s)]
*  Yes, every day. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3493.54s)]
*  Wang, who sits on Parliament's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3495.3s)]
*  took us to a high-security lab where engineers track those attacks. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3499.78s)]
*  This is Taiwan. A small island, but we're proud of it. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3504.98s)]
*  The map shows the attacks from China in real time as they hit Taiwan. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3509.86s)]
*  And it's so close to China. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3515.78s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3517.62s)]
*  So is China hoping to defeat Taiwan without firing a single shot? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3519.38s)]
*  They dream like that. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3525.38s)]
*  They dream. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3526.66s)]
*  They desperately dream like that. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3527.78s)]
*  He says, on top of cyber warfare, they're trying to sabotage Taiwan's thriving economy [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3529.7s)]
*  and intimidate politically powerful groups like the farmers and fishermen in Wang's home district [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3536.98s)]
*  of Tainan, who've been hit especially hard with a series of export bans. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3543.7s)]
*  When Speaker Pelosi was here, China, we're told, banned 1,000 products, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3549.3799999999997s)]
*  Taiwanese products, a lot from your region down here. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3556.66s)]
*  Like the fish industry. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3564.58s)]
*  90 percent of grouper exports went to China last year. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3567.94s)]
*  But suddenly in June, Beijing banned Taiwan's grouper, devastating the fishermen. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3572.82s)]
*  Boxes and boxes of fish piled up. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3579.7s)]
*  China also went after pineapples, crushing farmers like this young couple. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3583.3s)]
*  It devastated us. Our pineapples got stuck in Taiwan and we lost 60,000 U.S. dollars. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3590.42s)]
*  And I understand the ban was sudden like that. No warning. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3596.42s)]
*  The government fought back with a freedom pineapple campaign to entice everyone to buy [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3602.02s)]
*  and eat a lot of pineapples. Oh, my God. They're so sweet. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3608.58s)]
*  Our housewives, they have a voice, say, let's eat pineapple on our dining table. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3613.2999999999997s)]
*  Everybody's eating pineapple. Military, they lunch, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3618.9s)]
*  they dinner, provide pineapples. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3622.8199999999997s)]
*  We found a fairly prosperous country, a leading exporter of bicycles and other sports gear. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3625.38s)]
*  This tiny island is a tech giant in agriculture innovation and above all, in semiconductors. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3632.98s)]
*  Taiwan is practically the world's only source of the thinnest microchips, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3641.2999999999997s)]
*  manufactured almost exclusively by one company, TSMC. China relies on these, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3646.74s)]
*  as does the rest of the world, for things like iPhones, advanced computers and car components. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3654.02s)]
*  Ninety-one-year-old Morris Chang, TSMC's founder, explains why a lot of people here [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3661.2999999999997s)]
*  think the chips protect them from Xi Jinping's attacking. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3667.8599999999997s)]
*  I've heard this expression, silicon shield or chip shield, talking about your company. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3672.18s)]
*  Well, it means that perhaps because our company provides a lot of chips to the world, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3681.3799999999997s)]
*  maybe somebody will refrain from attacking it. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3690.42s)]
*  If that person's priority is for economic well-being, I think they will refrain from attacking. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3696.1s)]
*  What if the priority is to come here and nationalize your company within, you know, one China? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3705.06s)]
*  If there's a war, it will be destroyed. Everything will be destroyed. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3713.14s)]
*  China say, some of their Chinese communists say, let's invade Taiwan and occupy TSMC, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3717.54s)]
*  make it become party-owned company. Then we will be superpower. United States and Japan and Europe, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3725.7s)]
*  we don't supply them chip. They will follow Chinese orders. But that's naive. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3732.66s)]
*  Why is that naive? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3739.38s)]
*  Not only a chip company, even a sausage company, you need recipe, you need human capitals, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3741.2200000000003s)]
*  you need to know how to manufacture that kind of products. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3749.38s)]
*  If there is reunification, what would happen to you? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3754.66s)]
*  Die. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3758.82s)]
*  Die? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3759.86s)]
*  Yeah. If they annex Taiwan, people like me, a lot, will be perished. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3760.5s)]
*  Beijing has sanctioned Wang Dingyu personally for being outspokenly pro-Taiwan's independence. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3768.5s)]
*  He passionately defends the country's progressive democracy. We saw campaign billboards everywhere, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3776.5s)]
*  validating the island's commitment to clean elections and freedom of speech. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3783.7s)]
*  Beijing has promised that if there were reunification, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3789.38s)]
*  Taiwan could maintain many of its freedoms. And yet... [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3793.54s)]
*  In 2019, China broke a similar promise to Hong Kong. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3799.14s)]
*  Protests led to beatings, arrests and stripping of democratic rights. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3806.1s)]
*  It hit home in Taiwan and led to President Tsai Ing-wen, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3811.54s)]
*  leader of the aggressively anti-reunification party, winning reelection in a landslide. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3816.58s)]
*  We are firmly resolved to defend our freedom, democracy and way of life. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3823.46s)]
*  Given what happened in Hong Kong and the recent military escalation, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3830.1s)]
*  we were curious why the people are so stoic. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3835.06s)]
*  Asked if they're in denial or apathetic, a Taiwanese writer said it's kind of like global warming. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3838.7400000000002s)]
*  You know it's there and it's going to get worse. But mostly people go about their lives. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3845.62s)]
*  What can one individual really do? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3851.46s)]
*  But then the Taiwanese watched the Ukrainians stand up to the Russians. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3854.7400000000002s)]
*  It so inspired Jack Yao, a young Taipei coffee vendor, that he went there to help the fight. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3861.3s)]
*  Did you go because you're Taiwanese? What's the connection? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3868.26s)]
*  Just like the Ukrainian situation and our situation, it's very light. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3872.58s)]
*  They also have big neighbors. They were the communists. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3877.7s)]
*  We have to face the Chinese communists. They want to take us. They always want to take us. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3882.66s)]
*  Was it in your mind that if you go to fight for Ukraine, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3888.2599999999998s)]
*  other people will come here and fight for Taiwan? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3894.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3897.22s)]
*  What the Ukrainians have done is raising a question here in Taiwan if that small democracy [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3898.18s)]
*  can stand up to its menacing neighbor, why can't we? You see civil defense classes sprouting up, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3905.78s)]
*  like this one on how to identify Chinese fake news during an attack and this night class in the park [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3912.9s)]
*  on how to operate two-way radios in Morse code in case the internet is knocked out. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3921.46s)]
*  We want our students to be able to apply a tourniquet within 30 seconds. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3927.78s)]
*  Enoch Wu, a former special forces soldier, is running training workshops on how to treat [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3932.42s)]
*  bullet and shrapnel wounds and conduct search and rescue. And Admiral Lee wants to take it a step [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3938.66s)]
*  further, calling on the government to arm Taiwan citizens and create a volunteer force like Ukraine's. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3946.02s)]
*  If Ukraine can do that, why not Taiwan? I'm trying to convince our people. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3953.94s)]
*  That is important because this is a symbol of the deterrence, determination. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3960.5s)]
*  So you're proposing what I guess I would call the Ukraine model. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3966.74s)]
*  Similar. Ukraine people really inspire all people, but do all people change fast enough? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3972.02s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3981.14s)]
*  Do you think that Taiwanese have that same kind of determination? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3982.5s)]
*  I strongly believe this because we cherish how we live. We love peace. We don't like war. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3988.66s)]
*  But we will see our democracy, our life for peace. Let's surrender. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=3996.42s)]
*  Is there a chance you'll surrender? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4004.02s)]
*  No, not a chance. Never. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4006.18s)]
*  Hong Kong is famous for its freewheeling capitalism. After 150 years as a British colony, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4018.58s)]
*  the city returned to Chinese control in 1997. China promised Hong Kong partial autonomy for [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4035.86s)]
*  50 years, with an independent legal system and freedom of speech guaranteed. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4043.62s)]
*  But many Hong Kongers believe the Chinese government is now chipping away at those [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4049.7s)]
*  limited freedoms. So they're demanding full democracy, the right to elect their own leaders [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4054.42s)]
*  without interference from Beijing. Who are the protesters and what are their chances of success? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4060.66s)]
*  To find out, we went to Hong Kong. But to understand what's going on there, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4067.38s)]
*  you have to start here. In Beijing on October 1st, they threw a carefully [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4072.98s)]
*  choreographed birthday party for the Chinese regime. It's been 70 years since the communists [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4080.7400000000002s)]
*  took power. The show of strength and stability by a rising superpower was also a warning to Hong Kong. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4088.7400000000002s)]
*  Hong Kong. Pandas in Beijing. Pandemonium in Hong Kong. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4096.34s)]
*  1200 miles south, people were in no mood to celebrate. Hong Kongers are demanding unfettered [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4105.22s)]
*  democracy for their city of seven million people. Many wear face masks to hide their identity from [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4113.22s)]
*  the police. On the 70th anniversary, the march started peacefully as they normally do. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4120.26s)]
*  At 71, Jimmy Lai has lived the Hong Kong dream. Born in mainland China, he fled the [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4130.18s)]
*  communists when he was 12 years old. He went from rags to riches. From a worker in a textile factory [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4137.38s)]
*  to a billionaire with a chain of fashion stores. And then this. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4145.78s)]
*  In 1989, when Chinese tanks massacred students in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4153.46s)]
*  he got involved in politics. Starting a media company in Hong Kong that isn't afraid to [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4160.0199999999995s)]
*  criticise the Chinese government. I like to participate in delivering [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4165.94s)]
*  information because I think information is freedom. He told us Hong Kongers are demanding [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4171.3s)]
*  real democracy and are fighting to hold on to their basic human rights. The intention [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4177.86s)]
*  of the Chinese government taking away our freedom is so obvious that we know if we don't fight, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4184.66s)]
*  we will lose everything. What do you mean lose everything? Well, when you lose the freedom, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4192.34s)]
*  you lose everything. What do you have? I mean, you have a wonderful city, prosperity. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4198.5s)]
*  That's what Chinese think. That they think that we just have a body, we don't have a soul. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4204.34s)]
*  You guys just make money, have a good life. Don't think about politics, don't think about freedom, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4208.82s)]
*  don't think about human rights, don't think about rule of law. Just eat, enjoy life. Why is that not [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4214.26s)]
*  enough? Because we are human beings, we have soul, we are not a dog. And not willing to accept [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4220.58s)]
*  increasing interference from Beijing. At the anniversary celebration, China's President Xi [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4227.22s)]
*  Jinping predicted a brighter future for Hong Kong. But many in this city don't trust him. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4234.820000000001s)]
*  This gentleman marched proudly with an American flag. This man is a refugee from mainland China. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4245.54s)]
*  He says he swam here in 1962 and he hates the Chinese Communist Party. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4252.5s)]
*  Many of the protesters carry umbrellas. That started five years ago in previous demonstrations [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4259.3s)]
*  when they used umbrellas to protect themselves against pepper spray. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4266.02s)]
*  Now the protesters even have their own anthem. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4273.38s)]
*  They've released this orchestral version. May freedom reign go the lyrics, Glory be to thee, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4276.74s)]
*  Hong Kong. We share the same value as you Americans. What we are fighting for is the first [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4283.9400000000005s)]
*  battle of the new Cold War. The Cold War between the US and China? And China. And you're saying [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4292.5s)]
*  your values here in Hong Kong line up with the West? Yes, because of our British past. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4300.82s)]
*  They did not give us democracy, but they gave us the rule of law, the free market, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4307.62s)]
*  the private property right, free press. And they have none of those in mainland China? No, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4314.74s)]
*  they have none of those. For Jimmy Lai, those values don't come cheap. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4321.46s)]
*  The Chinese government has pressured companies not to advertise in his paper, he told us, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4326.42s)]
*  costing him millions of dollars a year. That's why few business people here dare to criticize [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4331.78s)]
*  China's rulers. I take the responsibility to fight because this gives me a meaning to my life. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4338.1s)]
*  This young woman, barely in her 20s, calls herself Paris. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4347.3s)]
*  This young woman, barely in her 20s, calls herself Paris. She dresses this way when she [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4351.7s)]
*  protests to protect her identity. The people of Hong Kong have been subject to citywide terrorism. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4357.86s)]
*  For four months, she's been on the front lines. The risk I'm taking is pretty much 10 years in [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4363.94s)]
*  jail on rioting charges, you know, maybe even more. Why are you willing to risk your future [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4369.62s)]
*  for these protests? If Hong Kong doesn't have a future, then like, what is my future here? I [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4375.22s)]
*  can't see Hong Kong having a future, you know, if the movement fails. Are you and other protesters [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4380.98s)]
*  willing to risk death? No, I'm not willing to die, but you know, I accept that it's a possibility. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4386.66s)]
*  I think Hong Kong is at a point where things can't turn back, things can only escalate from here. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4392.74s)]
*  The protesters and the police blame each other for the escalation. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4399.94s)]
*  Police say the protesters keep attacking them. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4404.5s)]
*  Protesters say the police keep overreacting, beating them when they're already down. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4408.339999999999s)]
*  When this group set upon police with metal rods, an officer shot one in the chest at point blank range. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4415.78s)]
*  He survived, becoming one of more than a thousand protesters to be treated in hospitals. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4423.54s)]
*  2000 have been arrested. I think it's difficult when all we have are umbrellas and police have [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4429.860000000001s)]
*  many weapons at their disposal. You don't only have umbrellas. We saw protesters who were throwing [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4436.900000000001s)]
*  petrol bombs and we've seen... Molotov cocktails. I would say that the police have pushed us [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4443.3s)]
*  into doing this. We watched protesters empty a suitcase full of Molotov cocktails [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4448.9800000000005s)]
*  and set fire to a subway station. The Beijing government uses scenes like this [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4456.42s)]
*  to paint the protesters as rioters paid off by foreign agents. The protesters say they won't [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4462.82s)]
*  leave the streets until their demands are met, but the Hong Kong authorities don't want to give in. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4470.1s)]
*  This is a stalemate and it's only the Chinese government in Beijing that can break it. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4475.78s)]
*  China has quietly doubled the size of its Hong Kong garrison in recent weeks. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4480.74s)]
*  This video seems to be a thinly veiled threat about what Chinese troops might do. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4487.78s)]
*  Bernard Chan is a Hong Kong delegate to China's rubber stamp legislature. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4496.98s)]
*  You wrote that Beijing sees this as a national security threat. Why is what happens in Hong Kong [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4502.42s)]
*  a national security threat for China? Well, look at some of the slogans that are used by the [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4509.3s)]
*  protesters. They say the liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times and then we have [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4515.22s)]
*  protesters carrying flags of the United States, of the UK and so on. How is that a threat to [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4521.14s)]
*  a superpower like China? I don't think it'll be helpful in any country when you see [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4529.0599999999995s)]
*  sign of another country involving in your local politics. For 30 years, the West has condemned [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4534.74s)]
*  China for the way that it handled the Tiananmen massacre in 1989. How do you think the world will [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4541.94s)]
*  view Beijing's response to these protests in 30 years time? I certainly believe that they do not [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4548.66s)]
*  want to see another repeat what happened back in 1989. So I think that's why they still very much [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4554.98s)]
*  on Hong Kong police to handle our own problem. The spark for these protests was a proposed law [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4560.82s)]
*  that could have seen people arrested in Hong Kong sent to mainland China, where Hong Kongers don't [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4567.78s)]
*  think they'd get a fair trial. Last month, the Hong Kong government finally withdrew the bill. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4573.7s)]
*  By then though, the protesters demands had expanded to include full democracy. This protest is all [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4580.259999999999s)]
*  about politics. It's about values. It's about civic freedom. Professor Samson Yun is studying [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4587.06s)]
*  the protesters. His researchers have interviewed more than 13,000 of them. He told us most of them [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4594.02s)]
*  are young, middle class and highly educated. With no official leaders, they organise through online [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4600.660000000001s)]
*  forums. People come up with tactical ideas on how to escalate the protests, how to be innovative, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4608.5s)]
*  people actually put this into action. Can you give me an example of that? People come up with [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4616.82s)]
*  the idea of protesting at the airport. That idea got a lot of support. So it turned into a real action. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4622.0199999999995s)]
*  Jimmy Lai, the dissident media mogul, says his relatives in mainland China have been threatened [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4629.38s)]
*  with arrest unless he tempers his criticism. He refuses. I decided a long time ago I'm not going [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4635.7s)]
*  to intimidate by fear. I said, look, to hell with it. I'm not going to think about the consequences [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4643.54s)]
*  of what I do. I just do what's right. Lai says his home is under constant surveillance, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4649.22s)]
*  an apparent attempt to frighten away visitors. Hi, I'm Holly Williams from 60 Minutes. Hi, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4655.14s)]
*  may I ask who you are and who you represent? No comment. No comment. Hello ma'am, I'm Holly [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4661.3s)]
*  Williams from 60 Minutes. Are you here every day, ma'am, watching Mr Lai? No, I don't think she [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4666.74s)]
*  wants to talk to us either. Later at the protest, there she was again. Excuse me, ma'am, are you [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4675.38s)]
*  still here following Mr Lai? Still taking pictures of people around Jimmy Lai, still not talking to [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4682.179999999999s)]
*  us. This week, China pressured people outside of Hong Kong. Apple took down an app that could help [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4689.38s)]
*  protesters evade police. Google dropped a game about the Hong Kong protests. And an NBA team [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4697.54s)]
*  executive apologised after tweeting support for the demonstrators. But on the street, the government's [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4705.14s)]
*  intimidation tactics have backfired, according to professors Samson Yoon. More people are joining [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4714.74s)]
*  the fights because of repeated police brutalities. Even the peaceful protesters think that perhaps [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4721.46s)]
*  violence is necessary. Yes, I think definitely. It's not indiscriminate violence. It's more targeted [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4728.0199999999995s)]
*  at the police authorities or the government authorities. I think right now the government [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4734.34s)]
*  is still trying to repress the protest and not willing to negotiate with the protesters. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4738.58s)]
*  The young protesters are idealistic and perhaps naive. But Jimmy Lai says they're Hong Kong's last [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4744.74s)]
*  chance for freedom. When I saw the kids went into front and confront the police, I was very touched. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4752.34s)]
*  I admire them. Why does it touch you? Because they risk their life to protect this place we call home. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4763.0599999999995s)]
*  Lai told us his generation has failed them. In the 30 years, we haven't done anything, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4773.62s)]
*  the older generation, to secure the freedom, the way of life for our kids. And that's why [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4780.5s)]
*  now they have to stand up and fight for themselves. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMAVm_z5eI&t=4788.58s)]
