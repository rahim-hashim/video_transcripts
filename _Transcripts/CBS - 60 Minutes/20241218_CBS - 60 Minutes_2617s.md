*  On a rainy afternoon, we watched as Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the artistic director of Hermès, turned [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=65.16s)]
*  his discerning eye to dozens of potential scarf designs. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=71.2s)]
*  Hermès scarves are screened and stitched by hand. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=75.08s)]
*  The only part of the process that happens quickly is this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=78.8s)]
*  Dumas chose the colors for next season scarves in less than an hour. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=82.67999999999999s)]

*  We'll be back with more stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=107.28s)]
*  Tonight, the Middle East is reeling from the astonishing fall of Bashar al-Assad, former [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=117.28s)]
*  president of Syria. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  Scott Pelley is in the Syrian capital, Damascus. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  An entire generation of Syrians has never known freedom. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=131.08s)]
*  And so when it swept over them last Sunday, there was shock, then joy, and a desperate [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=136.32s)]
*  hope that it might last. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=142.42s)]
*  Damascus is a city nearly 5,000 years old. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=145.16s)]
*  But over this decade, the war has seemed like the end of civilization. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=149.64s)]
*  Half a million Syrians are dead. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=156.24s)]
*  13 million have been forced from their homes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  This past week, we traveled 300 miles on the road to Damascus to meet a people awakening [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=162.68s)]
*  from 50 years of dictatorship. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  Take the road to Damascus from the east, and you find the suburb of Ain Tarmah. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  The outskirts of one of the great cities of history has been bombed into the Stone Age. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=182.24s)]
*  This was President Bashar al-Assad's answer to mostly unarmed protests that began in 2011. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=189.28s)]
*  Many who rose against Assad then are still here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=197.84s)]
*  That's the Zaydan family. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=203.08s)]
*  We were living here in peace. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  When we just demanded freedom and to be able to earn our daily bread, the Assad regime [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=209.64s)]
*  started bombing us. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=215.72s)]
*  Mohammed Saeed Zaydan and his wife, Nihal, have lived here two years. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=218.0s)]
*  When you came back here after the shelling, what did you see? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=223.84s)]
*  What did you think? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=227.64s)]
*  We couldn't hold back our tears when we came back here. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=230.28s)]
*  We're not nomads, but what could we do? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=233.8s)]
*  No electricity, no running water. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=238.04s)]
*  Fifteen families in the Zaydan building alone. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=241.4s)]
*  When the mix flights up, 70-year-old Najah Zaydan burns rags to cook. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  There's no fuel, no trees. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=253.72s)]
*  The ceiling looks exhausted, and winter comes this week. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=256.32s)]
*  We'd like to show you the immensity, but we can't, because the ruins run for miles in [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=263.8s)]
*  every direction. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  This is what you would see in most every Syrian city. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=272.64000000000004s)]
*  To stay in power, Assad left his people to starve, so Mohammed Zaydan built a furrow [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=277.32s)]
*  from broken bricks to farm radishes, spring onions, and coriander. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=284.12s)]
*  When you first heard that Assad was gone, could you believe it? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=290.76s)]
*  We felt like everyone else, like we were in a bad dream and finally woke up. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=298.36s)]
*  She said, we're still in shock. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  Is he gone for real? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=307.8s)]
*  On the road, the signposts of history tell the backstory. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=311.8s)]
*  Hafez al-Assad, the father, ruled from 1970. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  The bullet holes give you a sense of how he's remembered. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=320.6s)]
*  Then in the year 2000, the son, Bashar, continued the brutal police state. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=325.6s)]
*  We've been covering the civil war for 12 years. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=334.36s)]
*  It began with an exodus of millions. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=338.24s)]
*  At the time, the greatest humanitarian catastrophe since World War II. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=344.24s)]
*  This burm marks the border between Syria and Jordan. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  The refugees that we ran into were coming across the top of the burm and turning themselves [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=353.68s)]
*  into the safety of the Jordanian border officers here. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=358.56s)]
*  We reported on the relentless bombardment of civilians and the rescue work of Syrians [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=365.96s)]
*  known as the White Helmets, their civil defense volunteers who have given thousands a second [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=373.28s)]
*  chance at life. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=381.8s)]
*  We covered Assad's 2013 nerve gas and chemical attacks that killed an estimated 1,400 civilians. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  By 2015, Russia and Iran had joined the war to prop up Assad's forces. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=396.68s)]
*  In the Russian airstrikes saved Assad, and we saw bombed hospitals in rebel territory, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=403.68s)]
*  a war crime. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=410.2s)]
*  Everyone's afraid of being beside a hospital because they know the hospital's going to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  be a target of an airstrike. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=417.52s)]
*  And with half a million Syrians dead, we met a generation of orphans. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=420.24s)]
*  Last year, we reported on Syrians' left destitute by a massive earthquake in rebel territory. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  Until this fall, the rebels had been cornered in the north. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  Assad had all but won the war. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  But this month, his allies abandoned him. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  Vladimir Putin had exhausted Russian forces in Ukraine. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  Iran was fighting Israel. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  So three weeks ago, the rebels saw the chance and swept through the major cities to Damascus. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=456.32s)]
*  Assad's army, hollowed out by corruption, simply ran away. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=464.32s)]
*  The dictator fled to Moscow. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=470.32s)]
*  We found nearly all you need to know about Assad's rule in Examination Room 2 at Damascus Hospital. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=474.32s)]
*  These corpses are Assad's prisoners from a notorious jail. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=483.36s)]
*  Dr. Ayman Nasser told us that he received 35 bodies. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=490.36s)]
*  There is one with severe signs of torture, he said. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=496.36s)]
*  Many of the bodies show signs of malnutrition or lack of oxygen from overcrowding in the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=500.36s)]
*  places where they were kept. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=506.36s)]
*  The cause of death was most likely multiple organ failure caused by malnutrition. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  Starved to death in a prison, they were the last to die of untold thousands of political [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=516.4s)]
*  opponents who vanished into Assad's jails over the decades. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=524.4s)]
*  When word spread on Facebook that 35 were here, the desperate came searching for the damned. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=529.4s)]
*  Who are you looking for? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=538.4s)]
*  Faisa Hussein al-Ali's son was arrested. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=544.4s)]
*  There are so many like my son, from our village alone, about 70 prisoners. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=549.4s)]
*  We are drowning in sorrow, our hearts are burning. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=558.4s)]
*  I am like every mother here, crushed by pain every day. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=563.4s)]
*  The regime killed two of my sons. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=568.4s)]
*  One was killed by a sniper for no reason. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=571.4s)]
*  The other died rescuing survivors from airstrikes when planes bombed them again. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=574.4s)]
*  And he had a girl and a boy. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=581.4s)]
*  Who are you looking for? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=584.4s)]
*  My son, Susan Altunji told us. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=587.4s)]
*  Like many, she received a death certificate from the prison years ago, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=591.4s)]
*  but no body, no proof. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=595.4399999999999s)]
*  How long has he been missing? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  12 years. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=600.4399999999999s)]
*  I pray I find him. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  Even if he's dead, it's okay, just give me the body. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=604.4399999999999s)]
*  All I want is to find some rest. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  Forensic pathologists compare photos and teeth. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=613.4399999999999s)]
*  This doctor asks a relative, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  Do you have a picture of him smiling? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=620.4399999999999s)]
*  In this way, they have identified 18 so far. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=622.48s)]
*  Dr. Nasser told us, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=627.48s)]
*  We empathize and we do our best to help, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=629.48s)]
*  but the pressure from the families is overwhelming. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=632.48s)]
*  We saw that when we met the rage of people who have never known justice. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=637.48s)]
*  Taghrid al-Badawi's son disappeared 12 years ago. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=644.48s)]
*  This is a war crime. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=649.48s)]
*  This is a war crime. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=650.52s)]
*  Assad is a war criminal. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=652.52s)]
*  Someone like him should die like a dog. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=654.52s)]
*  He and the Assad family should be executed for the horrors we now see. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=658.52s)]
*  Who is this, sir? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=668.52s)]
*  This is my son, he told us, arrested in 2013. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=670.52s)]
*  They took him at a checkpoint. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=675.52s)]
*  He was driving a bus for a living. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=677.52s)]
*  Who is this? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=679.56s)]
*  This is your brother? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=681.56s)]
*  What is his name? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=684.56s)]
*  In 2012, her brother was arrested on his way to a store. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=686.56s)]
*  They gave us his ID card and told my mother never to ask about him again. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=693.56s)]
*  They're a bunch of butchers. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=699.56s)]
*  Who is this? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=701.56s)]
*  My brother. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=702.56s)]
*  And how long has he been missing? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=703.56s)]
*  13 years now. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=706.56s)]
*  13 years. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=707.5999999999999s)]
*  In the prison, you did not find him here? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=709.5999999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=712.5999999999999s)]
*  Do you have hope that you will find him? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=713.5999999999999s)]
*  We do have hope, he said. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=716.5999999999999s)]
*  God willing. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=719.5999999999999s)]
*  Hope and apprehension are spilling into the streets of Damascus. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=720.5999999999999s)]
*  Most of this city of about 2.5 million people is intact because this was the dictator's stronghold. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=726.5999999999999s)]
*  No one under the age of 54 has ever known freedom, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=733.64s)]
*  has ever been able to speak of politics above a whisper. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=738.64s)]
*  That's a tough memory to break. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=743.64s)]
*  One man told us, we got Assad out of Syria. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=745.64s)]
*  Now we have to get him out of us. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=749.64s)]
*  There was joy in the crowd headed for Friday prayers. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=754.64s)]
*  75% of Syrians are from the largest branch of Islam, the Sunnis, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=758.68s)]
*  and the rebel leaders are Sunni fundamentalists. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=763.68s)]
*  But no one knows yet how minority Muslim sects and Christians will be protected. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=767.68s)]
*  The leader of the rebels is 42-year-old Ahmed al-Shara. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=774.68s)]
*  In 2013, the U.S. named him a terrorist and later put a $10 million bounty on his head [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=778.68s)]
*  but so far al-Shara has kept order. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=787.7199999999999s)]
*  There's little sign of destruction, looting or reprisals and government workers are on the job. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=790.7199999999999s)]
*  The people do not know yet how they will be governed. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=798.7199999999999s)]
*  Peace seems to be in the hearts of many, but the shooting hasn't stopped entirely. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=802.7199999999999s)]
*  Israel last week grabbed the chance to bomb what's left of Syria's military. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=810.7199999999999s)]
*  The U.S. is hitting remnants of ISIS terrorists in central Syria. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=816.76s)]
*  As for Russia, satellite pictures of its major naval base on Syria's Mediterranean coast [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=822.76s)]
*  now reveal that the ships are gone. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=829.76s)]
*  Back where we began, in the Damascus suburb of Eintarma, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=835.76s)]
*  we saw the immensity of what lies ahead. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=839.76s)]
*  It will take hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild Syria, and Syria is destitute. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=843.8s)]
*  Mohammed Zaydan and his wife are resigned to live here. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=850.8s)]
*  Besides, a new home is not what they want the most. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=855.8s)]
*  They want their 39-year-old son. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=859.8s)]
*  In 2012, he was stopped at an Assad regime checkpoint and they never heard from him again. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=862.8s)]
*  What does that mean for your lives now? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=869.8s)]
*  That Assad is gone. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=872.8399999999999s)]
*  This feels like a new birth, a new beginning. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=875.8399999999999s)]
*  Though my hair has turned gray and my time has passed, we feel, thank God, young again. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=878.8399999999999s)]
*  We hope by the hands of our young people, God willing, it will be better than it was before. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=888.8399999999999s)]
*  A new Syria is likely to be built by the kind of people who look out on despair and somehow see a future. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=895.88s)]
*  Experience tells Syrians they have no reason to hope that freedom will last, and yet that hope endures. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=904.88s)]
*  In October last year, a 14-year-old girl named Francesca Mani was sitting in her high school history class [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=914.92s)]
*  when she heard a rumor that some boys had naked photos of female classmates. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=920.92s)]
*  She soon learned her picture was among them, but the images were doctored, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=925.92s)]
*  created with artificial intelligence using what's known as a Nudify website or app. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=929.92s)]
*  The image was then taken by a woman who was a student of the school. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=934.92s)]
*  The Nudify website was created with artificial intelligence using what's known as a Nudify website or app, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=939.9599999999999s)]
*  which turns real photos of someone fully clothed into real-looking nudes. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=945.9599999999999s)]
*  We've found nearly 30 similar incidents in schools in the US over the last 20 months, and plenty more around the world. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=950.9599999999999s)]
*  We want to warn you, some of what you'll hear and see is disturbing, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=957.9599999999999s)]
*  but we think unveiling these Nudify websites is important, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=961.9599999999999s)]
*  because they're not hidden on the dark web. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=965.96s)]
*  They're openly advertised, easy to use, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=968.46s)]
*  and as Francesca Mani found out, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=971.3000000000001s)]
*  there isn't much that's been done to stop them. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=973.1s)]
*  When you first heard the rumor, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=976.76s)]
*  you didn't know that there were photos or a photo of you. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=978.1s)]
*  No, we didn't know. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=981.2s)]
*  I think that was, like, the most chaotic day [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=982.4000000000001s)]
*  I've ever witnessed. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=984.3000000000001s)]
*  In a school, somebody gets an inkling of something, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=985.5s)]
*  and it just spreads. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=989.0s)]
*  It's like rapid fire. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=990.0s)]
*  It just goes through everyone. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=991.2s)]
*  And so then when someone hears this, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=993.4399999999999s)]
*  it's like, wait, like, AI? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=996.3s)]
*  Like, no one thinks that could, like, happen to you. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=999.0s)]
*  Francesca Mani knew nothing about Nutafy websites [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1002.34s)]
*  when she discovered she and several of the girls [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1005.1999999999999s)]
*  at Westfield High School in New Jersey had been targeted. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1007.56s)]
*  According to a lawsuit later filed by one of the other girls [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1010.6999999999999s)]
*  through her parents, a boy at the school [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1013.8s)]
*  uploaded photos from Instagram to a site called Cloth Off. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1016.04s)]
*  We're naming the site to raise awareness [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1020.34s)]
*  of its potential dangers. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1022.38s)]
*  There are more than 100 of these Nutafy websites. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1024.44s)]
*  A quick search is all it takes to find them. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1027.08s)]
*  Cloth Off is one of the most popular, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1029.78s)]
*  with more than 3 million visits last month, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1031.88s)]
*  according to Graphica, a company that analyzes social networks. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1034.28s)]
*  It now offers to Nutafy males as well, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1038.28s)]
*  but female nudes are far more popular. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1040.88s)]
*  Have someone to undress, Cloth Off's website asks. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1043.6s)]
*  You can upload a photo or get a free demonstration [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1046.74s)]
*  in which an image of a woman appears with clothes on, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1049.8s)]
*  then a few seconds later, her clothes are gone. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1053.1599999999999s)]
*  We're blurring it out, but the results look very real. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1056.6399999999999s)]
*  Francesca Mani never saw what had been done to her photo, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1060.5s)]
*  but according to that lawsuit, at least one girl's AI nude [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1063.86s)]
*  was shared on Snapchat and seen by several kids at school. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1067.1599999999999s)]
*  What made it worse, Francesca says, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1071.3s)]
*  is that she and the other girls found out [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1073.36s)]
*  they were the victims when they were called by name [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1075.3999999999999s)]
*  to the principal's office over the school's [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1077.96s)]
*  public address system. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1080.32s)]
*  I feel like that was a major violation of our privacy [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1081.9s)]
*  while the bad actors were taken out of their classes privately. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1085.32s)]
*  When I left the principal's office, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1090.66s)]
*  I was walking through a hallway, and I saw this group of boys [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1092.3600000000001s)]
*  laughing at these group of girls crying, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1096.6200000000001s)]
*  and that's when I realized I should stop crying [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1098.56s)]
*  and be mad because this is unacceptable. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1101.16s)]
*  That afternoon, Westfield's principal [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1103.9s)]
*  sent this email to all high school parents, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1105.8s)]
*  informing them, some of our students [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1108.36s)]
*  had used artificial intelligence to create [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1110.7s)]
*  pornographic images from original photos. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1113.0s)]
*  The principal also said the school was investigating, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1115.86s)]
*  and at this time, we believe that any created images [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1118.54s)]
*  have been deleted and are not being circulated. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1122.1s)]
*  Francesca's mom, Dorota, who's also an educator, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1125.1599999999999s)]
*  was not convinced. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1128.36s)]
*  Do you think they did enough? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1129.74s)]
*  Well, I don't know, Anderson, you work in television. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1131.5s)]

*  who knows where these images may be? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1141.54s)]
*  Who printed it, who screenshotted it, who downloaded it, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1143.3999999999999s)]

*  She was shocked by the school's handling of the whole incident. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1151.84s)]
*  The principal informed me that one boy receives one day [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1155.04s)]
*  suspension, and that was it. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1160.1s)]

*  going to be any other consequences? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1165.08s)]

*  The school district wouldn't confirm details [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1171.94s)]
*  about the photos, the students involved, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1174.04s)]

*  under 18 or over 18? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1233.82s)]
*  You'll see as we click Accept that there's no verification. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1235.52s)]

*  And immediately you're getting very explicit photos. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1240.82s)]
*  And then they have the poses feature, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1243.6399999999999s)]
*  which is one of their new settings, which [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1245.04s)]

*  We haven't locked it. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1253.18s)]

*  to promote their services on social media. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1256.68s)]

*  before and after AI nudes. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1261.68s)]
*  I've even seen on social media platforms people showing [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1263.8400000000001s)]
*  before and after photos of what are clearly [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1266.7800000000002s)]
*  like high school girls. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1268.7600000000002s)]
*  And I've like reverse image searched the original photo. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1269.8400000000001s)]
*  And they're like high school girls like swim meets. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1273.0800000000002s)]
*  And see, these are very clearly, these are minors. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1275.3200000000002s)]
*  And adult content is being made of them, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1277.72s)]
*  not consensually, then also being posted on social media. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1279.52s)]
*  I think a lot of parents would be surprised to learn [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1282.2s)]
*  that you post a picture of your child on your Instagram account. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1284.24s)]
*  Your child could end up naked photo of your child out there. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1288.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1290.72s)]
*  And so you have a registration. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1291.48s)]
*  To Nudify a photo on Clothoff is free the first time. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1293.12s)]
*  After that, it costs from $2 to $40. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1297.0s)]
*  The payment options often change, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1299.8s)]
*  but there are always plenty to choose from. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1301.92s)]
*  It's given me everything from crypto [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1304.72s)]
*  to using a credit card for a variety of different credit [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1306.32s)]
*  cards. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1308.6s)]
*  We got PayPal here, Google Pay. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1309.2s)]
*  I would imagine some of these companies [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1311.92s)]
*  are not thrilled that their services are [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1313.6000000000001s)]
*  being used by these websites. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1317.4s)]
*  Yeah, and in many of these cases, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1319.2s)]
*  it directly violates their policies. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1320.56s)]
*  To trick online payment services, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1322.88s)]
*  Colina Coltai says Clothoff and other Nudify sites [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1324.76s)]
*  redirect their customers' payments [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1328.0800000000002s)]
*  through phony websites like these, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1330.28s)]
*  pretending to sell flowers and photography lessons. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1332.3600000000001s)]
*  Say, for example, you want to pay through PayPal. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1335.56s)]
*  So we click this, and it'll take a second. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1337.6s)]
*  So it's now redirecting you. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1340.3999999999999s)]
*  It's redirecting through a dummy website. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1342.3999999999999s)]
*  So that way, on PayPal's end, it looks [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1345.6799999999998s)]
*  like you may be purchasing anything from motorcycles [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1347.1599999999999s)]
*  or beekeeping lessons or roller blade lessons. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1349.8s)]
*  And so now we got to a PayPal screen. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1352.6799999999998s)]
*  But we can see down here, it says cancel and return [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1355.24s)]
*  to internookdesigns.motorcycles. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1358.0s)]
*  So that's what PayPal is being told [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1360.44s)]
*  is the website that's asking for the charge. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1362.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1365.24s)]
*  PayPal told us it banned Clothoff from its platforms [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1366.2s)]
*  a year ago and shuts down the accounts [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1369.4s)]
*  for these redirect sites when it finds them. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1371.8s)]
*  The problem is Clothoff often just creates new ones. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1374.32s)]
*  On this login screen here. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1377.92s)]
*  And that's not the only deception it relies on. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1379.8400000000001s)]
*  Its website lists a name, Grupo Digital, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1382.4s)]
*  with an address in Buenos Aires, Argentina, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1385.72s)]
*  implying that's where Clothoff is based. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1388.64s)]
*  But when we sent our cameras, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1391.6000000000001s)]
*  there was no Grupo Digital there. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1393.32s)]
*  It turned out to be the office of a YouTube channel [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1395.8799999999999s)]
*  that covers politics. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1398.84s)]
*  And when we knocked on the door, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1400.48s)]
*  the employee who answered said she'd never heard of Clothoff. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1404.6399999999999s)]
*  Clothoff also made up a fake CEO, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1411.9599999999998s)]
*  according to Colina Coltay, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1414.6s)]
*  complete with what she says is an AI-generated headshot. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1416.3999999999999s)]
*  There is a really inherent shadiness that's happening. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1420.1599999999999s)]
*  They're not being transparent about who owns it. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1423.04s)]
*  They're obviously trying to mask their payments. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1425.4s)]
*  But you look at the sophistication [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1427.4s)]
*  of these really large sites, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1428.5600000000002s)]
*  it's completely different than say some guy in a basement [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1430.0s)]
*  that set up a site that is trying to do it on his own. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1432.8400000000001s)]
*  When these sites launched [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1434.8000000000002s)]
*  and the way that they've been developing [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1436.0800000000002s)]
*  and going this past year, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1437.48s)]
*  it is not someone's first road. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1438.8000000000002s)]
*  It's not the first time they set up a complex network. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1440.0400000000002s)]
*  Clothoff claims on its website [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1443.68s)]
*  that processing of miners is impossible. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1445.48s)]
*  We emailed what the site says is a press contact [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1448.3200000000002s)]
*  asking for any evidence of that [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1451.24s)]
*  and to respond to a number of other questions. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1453.3999999999999s)]
*  We didn't hear back. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1456.04s)]
*  A lot of people might say, well, these images are fake, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1457.6s)]
*  but we know victims will suffer humiliation. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1460.36s)]
*  They'll suffer mental health distress and reputational harm. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1463.8s)]
*  In a school setting, it's really amplified [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1469.1599999999999s)]
*  because one of their peers has created this imagery. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1471.24s)]
*  So there's a loss of confidence, a loss of trust. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1475.04s)]
*  Yotasouris is chief legal officer at the National Center [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1478.4399999999998s)]

*  In at least three cases, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1489.6000000000001s)]
*  Snapchat was reportedly used to circulate these photos. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1490.5600000000002s)]
*  One instance, the parent told us [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1494.3600000000001s)]
*  that it took more than eight months [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1496.2s)]
*  to get the accounts that had shared the images taken down. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1497.88s)]
*  Their responsiveness to victims, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1501.64s)]
*  that is a recurring problem that we see across tech companies. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1503.6000000000001s)]
*  So it's not as easy as a parent [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1507.24s)]
*  sending a note through Snapchat, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1510.28s)]
*  hey, this is happening, my child has been exploited. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1511.96s)]
*  It's entirely unclear why it is not a faster process. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1515.24s)]
*  We can actually notify tech companies as well [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1519.2s)]
*  and ask them to take that content down. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1521.56s)]
*  And in individuals, do they? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1523.4s)]
*  Much faster than when an individual calls, yes. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1525.0s)]
*  That isn't the way it should be, right? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1528.32s)]
*  I mean, a parent whose child has exploitative [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1530.32s)]
*  or child pornography images online [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1533.2s)]
*  should not have to rely on reaching out to a third party [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1535.4s)]
*  and having them call the tech company. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1538.68s)]
*  The tech company should be assuming responsibility [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1540.4s)]
*  immediately to remove that content. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1543.1200000000001s)]
*  Why are they not doing that? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1545.16s)]
*  Because they do not think there are ramifications [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1546.48s)]
*  to them not doing so. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1548.92s)]
*  Social media companies are shielded from lawsuits [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1551.0s)]
*  involving photos someone posts online [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1553.5200000000002s)]
*  due to what Iota Suras considers an outdated law. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1555.88s)]
*  Under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1559.24s)]
*  a law from 1996, so very different world back then, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1562.24s)]
*  online platforms have near complete immunity [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1566.32s)]
*  for any liability arising from content [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1570.0s)]
*  that a user puts on their system. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1572.56s)]
*  The section 230 protection is really what allows [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1574.8799999999999s)]
*  this very loose ecosystem to exist [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1578.72s)]
*  in terms of Nutifi apps and websites [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1582.6799999999998s)]
*  that cause harm to children. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1585.32s)]
*  We asked Snapchat about that parent [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1586.9199999999998s)]
*  who told us the company didn't respond to her [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1588.8s)]
*  for eight months. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1590.8799999999999s)]
*  A Snapchat spokesperson told us they've been unable [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1592.08s)]
*  to locate her request and said in part, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1594.68s)]
*  we have efficient mechanisms for reporting [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1597.6000000000001s)]
*  this kind of content and added, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1599.8400000000001s)]
*  we have a zero tolerance policy for such content [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1601.96s)]
*  and act quickly to address it once reported. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1604.92s)]
*  AI nudes of minors are illegal [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1608.44s)]
*  under federal child pornography laws [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1610.5600000000002s)]

*  If they depict what's defined as sexually explicit conduct. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1614.44s)]
*  But Suras is concerned some images created by Nutifi sites [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1618.5600000000002s)]
*  may not meet that definition. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1622.68s)]
*  There's this gap in the law around a Nutifi app [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1624.72s)]
*  that desperately needs to be shut. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1627.8400000000001s)]
*  What are the gaps in the law? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1629.68s)]
*  Currently a nude image of a child [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1631.0800000000002s)]
*  that does not include sexually explicit conduct [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1633.3600000000001s)]
*  is not illegal. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1636.88s)]
*  And that is a serious gap that exists for real children [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1638.64s)]
*  and that exists certainly for images of new children [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1641.48s)]
*  that are created by a Nutifi app. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1644.6000000000001s)]
*  Send a clear message that what the boys had done. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1646.3200000000002s)]
*  In the years since Francesca Mani found out [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1649.72s)]
*  she was targeted, she and her mom have urged schools [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1651.84s)]
*  to implement policies around AI [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1654.72s)]
*  and worked with members of Congress [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1657.12s)]
*  to try and pass a number of federal bills. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1658.6799999999998s)]
*  The Take It Down Act does two things. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1661.24s)]
*  The Take It Down Act, co-sponsored by Senators Ted Cruz [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1662.84s)]
*  and Amy Klobuchar made it through the Senate this month [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1665.8799999999999s)]
*  and is now awaiting a vote in the House. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1668.8799999999999s)]
*  It would create criminal penalties for sharing AI nudes [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1671.28s)]
*  and require social media companies to take photos down [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1674.8s)]
*  within 48 hours of getting a request. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1678.12s)]
*  Schools don't really know how to address this. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1681.04s)]
*  Police, in many cases, don't do much at this stage [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1683.48s)]
*  and the sites are making, I presume, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1687.8799999999999s)]
*  millions of dollars off this. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1690.04s)]
*  So can it be fixed? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1692.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1693.28s)]
*  If we have the appropriate laws, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1694.1599999999999s)]
*  we will have the criminal consequences, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1696.08s)]
*  first of all to deter offenders, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1699.1599999999999s)]
*  and then they'll be held liable [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1700.84s)]
*  if they are still using these apps. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1702.24s)]
*  We would have civil remedies for victims. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1704.08s)]
*  Schools would have protocols. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1705.96s)]
*  Investigators and law enforcement would have roadmaps [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1708.24s)]
*  on how to investigate what charges to bring. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1710.56s)]
*  But we're a long way from that. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1712.9199999999998s)]
*  We just need the laws in place. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1714.1599999999999s)]
*  All the rest will come from that. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1715.8799999999999s)]
*  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1718.56s)]
*  tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1724.56s)]
*  In Greek mythology, Hermes, the son of Zeus, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1729.56s)]
*  was imagined with winged sandals and a winged hat, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1732.08s)]
*  symbols of his celebrated speed. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1735.3999999999999s)]
*  Today, the French fashion house Hermes that shares his name [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1738.12s)]
*  is also known for its accessories, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1742.12s)]
*  elegant scarves, ties, and handbags, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1744.6399999999999s)]
*  all meticulously made, but at a glacial pace. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1747.52s)]
*  It can take years for moneyed customers [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1751.36s)]
*  to get their hands in certain Hermes handbags, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1753.8s)]
*  a process steeped in more mythology [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1757.0s)]
*  than even the Greeks could have imagined. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1759.3999999999999s)]
*  The craft and culture behind the brand has been preserved [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1761.76s)]
*  for nearly 200 years by one family [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1765.36s)]

*  But this spring, we were invited to Paris [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1771.08s)]
*  to spend some time behind the silk curtains [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1773.4399999999998s)]
*  of the house of Hermes. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1776.12s)]
*  On a rainy afternoon, we watched as Pierre-Alexis Dumas, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1780.6799999999998s)]
*  the artistic director of Hermes, turned his discerning eye [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1784.48s)]
*  to dozens of potential scarf designs. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1787.8799999999999s)]
*  Mettez-vous là. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1790.8s)]

*  the world's chicest clothesline. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1794.92s)]

*  some designs two years in the making. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1800.92s)]
*  The only part of the process that happens quickly is this. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1804.3600000000001s)]
*  Dumas shows the colors for next season scarves [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1808.2s)]

*  In 1837, Thierry Hermes began selling [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1828.44s)]
*  bespoke harnesses in Paris. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1831.72s)]

*  Hermes is a more than $200 billion luxury brand [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1839.2s)]
*  with a catalog that includes everything from ready to wear [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1843.4s)]

*  When I was a child, his office just on the first floor, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1869.24s)]
*  now it's the jewelry section. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1872.48s)]
*  The store is like the Louvre of luxury goods, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1874.6s)]
*  complete with reminders to look but don't touch. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1877.56s)]
*  The brand's masterpieces include this $48,000 purse [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1881.6399999999999s)]
*  and if you have money left over, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1885.8799999999999s)]
*  this $272,000 pool table. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1887.6799999999998s)]
*  Do you ever make a decision based on cost, budget? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1891.6799999999998s)]
*  This will be less expensive if we do it this way. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1897.04s)]
*  I can't work like that. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1899.3999999999999s)]
*  I've always heard that Hermes is very costly. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1901.08s)]
*  It's not expensive, it's costly. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1905.56s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1908.0s)]
*  The cost is the actual price of making an object properly [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1909.04s)]
*  with the required level of attention [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1915.76s)]
*  so that you have an object of quality. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1918.3999999999999s)]
*  Expensive is a product which is not delivering [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1920.48s)]
*  what it's supposed to deliver, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1926.04s)]
*  but you've paid quite a large amount of money for it [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1928.08s)]
*  and then it betrays you. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1931.1599999999999s)]
*  That's expensive. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1932.8s)]
*  A distinctly French philosophy stitched into the DNA [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1934.2s)]
*  of Hermes. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1938.32s)]
*  Dumas says the company has never had a marketing department. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1939.9199999999998s)]
*  It's a lure, he says, comes from a century [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1943.4399999999998s)]
*  of superb craftsmanship and serendipity. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1946.36s)]
*  Take this trapezoid-shaped purse. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1950.2s)]
*  In 1935, Dumas' grandfather designed the bag. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1952.6399999999999s)]
*  It wasn't a hit, but his legend has it, 20 years later, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1956.24s)]
*  in expecting Grace Kelly used the bag [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1960.32s)]
*  to hide her belly from peering paparazzi. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1962.8799999999999s)]
*  Soon, women fled at Hermes, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1966.2s)]
*  asking for what was eventually renamed the Kelly bag. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1968.3200000000002s)]
*  Hermes scarves had been favored by American royalty [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1972.3600000000001s)]
*  and actual royalty for decades, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1975.24s)]
*  the kind of product placement money can't buy. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1977.64s)]
*  Even the brand's famous citrus-colored boxes, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1980.88s)]
*  a color the company trademarked in the US, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1983.8000000000002s)]
*  was a happy accident of the 1940s. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1986.5600000000002s)]
*  In 1946, there was shortage of everything [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1989.4s)]
*  and when my great uncle went to see his supplier [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1992.68s)]
*  of paper manufacturing boxes, the supplier said, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1996.2800000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry, we don't have that beige paper anymore. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=1999.0s)]
*  Because of the war? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2001.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, because of the war and short supplies. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2002.5200000000002s)]
*  And he said, I only have that stock [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2004.6000000000001s)]
*  of that roll of orange paper that nobody wants. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2007.2s)]
*  Eyes light up when they see that orange. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2010.5600000000002s)]
*  Serendipity. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2012.16s)]
*  And it was serendipity that led [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2013.48s)]
*  to the pièce de résistance at Hermes, the Birkin, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2015.68s)]
*  designed in 1984 by Dumas' father, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2019.52s)]
*  after he was seated next to British actress, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2022.56s)]
*  Jane Birkin, on a flight to London. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2025.2s)]
*  And she told him, well, let me tell you, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2027.84s)]
*  I'm not happy about my bag. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2030.04s)]
*  I want something more loose with bigger handles [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2032.56s)]
*  and always open when I carry it. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2035.44s)]
*  And as she was talking, my father was very good at sketching. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2038.88s)]
*  He sketched it right there in that moment. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2042.48s)]
*  Yeah, but just an idea, you know, a bit something like that. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2044.32s)]
*  He said, yeah, that would be great. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2047.16s)]
*  It was. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2049.04s)]
*  Today, the Birkin is the most coveted [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2049.88s)]
*  and costly handbag in the world. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2052.12s)]
*  A Birkin retails around $9,000 and at auction [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2054.72s)]
*  can fetch upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2058.68s)]
*  But here is the surreal twist of Hermes' exclusivity. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2062.16s)]
*  Even if you can afford to buy a Birkin bag, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2066.52s)]
*  chances are you can't. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2069.6s)]
*  The stores typically don't have any to sell. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2071.8s)]
*  Dumas says Hermes simply can't keep up with demand. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2075.24s)]
*  Somebody wants the bag. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2079.8s)]
*  How do they get the bag? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2081.16s)]
*  Well, you have to walk into an Hermes store [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2082.36s)]
*  and you have to be patient. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2084.64s)]
*  But you know the world we live in, right? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2086.88s)]
*  You know that if somebody has the funds [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2088.4s)]
*  and they want the bag, they want the bag now. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2091.32s)]
*  Yes, I have children too and I have desires too. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2095.16s)]
*  But I'm saying it's a long process. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2100.88s)]
*  You go to a store, you get an appointment, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2103.16s)]
*  you meet a salesperson, you talk about what you want. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2105.2400000000002s)]
*  You'll have to wait, it'll come back to you. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2107.92s)]
*  It takes a long time. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2111.1600000000003s)]
*  Eventually it's gonna happen. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2112.2400000000002s)]
*  Store managers act as gatekeepers [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2114.04s)]
*  for disciples of the brand. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2117.0s)]
*  There are stories of years-long waiting lists for bags [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2119.48s)]
*  and waiting lists to get on the waiting list, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2122.7200000000003s)]
*  along with whispers from Wall Street [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2125.36s)]
*  that the company is brilliantly gaming the customer. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2127.56s)]
*  Hermes has been accused of creating [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2131.48s)]
*  this artificial scarcity to pump up demand. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2134.28s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2139.48s)]
*  It makes me smile that this is [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2140.6400000000003s)]
*  a diabolical marketing idea [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2145.5600000000004s)]
*  that can only come out of people obsessed with marketing. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2150.2000000000003s)]
*  But we don't have a marketing department at Hermes. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2155.0800000000004s)]
*  So first of all, when I heard that, I was like, what? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2157.1200000000003s)]
*  Oh, okay, I get it. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2160.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, no. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2162.7599999999998s)]
*  Whatever we have, we put on the shelf and it goes. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2165.3999999999996s)]
*  There's not a room where you guys are holding [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2167.8399999999997s)]
*  all the bags back and saying, let's see what happens. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2169.8799999999997s)]
*  Maybe we should. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2172.3599999999997s)]
*  The simple truth, Dumas says, is that Hermes [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2174.48s)]
*  doesn't have enough artisans to build the bags, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2177.6s)]
*  which for a century, he says, have been made [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2180.48s)]
*  from start to finish by a single craftsman. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2183.2799999999997s)]
*  So I always like to say that Hermes is an old lady [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2186.3199999999997s)]
*  with startup issues, because we've grown so fast [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2189.68s)]
*  in such a small period. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2193.56s)]
*  How can you grow so fast without changing [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2195.6s)]
*  what makes you strong? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2199.8399999999997s)]
*  How can you grow so fast without changing your values? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2201.2799999999997s)]
*  By training people, training a lot of people [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2205.04s)]
*  for a profession which will be their life profession. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2208.3599999999997s)]
*  They will finish their career at Hermes. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2212.68s)]
*  In 2021, the house opened a training center in Leatherwork [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2215.48s)]
*  where 400 graduates a year are schooled in the art [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2220.28s)]
*  of savoir-faire, or know-how, making things by hand. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2222.84s)]
*  That includes mastering Hermes' signature saddle stitch. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2227.36s)]
*  When you have a carriage which is pulled by five horses, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2231.48s)]
*  you better make sure that all the equipment you're using [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2234.64s)]
*  is going to be strong. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2238.76s)]
*  So saddle stitching techniques were not about trying [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2240.64s)]
*  to be hidden, they were about being strong and functional. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2244.92s)]
*  Today, it is a hallmark of the Hermes bags. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2250.44s)]
*  And here is a stitch. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2253.44s)]
*  Dumas learned to saddle stitch as a boy upstairs [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2255.56s)]
*  at the Faubourg in the workshop [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2258.36s)]
*  where they still build saddles today. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2260.48s)]
*  He thought it was the perfect place for a lesson. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2263.08s)]
*  You're gonna hold by applying a gentle pressure [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2266.16s)]
*  with your legs. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2269.32s)]
*  With my thighs? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2270.16s)]
*  Yes, your thighs. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2271.0s)]
*  You're gonna be able to hold that little piece of leather [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2272.2400000000002s)]
*  so that your hands are free to stitch. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2275.44s)]
*  With needles in both hands, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2278.12s)]
*  you're supposed to pull a strong linen thread [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2279.88s)]
*  coated in beeswax into precise loops. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2283.08s)]
*  So I have to have the hands of a heart surgeon [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2286.56s)]
*  and the thighs of a professional wrestler, right? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2288.8399999999997s)]
*  That's a very extreme, but yes, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2291.44s)]
*  if you manage to do that, you got a job. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2293.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2295.8399999999997s)]
*  Hermes says the crisscross of needles that make the knot [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2297.2799999999997s)]
*  can't be replicated by a machine [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2300.12s)]
*  and can take years to master. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2302.24s)]
*  But those who do are typically offered positions [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2304.44s)]
*  at one of 23 leather workshops [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2307.2799999999997s)]
*  that Hermes has built in villages and towns all over France. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2309.3999999999996s)]
*  This is one of them, in Torn, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2313.6s)]
*  a three hour drive from Paris in the French countryside. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2316.08s)]
*  The workshop is quiet. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2319.8399999999997s)]
*  There is no jamming of sewing machines, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2321.56s)]
*  just artisans performing a silent dance [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2323.8799999999997s)]
*  with dueling needles. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2326.3999999999996s)]
*  The morning we visited, we met Amandine [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2328.2799999999997s)]
*  and watched as she put the finishing touches on a Kelly, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2330.9599999999996s)]
*  the most difficult bag to build. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2334.3199999999997s)]
*  It starts with 30 distinct cuts of leather [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2336.6s)]
*  and can take 20 hours to complete, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2340.7599999999998s)]
*  four hours for just the handle. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2343.24s)]
*  There are no manuals or cheat sheets. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2345.48s)]
*  Artisans rely on their training [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2348.48s)]
*  and muscle memory to make every bag. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2350.68s)]
*  Which bags do you know how to make? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2353.52s)]
*  The Kelly, the Birkin, the Lindy, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2355.32s)]
*  the Gypsiere, the Schouder. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2359.88s)]
*  That you've memorized. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2363.12s)]
*  She told us she started making bags at Hermes 15 years ago [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2365.32s)]
*  and went through two years of training. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2369.12s)]
*  So you're able to talk to me [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2371.16s)]
*  and do a saddle stitch at the same time? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2373.48s)]
*  Oui, c'est possible. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2375.84s)]
*  No one seems to be rushing at the workshop. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2377.36s)]
*  The pace is leisurely. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2380.08s)]
*  No looming clocks or quotas, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2381.68s)]
*  just the slow pursuit of perfection. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2383.84s)]
*  And when the bag is completed... [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2387.04s)]
*  Do you have a special stamp you put in the bag? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2389.08s)]
*  Oui, nous signons notre sac. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2391.68s)]
*  Yes, we do, she said, but it's a secret. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2394.52s)]
*  A secret because that hidden mark of the artisan [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2397.52s)]
*  is how Hermes bags are authenticated. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2400.8799999999997s)]
*  By creating their own pipeline of craftsmen, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2404.7599999999998s)]
*  Hermes says they've been able to produce [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2407.68s)]
*  more of their coveted handbags than ever. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2409.16s)]
*  Although they won't disclose the exact number, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2411.9199999999996s)]
*  that too is a secret. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2414.48s)]
*  This year, some customers were so exasperated [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2417.3999999999996s)]
*  by all the mystery and their years-long odyssey [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2420.2s)]
*  that they need to secure a Birkin, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2422.92s)]
*  they've sued Hermes. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2424.7200000000003s)]
*  Pierre-Alexis Dumas says building something timeless [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2426.56s)]
*  takes time. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2429.6s)]
*  He urged patience while nearly losing it with us. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2430.96s)]
*  If I went to the Mercedes dealership [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2434.8s)]
*  and I said I would like that car, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2436.88s)]
*  and they said, okay, you're going to have to wait five years, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2439.0s)]
*  they'd be out of business. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2442.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you're talking about industrial production. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2443.44s)]
*  You're applying your thinking structure [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2445.8s)]
*  of industrial production to craft. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2448.1600000000003s)]
*  We're about craft. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2451.1600000000003s)]
*  We're about machines. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2453.08s)]
*  And we are not compromising on the quality [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2454.88s)]
*  of the way we make the bags. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2459.96s)]
*  So if a craftsperson is not at the level, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2462.08s)]
*  his or her bag will not go into the store. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2465.72s)]
*  Even if they've invested that 20 or 30 hours making it? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2469.44s)]
*  Yeah, I understand. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2472.52s)]
*  And there's no way of speeding it up [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2473.92s)]
*  and keeping the quality? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2475.32s)]
*  Well, speed is the structuring value of the 20th century. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2476.16s)]
*  We went from horse carriages to the internet. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2481.16s)]
*  Are we going to be so obsessed with speed [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2485.3199999999997s)]
*  and immediate satisfaction? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2488.8799999999997s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2492.52s)]
*  Maybe there is another form of relation to the world [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2493.64s)]
*  which is linked to patience, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2498.2799999999997s)]
*  to taking the time of making things right. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2500.7999999999997s)]
*  You cannot compress time at one point [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2504.8799999999997s)]
*  without compromising on quality. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2507.64s)]
*  How Hermes creates one of a kind products [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2512.0s)]
*  from leftover materials. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2515.0s)]
*  That is 35 scarves. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2516.68s)]

*  into the mysterious brain injuries [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2535.7999999999997s)]
*  known as Havana syndrome. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2538.2s)]
*  Injuries were reported by the White House staff, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2540.3599999999997s)]
*  FBI agents, CIA and military officers and their families. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2543.72s)]
*  Last week, the House Intelligence Committee [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2549.48s)]
*  published the results of its new investigation [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2551.72s)]
*  that indicates many of the Havana syndrome cases [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2554.8799999999997s)]
*  were attacks committed by a foreign adversary. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2558.3199999999997s)]
*  That contradicts what the intelligence community [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2562.8399999999997s)]
*  led by the CIA has been saying for years. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2565.8s)]
*  The congressional report went further, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2569.28s)]
*  accusing the intelligence community [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2571.8s)]
*  of obstructing its investigation. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFGgDefy8I&t=2573.92s)]
