# Stories about Iran | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [March 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M)
*  TENTIONS [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=0.0s)]
*  Tensions keep rising between the U.S. and Iran since the Israel-Hamas war began. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=12.72s)]
*  Almost every week, Iranian-backed militias have attacked U.S. bases in Syria and Iraq. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=19.56s)]
*  It's the latest example and a serious escalation of Tehran's use of proxy fighters like Hezbollah and Hamas. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=26.96s)]
*  Tonight, you'll hear of another type of proxy that Iran deploys that receives far less attention. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=36.32s)]
*  Tehran is hiring hitmen around the world in an effort to intimidate, abduct, and assassinate [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  perceived enemies of the regime. And they're doing it right here on U.S. soil. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=50.72s)]
*  This video was posted online by a channel affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guard. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=56.72s)]
*  It vows to kill former American government officials, including President Trump, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=66.48s)]
*  to avenge the 2020 U.S. assassination of the terrorism mastermind Qasem Soleimani. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=72.0s)]
*  Threats like this have been deemed credible enough that several of these officials have been [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=79.52s)]
*  under round-the-clock protection, including former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=84.8s)]
*  former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Iran reportedly offered a hitman a million dollars [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=90.8s)]
*  to kill him, and John Bolton, the former national security adviser. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=97.52s)]
*  They bargained the price for me would be $300,000, which I have to say I found insulting. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=103.28s)]
*  So what exactly was the plot against you? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=109.04s)]
*  The Revolutionary Guard sought to procure either my kidnapping or my assassination, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  not directly by a Revolutionary Guard's member, but by seeking a hitman who would carry out the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=118.72s)]
*  job either in the U.S. or abroad. The FBI has an arrest warrant out for this Iranian officer, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  claiming that he hired the hitman online to travel to Washington, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=132.56s)]
*  corner Bolton in a garage, and kill him. But it turned out lucky for Bolton. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=138.24s)]
*  The assassin was an FBI informant. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=145.12s)]
*  This was not internet chatter. This was a negotiation to murder an American citizen, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=148.4s)]
*  a former government official. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=154.08s)]
*  Is the threat against you ongoing? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=155.76s)]
*  We've got marked secret service cars that say police, United States Secret Service outside my [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=158.56s)]
*  home. We talked to the FBI and several intelligence agencies, and they told us that Iran's efforts [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=163.84s)]
*  are becoming more frequent and bolder, and that they often go after vocal Iranian activists [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=171.52s)]
*  living abroad. The idea behind assassination plot, behind kidnapping plot is to keep you silent. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=178.96s)]
*  It's a beautiful family place. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=186.16s)]
*  We met one of their targets in Brooklyn. Masi Alinajad is a leader in the women's revolt [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=188.24s)]
*  against the law in Iran, mandating they wear a headscarf or hijab. Forced to flee 14 years ago, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=195.12s)]
*  she settled here in Brooklyn, where she encourages women back home to send her videos of them taking [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=204.64s)]
*  off the hijabs, and she spreads those images online to her 10 million or so followers, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=212.16s)]
*  fueling the protest movement. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=219.84s)]
*  So the mullahs began to focus on you. The FBI came and told you there was a plot against you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=222.24s)]
*  There were like six or seven FBI agents. When they came to my house, they told me that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=230.32s)]
*  your life is in danger. I was like, okay, tell me something new, because we Iranians are used to it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=237.52s)]
*  But they actually said, no, this time is different. They said that the Iranian regime hired [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  private investigator on US soil to take photos of your movement, your daily life, your routine. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  And I was like, wow, so they're here in New York, in Brooklyn. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=258.08s)]
*  The plot was to kidnap you and take you by speedboat to Venezuela. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=262.8s)]
*  Hey, it sounds like a scary movie to you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=270.0s)]
*  No, it sounds implausible to me. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=271.92s)]
*  You see, it's a reality for us. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=274.48s)]
*  And a reality for the FBI that says the plan was to get her to Iran to stand trial. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=277.76s)]
*  It was the same for Jamshid Sharma, another Iranian dissident who lived in Los Angeles [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  for two decades and created a website where people in Iran could report human rights abuses. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=291.04s)]
*  In 2020, while he was changing planes in Dubai on a business trip, his family noticed his phone [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  started heading in the wrong direction. His daughter, Gizelle Sharma, soon saw her dad [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=306.72s)]
*  pop up on Iranian TV in a courtroom looking petrified. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=313.44s)]
*  He's forced to confess about crimes he did not commit. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=318.88000000000005s)]
*  The charge that they gave him is corruption on earth. That's why he got the death sentence. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=321.92s)]
*  Is it a situation where he could actually be executed? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=331.44000000000005s)]
*  Any day? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  They want to hang him from a crane in the middle of the city. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=332.72s)]
*  The original plot to kidnap Masih was thwarted. But according to the FBI, a year later, in 2022, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  Iran paid this Azerbaijani, living outside New York City, $30,000 to buy a semi-automatic rifle [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=345.68s)]
*  and kill her. He lurked outside her home for a week. His plan was to take advantage of her [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  friendliness to her neighbors. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=362.48s)]
*  He was actually following my life. He knew that. I was the one offering flowers to strangers. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  You offered flowers to strangers? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=373.36s)]
*  Yeah. This is me. So he received a text message from the guy inside Iran saying that, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=375.2s)]
*  go and knock the door, then take her to the backyard garden. If I had opened the door, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=381.68s)]
*  I would have just given him a big smile and said, yes, let's go to my garden. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  And then he wanted to just kill me. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=391.92s)]
*  Did he actually knock on your door? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  Her home security camera actually caught him on her porch trying to get in. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=397.12s)]
*  Eventually, he took off but was pulled over for running a stop sign. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  That's when the police found this in his car. He's been in custody awaiting trial ever since. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=408.56s)]
*  But here's what's interesting. Neither he nor two other men the prosecutors say were hired for the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=416.24s)]
*  job were Iranian. Like him, they were Eastern European and, as is becoming a trademark of Iran [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=422.96s)]
*  shadow war, they were criminals. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=431.28s)]
*  They were all from criminal syndicate. This is what the Islamic Republic is really good at, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  like using drug dealers, using criminals to do their dirty job on the Western soil. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=440.4s)]
*  And maybe have deniability. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=448.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=449.84s)]
*  We didn't do it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  So why did they use proxies? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=452.88s)]
*  To have somebody who is not being tracked by intelligence or security agencies for this. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=454.64s)]
*  Matt Jukes, head of counterterrorism policing in Britain, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  says this is not just an American problem. In the U.K., they have foiled 15 Iranian [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=465.52s)]
*  kidnapping and assassination attempts since last year. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=472.32s)]
*  I have been involved in national security policing for over 20 years. What we've seen [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=476.64s)]
*  in the last 18 months is a real acceleration. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=481.44s)]
*  We have been told that a lot of these criminal gangs hire other criminal gangs. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=484.96s)]
*  And then maybe a third group. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=490.08s)]
*  I think we're always going to see this collaboration between criminal organizations. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  We know that this will not always be a direct line from a state organization to a threat, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=497.84s)]
*  to a potential kidnapping. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=504.4s)]
*  This recording was given to us by a foreign intelligence agency. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=506.56s)]
*  It shows how Iran recruits criminals. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=511.35999999999996s)]
*  I received a call from the IRGC, the Revolutionary Guard. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  This is an Iranian smuggler from Urmia, a town near the Turkish border. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=520.08s)]
*  He reveals to the foreign agents that he was approached by Iran's Revolutionary Guard with [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  a deal. They'll turn a blind eye to his smuggling if he helps them. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=532.24s)]
*  Their request was that I find people who could work for them. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=540.24s)]
*  What kind of work? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  Anything. Like catching someone for us so they can be beaten up or gotten rid of. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=544.64s)]
*  This surveillance video shows him recruiting a fellow smuggler for the task. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=550.8s)]
*  The man in white is Mansour Rasouli, an alleged drug dealer. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=556.56s)]
*  He agreed to arrange assassinations throughout Europe for the Iranian government for money. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=561.92s)]
*  But a few weeks later, Rasouli was kidnapped at night and interrogated in a car, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=568.48s)]
*  reportedly by Israeli intelligence. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=575.28s)]
*  They extracted this cell phone confession where Rasouli admits he was paid $150,000 upfront [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=578.8s)]
*  and promised a million dollars if he killed three people for the Iranians. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=587.84s)]
*  One is an Israeli at the embassy in Istanbul, Turkey. Another one is an American general in [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=592.88s)]
*  Germany. And one is a journalist in France. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=600.4s)]
*  The French target was identified as philosopher Bernard Henri Lévy, a vocal critic of the regime [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=605.28s)]
*  in Tehran. The identity of the American general remains a mystery. The plot to kill the three was [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=612.72s)]
*  prevented. But in recent years, Iranian dissidents were successfully kidnapped and [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=620.8s)]
*  smuggled to Iran. Several were executed. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  They've succeeded in Europe. They haven't succeeded in the United States, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=631.3599999999999s)]
*  even though we know there are targets. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=636.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=638.4s)]

*  What did that mean? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1016.64s)]

*  You just need to confess. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1090.72s)]
*  Confess to what? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1092.64s)]

*  Shargi says his interrogators threatened him with electrical shocks, waterboarding, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1103.04s)]

*  Because that's what I was. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1119.1200000000001s)]
*  You believe you were taken simply because you were American to extract a price. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1121.52s)]

*  I mean, the most mundane things. The first day they kept asking me, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1135.68s)]
*  why did you go to the White House church? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1141.04s)]

*  And then it clicked. They had hacked my Facebook. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1149.76s)]
*  They had seen the pictures of us attending my daughter's events at school at the National [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1155.2s)]
*  Cathedral. They had no idea the National Cathedral had nothing to do with the White House. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1160.72s)]
*  This is an intelligence service. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1164.8s)]
*  You would be surprised. They had my telephone. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1167.2s)]
*  So they had gone through the list of every person I'd ever met during the last 30 years [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1170.96s)]

*  These questions would go on day after day after day. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1180.32s)]
*  In December 2018, after eight months of interrogation, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1186.0s)]
*  Imad Shargi was suddenly released on bail. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1190.0s)]

*  Now my story takes a bizarre turn. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1206.56s)]
*  My file had been sent to the Revolutionary Court. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1208.88s)]
*  It's where a gentleman by the name of Judge Salavati sits, also known as the Hanging Judge. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1211.68s)]
*  In November 2020, the Hanging Judge sentenced Shargi to 10 years in prison [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1218.48s)]

*  To escape. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1236.3200000000002s)]

*  Smugglers helped him make his way to Iran's mountainous border with Kurdistan, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1239.8400000000001s)]

*  I look up and there is about 15 guys with AK-47 pointing at the car. They threw me on the ground [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1246.64s)]

*  They were looking for somebody else. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1263.2800000000002s)]
*  They were looking for somebody. But now we have round two of incarceration. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1264.5600000000002s)]
*  This Iranian propaganda photo taken in January 2021 shows him bearded and shackled, being escorted [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1271.1200000000001s)]
*  back toward 2A, where he says he underwent another eight months of interrogation. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1278.48s)]
*  The second eight months, I was interrogated close to 400 hours. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1285.2s)]
*  How do you stay sane? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1289.76s)]
*  All those times, there was never a doubt in my mind that my government would get me out. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1291.3600000000001s)]
*  That was my hope. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1298.0s)]
*  Back in Washington, Bahre and her daughters campaigned for Ahmad's release and sought help [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1299.92s)]
*  from the State Department, which reviewed Shargi's case and determined he was wrongfully detained. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1305.28s)]
*  The Biden administration had been trying to broker both the release of American detainees [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1311.3600000000001s)]
*  and the renewal of the Iran nuclear deal, which the Trump administration had pulled out of. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1316.48s)]
*  But the talk stalled. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1322.32s)]
*  In the fall of 2022, widespread protests broke out following the death of a young [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1325.04s)]
*  woman in the custody of Iran's morality police. In Evin prison, the inmates rioted and set fires. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1330.24s)]
*  The guards responded with tear gas and bullets. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1338.08s)]
*  It was happening a couple of yards from where I was sitting in my room. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1341.2s)]
*  Now, if I left, I could be shot. If I stayed, I could suffocate. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1345.28s)]
*  With no good option, he stayed in his cell. Shargi says he was rescued, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1353.2s)]
*  ironically, by his tormentors, a team of revolutionary guards. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1358.6399999999999s)]
*  They were pale white when they saw me. They were like, Ahmad, let's get the hell out of here. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1363.36s)]
*  Because you're worth more alive than you are dead. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1369.12s)]
*  Correct. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1372.32s)]
*  Shortly after the fire, Ahmad's sister Netta sought a meeting with Iran's top diplomat at [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1373.04s)]
*  the United Nations, Amir Said Irvani. She wanted to learn what was holding up a prisoner deal. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1378.32s)]
*  He acknowledged to you that there are people inside his own government that didn't want the [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1385.52s)]
*  deal to happen. Yeah, I mean, he acknowledged that. And just as there are people in our government [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1390.24s)]
*  who didn't want this to happen, you know, we're dealing with innocent human lives and we want to [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1395.52s)]
*  rectify the situation. But for other people, it's politics and it's power and they get in the way. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1401.36s)]
*  Arranging a meeting with President Biden proved more difficult for Netta. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1407.6s)]
*  Determined to help her brother, she went to this crowded White House reception for the Persian New [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1412.1599999999999s)]
*  Year and managed to buttonhole the president after he spoke. I told him they are American [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1417.1999999999998s)]
*  citizens who are innocent and need to come home as soon as possible because time is not on our side. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1422.7199999999998s)]
*  After roughly two years of start and stop negotiations, the U.S. and Iran reached a [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1428.64s)]
*  complex agreement. Six billion dollars that Iran had earned from selling its oil had been tied up [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1434.32s)]
*  in a foreign account for years due to U.S. sanctions. According to U.S. officials, Iran [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1440.24s)]
*  can use the money to buy humanitarian goods like food and medicine once the U.S. approves the [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1446.16s)]
*  transactions. The money goes to the suppliers, not the government of Iran. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1451.6s)]
*  On September 18th, President Biden granted clemency to five Iranians accused of nonviolent crimes. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1458.32s)]
*  Five Americans, including Ahmad Shargi, were released and flown to Qatar. From there, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1465.6s)]
*  they flew to a military base in Virginia where their families were waiting. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1472.24s)]
*  We are home. I hadn't seen my daughters for five and a half, six years. I had missed [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1476.16s)]
*  older graduations, birthdays, anniversaries with my wife. It's like being born again. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1483.76s)]
*  We had thought we were going to be freed so many times and this was it. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1492.16s)]
*  Since his release, Ahmad's making up for lost time with his family. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1496.72s)]
*  He's also had time to reflect. You think to yourself, what was this all about? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1500.8s)]
*  Why did they do this to me and to my family? For five years. And the short answer is hostage [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1507.6s)]
*  taking as statecraft. If you are an American, yes, an Iranian American, no, Iranian American, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1514.56s)]
*  Italian American, American, do not go to Iran. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1522.4s)]
*  Less than three weeks after Shargi's release, Hamas, which is financially backed by Iran, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1531.2800000000002s)]
*  attacked Israel. As Israel counterattacked in Gaza, some U.S. lawmakers have called for blocking [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1536.88s)]
*  Iran's access to the six billion. The White House insists no money has been released so far, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1543.52s)]
*  and sources told us the arrangement has not changed. When you watch the news right now and [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1549.36s)]
*  you see what has happened in Israel, not just about the people killed, but the hostages that [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1554.6399999999999s)]
*  have been taken. What is that like for you? I cannot imagine what it must feel like to have [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1559.4399999999998s)]
*  your daughter, your son, your wife, your father being taken hostage. And I cannot believe what [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1566.56s)]
*  their families are going through. I just wish them a safe return home. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1574.64s)]
*  The United States first placed financial sanctions on Iran back in 1979 during the [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1589.2s)]
*  hostage crisis. For nearly four decades, the U.S. State Department has designated Iran [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1595.1200000000001s)]
*  one of the world's leading state sponsors of terrorism. But the Obama administration, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1601.2s)]
*  along with five other countries, agreed to billions of dollars in sanctions relief [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1606.88s)]
*  in exchange for Iran's agreement to dismantle much of its nuclear program and open its facilities [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1612.24s)]
*  to extensive international inspection. The Trump administration, distrusting Tehran, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1618.56s)]
*  pulled out of the deal and stepped up crushing economic pressure. That's where Ibrahim Raisi [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1625.04s)]
*  found himself when he was elected president a year ago. Last month, Iran and the 61-year-old [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1631.84s)]
*  hardliner were on the verge of striking a new deal. But then Iran submitted demands that sent [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1639.04s)]
*  the nuclear talks into a stalemate. Sir, thank you. I'm Leslie. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1645.52s)]
*  We met President Raisi Tuesday at the presidential compound in Tehran for his first interview with [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1652.96s)]
*  a Western reporter. I was told how to dress, not to sit before he did, and not to interrupt him. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1659.52s)]
*  We were given one hour for the interview. Can we start with the negotiations on the nuclear deal? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1667.8400000000001s)]
*  Do you want to have that deal renewed? Because, you know, there are some American officials who [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1674.96s)]
*  are beginning to think that you don't. If it's a good deal and fair deal, we would be serious [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1683.8400000000001s)]
*  about reaching an agreement. It needs to be lasting. There needs to be guarantees. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1690.96s)]
*  If there were a guarantee, then the Americans could not withdraw from the deal. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1698.48s)]
*  But you can pull out of the deal. I mean, just as well as we could pull out of the deal. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1703.04s)]
*  You see, the Americans broke their promises. They did it unilaterally. They said that, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1712.08s)]
*  I am out of the deal. Now making promises is becoming meaningless. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1717.36s)]
*  Are you saying that you cannot trust the Americans? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1721.36s)]
*  We cannot trust the Americans because of the behavior that we've already seen from them. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1727.52s)]
*  That is why, if there is no guarantee, there is no trust. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1732.08s)]
*  The U.S. says the West can't trust Iran, for instance, when it claims its nuclear program [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1736.3999999999999s)]
*  is purely for peaceful purposes. As far as we can tell, you don't use it for, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1742.8s)]
*  you know, things that can help your citizens like electricity. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1749.52s)]
*  You say that you want it for peaceful reasons. Like what? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1753.4399999999998s)]
*  Like in medicine, agriculture, oil, gas. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1758.24s)]
*  In terms of peaceful purposes, one available figure from the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1764.72s)]
*  the IAEA, is that only 1.8 percent of the country's electricity is generated by nuclear power. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1771.2s)]
*  There seems to be some evidence that you had been working, at least before, toward a bomb, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1779.6s)]
*  a bomb, a weapon, and that you might be doing that again. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1788.0s)]
*  We have responded to these claims several times. They are baseless. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1793.6s)]
*  The Islamic Republic of Iran has said many times that possessing nuclear weapons [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1799.6s)]
*  has no place in our doctrine. However, the U.S. intelligence community has assessed with high [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1804.32s)]
*  confidence that Iran did attempt to develop a nuclear bomb in the past. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1810.56s)]
*  And then there are the American citizens being detained in Tehran, three of whom were born in [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1816.3999999999999s)]
*  Iran. If there is a deal, would you agree to release the four Americans who are being held here? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1823.04s)]
*  Could that be part of it? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1831.2s)]
*  There are Iranian nationals also imprisoned inside the U.S. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1835.04s)]
*  These people are only in there because they simply try to circumvent sanctions. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1841.44s)]
*  And the Americans? We have told them that we can talk to them about this. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1845.6799999999998s)]
*  It can be conducted separately from the nuclear talks. It can be done between the two countries. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1849.28s)]
*  It is a humanitarian issue. This can be negotiated. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1854.08s)]
*  You're off to New York. You're going to speak at the United Nations. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1859.36s)]
*  You know, President Biden is going to be there. Are you open to a meeting with President Biden? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1863.36s)]
*  A face-to-face? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1871.04s)]
*  No, I don't think that such a meeting would happen. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1873.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't believe having a meeting or talk with him will be beneficial. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1879.52s)]
*  What do you think the difference is from your perspective between the Trump administration [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1883.84s)]
*  and the Biden administration? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1889.52s)]
*  The new administration in the U.S., they claim that they are different from the Trump administration. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1890.96s)]
*  They have said it in their messages to us. But we haven't witnessed any changes in reality. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1902.08s)]
*  His major grievance against President Biden is that he has maintained the sanctions on Iran [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1908.88s)]
*  that President Trump imposed. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1915.3600000000001s)]
*  The sanctions are very tyrannical. This is a tyranny against the people of Iran. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1918.1599999999999s)]
*  It is important to us to have the sanctions lifted. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1924.6399999999999s)]
*  The sanctions thrust Iran into a two-year recession, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1928.6399999999999s)]
*  mainly because oil exports from refineries like this one [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1932.4799999999998s)]
*  fell overnight from 2.8 million barrels a day to about 200,000. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1936.4799999999998s)]
*  Businesses have been cut off from international banking. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1942.8s)]
*  With inflation today in Iran at over 40 percent, virtually everything is more expensive. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1946.6399999999999s)]
*  And yet we found traffic here as clogged as in New York. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1953.52s)]
*  And as we saw, Tehran's bazaars are teeming with shoppers. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1961.12s)]
*  The ones we met were friendly to us. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=1967.04s)]

*  The Americans are supporting this false regime there, to take root and be established there. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2227.92s)]
*  Syed Ibrahim Raisi You know that Morocco, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2232.88s)]
*  Bahrain, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates have all recognized Israel and have relations with Israel. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2236.16s)]

*  more than two years ago. The U.S. killed General Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2275.92s)]

*  Does it mean an eye for an eye? There was this assassination, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2323.2000000000003s)]
*  now we're going to have an answer assassination. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2326.8s)]

*  President Trump Yes, they can create restrictions and problems [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2372.0s)]

*  to the only two people above him in the chain of command. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2646.48s)]
*  They bring in the secretary of defense and then a little bit later they brought in the president [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2650.32s)]
*  to this conversation. We're listening to the reports of the missiles flying. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2653.92s)]
*  Have you ever been on one like this? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2657.6s)]
*  I've never been on one like this where real missiles being fired at our forces [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2659.04s)]
*  and where I thought the risks were so high. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2663.84s)]
*  The Iranian attack on Al-Assad was in retaliation for a stunning U.S. operation [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2665.7599999999998s)]
*  President Trump ordered six nights earlier. A drone strike which killed Iran's most powerful [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2670.72s)]
*  general, Qasem Soleimani. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2676.8s)]
*  The blood of many Americans is on the hands of Qasem Soleimani. He was as close to an [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2679.2799999999997s)]
*  indispensable man as you could find inside Iran. Where he went, violence and death followed. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2683.92s)]
*  During the American occupation of Iraq, Soleimani had orchestrated attacks which killed more than [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2688.88s)]
*  600 U.S. troops. And according to McKenzie, he was planning to do it again. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2694.4s)]
*  We saw intelligence reports where Qasem Soleimani was moving various attack streams forward [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2700.2400000000002s)]
*  against our forces in Iraq, against our embassy and against other bases there. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2705.36s)]
*  Were they imminent? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2709.84s)]
*  Perhaps in hours, perhaps in days, probably not weeks. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2710.88s)]
*  Until then, the U.S. had shied away from going after Soleimani for fear killing such a high [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2714.24s)]
*  ranking government official would only provoke more Iranian attacks. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2719.4399999999996s)]
*  I never take killing anyone as an easy decision. But I think the risk of not acting in this case [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2724.3199999999997s)]
*  outweighed the risks of acting. So yes, I was good with the decision. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2730.72s)]
*  On January 3rd of last year, an airport security camera recorded Soleimani's arrival in Baghdad [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2734.56s)]
*  on a commercial flight from Damascus. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2740.7999999999997s)]
*  McKenzie was watching from a different angle. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2743.6800000000003s)]
*  You have the drones overhead. Do you see him? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2746.4s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Yes. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2749.44s)]
*  As Soleimani's entourage pulled away from the plane, McKenzie gave the kill order to the commander [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2751.76s)]
*  controlling the drones. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2757.52s)]
*  And then I said, take your shot when you got it. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2759.04s)]
*  Missiles slammed into both vehicles simultaneously. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2761.6s)]
*  There's no back slapping, there's no cheering, because now I have to prepare to deal with the [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2765.04s)]
*  consequences of the action. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2768.32s)]
*  General McKenzie was sure Iran would retaliate, but he didn't know how. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2769.84s)]
*  And neither for a while did the Iranians. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2774.6400000000003s)]
*  I believe they went into a period of disorganization because they had lost the officer [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2777.28s)]
*  who really spoke up and shaped everything up and told them what they were going to do. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2782.0s)]
*  So it was kind of an ominous silence. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2786.0s)]
*  It was a very ominous silence. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2789.6800000000003s)]
*  And what was the first sign that Iran might really be thinking of a ballistic missile attack? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2791.44s)]
*  They began to move their ballistic missiles. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2797.84s)]
*  The attack was just hours away when Major Allen Johnson got the word Iran's most powerful weapons [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2800.0s)]
*  were aiming for Al-Assad. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2806.2400000000002s)]
*  My intelligence officer pulled me aside and basically said, sir, I've got some bad news for you. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2808.48s)]
*  What's up? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2816.56s)]
*  We have information that Iran is fueling 27 medium-range ballistic missiles, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2818.88s)]
*  and their intention is to level this base. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2825.2000000000003s)]
*  And we may not survive. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2827.52s)]
*  This was a completely different threat. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2829.7599999999998s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Tim Garland commanded an Army battalion at Al-Assad, a sprawling air base about [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2832.4s)]
*  120 miles west of Baghdad, where the U.S. operated scores of helicopters, drones, and other aircraft. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2838.56s)]
*  Did the base have any defense against ballistic missiles? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2846.7999999999997s)]
*  No, sir. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2849.92s)]
*  It was such an unprecedented threat. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2850.48s)]
*  I don't think it was ever calculated. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2852.4s)]
*  So the capability to prevent a ballistic missile attack, it wasn't there. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2854.64s)]
*  Did you have a plan for what to do? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2862.72s)]
*  We came up with a plan. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2866.9599999999996s)]
*  The only real defense against a ballistic missile attack is to get out of harm's way. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2868.3199999999997s)]
*  Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Stacy Coleman and the rest of Al-Assad [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2873.8399999999997s)]
*  scrambled to evacuate more than 50 aircraft and 1,000 troops before the missiles hit. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2877.52s)]
*  The base still had to be manned. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2884.24s)]
*  We still needed to be able to do our mission. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2886.4799999999996s)]
*  The first decision was to split our team by combat capability. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2889.3599999999997s)]
*  What did you think was going to happen to the people you were telling to stay? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2893.2799999999997s)]
*  The honest truth is I didn't think that we were going to survive. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2898.8799999999997s)]
*  The best shelter was air raid bunkers built during the rule of Saddam Hussein, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2904.0s)]
*  but there weren't enough of them. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2908.64s)]
*  And I just remember a very heavy sinking feeling setting in. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2910.8s)]
*  It was like, man, we are not going to come up with a bunker plan that's going to be adequate [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2915.52s)]
*  for the number of people that we're talking about. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2920.56s)]
*  So Garland sent most of his soldiers out into the desert [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2924.0s)]
*  where they watched the attack from a safe distance. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2927.04s)]
*  Holy ****. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2930.32s)]
*  There was a lot of people who didn't want to leave. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2931.76s)]
*  They didn't want to be that guy that was going to relative safety. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2934.8s)]
*  A lot of people might have trouble understanding what you just said. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2937.28s)]
*  Tell me why a soldier wouldn't want to go to a safe place. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2941.28s)]
*  They want to carry the burden. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2946.4s)]
*  They want to share in the danger. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2947.44s)]
*  From his headquarters in Tampa, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2949.44s)]
*  General Frank McKenzie had tried to time the evacuation just right. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2951.36s)]
*  If you go too early, you risk the problem that the enemy will see what you have done [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2956.1600000000003s)]
*  and adjust his plans. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2961.28s)]
*  The Iranians monitored Al-Assad by purchasing photos like these taken by commercial satellites. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2962.64s)]
*  McKenzie waited until after Iran had downloaded its last picture for the day. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2968.72s)]
*  So the last time the Iranians took a look with their commercially acquired spy photos, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2974.56s)]
*  what would they have seen? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2982.48s)]
*  They would have seen airplanes on the ground and people working. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2983.6s)]
*  So when they launched those missiles, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2986.08s)]
*  they thought that was going to be a full flight line. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2989.12s)]
*  I think they expected to destroy a number of U.S. aircraft [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2992.64s)]
*  and to kill a number of U.S. service members. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2995.52s)]
*  A clock stopped at 1 34 a.m. when it was knocked off the wall, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=2998.4s)]
*  recorded the moment the first missile landed. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3002.72s)]
*  It's like the sun rising instantaneous. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3006.0s)]
*  That's how bright it was. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3008.3199999999997s)]
*  Air Force Master Sergeant John Haynes and his security team were outside [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3009.7599999999998s)]
*  their armored patrol vehicle when the first missile struck. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3013.6s)]
*  Across the radio, we heard incoming, incoming, incoming. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3017.04s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3019.7599999999998s)]
*  I just threw the phone down and ran to my vehicle. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3020.8s)]
*  And then once that impact happened, the back pressure blew our doors closed. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3023.52s)]
*  And then you just see a cloud of dirt, fire. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3026.7200000000003s)]
*  They call it a shockwave. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3028.96s)]
*  And you kind of feel that wave almost internally. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3031.44s)]
*  Like you it's almost as if your organs are, you know, kind of wavering around inside. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3034.88s)]
*  Sergeant Kimo Kelts was outside the bunkers manning a guard post [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3040.88s)]
*  in case the missile barrage was followed by a ground assault. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3044.8s)]
*  We got down and we protected our vital organs, our heads, and we waited. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3048.4s)]
*  Did it blow you around? [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3054.0s)]
*  One of the closest ones that had hit directly near us [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3056.4s)]
*  had actually lifted my body about two inches off the ground. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3063.2000000000003s)]
*  Iran fired a total of 16 missiles from three locations. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3068.16s)]
*  Five missed. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3072.7200000000003s)]
*  Eleven landed at Al-Asad. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3074.0s)]
*  This was an attack like no other. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3076.3199999999997s)]
*  It was an attack certainly like nothing I've ever seen or experienced. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3078.72s)]
*  What have you learned so far? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3081.8399999999997s)]
*  Their missiles are accurate. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3083.2799999999997s)]
*  Did that surprise you? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3084.72s)]
*  We knew it, but to see it, they fired those missiles to significant range [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3086.0s)]
*  and they hit pretty much where they wanted to hit. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3089.7599999999998s)]
*  From first launch to last impact was 80 minutes. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3092.08s)]
*  Somehow no one was killed. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3095.68s)]
*  When the sun came up, the survivors surveyed the damage. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3098.0s)]
*  Holy s**t. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3103.04s)]
*  Shells of a building, you know, skeletal frames left with nothing else. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3106.24s)]
*  Craters about a room size deep into the ground. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3111.68s)]
*  Concrete barriers blown across a field or a street. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3115.6s)]
*  It looked like a scene from a movie where everything is destroyed around you, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3120.56s)]
*  but yet no one was killed. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3124.56s)]
*  I still have no idea or understanding other than, you know, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3126.08s)]
*  God being on our side that no one was seriously injured and there were no, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3133.12s)]
*  you know, no fatalities. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3138.8s)]
*  The news traveled fast up the chain of command and President Trump tweeted all as well. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3142.64s)]
*  That turned out to be premature. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3148.48s)]
*  There are people throwing up. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3150.7200000000003s)]
*  Everybody had headaches. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3152.64s)]
*  I had a concussion for two weeks. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3154.32s)]
*  What did it feel like? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3156.56s)]
*  Someone hitting me over the head with a hammer over and over and over. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3158.2400000000002s)]
*  Finally, you know, hours later, we realized we have a mass casualty event here of traumatic brain injury. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3162.0s)]
*  Military doctors diagnosed more than 100 cases of traumatic brain injury. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3170.24s)]
*  Major Alan Johnson and 28 other soldiers received purple hearts. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3175.28s)]
*  Do you have any lingering effects today? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3179.84s)]
*  Headaches every day, horrible tinnitus ringing in the ears, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3182.96s)]
*  PTSD. I'll be willing to admit that. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3187.04s)]
*  I still have nightmares. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3193.7599999999998s)]
*  But the nightmare of war with Iran had been averted. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3196.16s)]
*  Had Americans been killed, it would have been very different. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3200.4s)]
*  Have you ever done an estimate on if you hadn't evacuated the damage that would have been done? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3203.2s)]
*  So I think we might have lost 20 or 30 airplanes and we might have lost 100 to 150 U.S. personnel. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3209.44s)]
*  You had a plan to retaliate if they killed Americans. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3215.6s)]
*  David, we had a plan to retaliate if Americans had died. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3221.36s)]
*  Iran was on alert for a possible U.S. strike and hours later shot down a Ukrainian airliner [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3225.8399999999997s)]
*  thinking it was an American bomber. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3232.24s)]
*  176 entirely innocent people died. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqAHUZ6i9M&t=3234.64s)]
