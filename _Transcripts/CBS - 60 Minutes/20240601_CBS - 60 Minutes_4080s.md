**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [June 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E)
*  The president says he wants to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba early next year, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=0.0s)]
*  it's an open question where those prisoners would go. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=18.44s)]
*  One possibility is a secretive installation in Colorado where more than 40 terrorists [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=22.16s)]
*  are already locked away. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=27.36s)]
*  The government doesn't say much about this place, called the United States Penitentiary [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=29.16s)]
*  Administrative Maximum, also known as SuperMax. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=33.74s)]
*  The public had never seen the operation inside until we broadcast this story in 2007. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=38.24s)]
*  Since President Obama mentioned SuperMax in a speech about Guantanamo, we wanted to take [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=44.92s)]
*  you there again. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=49.74s)]
*  It's a sort of 21st century Alcatraz, where convicted Al-Qaeda terrorists are force-fed, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  and some guards worry about their own safety. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=57.76s)]
*  SuperMax is the place America sends the prisoners it wants to punish the most, a place former [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=61.0s)]
*  warden Robert Hood described as a clean version of hell. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=67.28s)]
*  I don't know what hell is, but I do know that the assumption would be for a free person, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=71.64s)]
*  would be pretty close to it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  This is as close to it as we could get with our cameras. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  The ADX lies low and sprawling by the foothills of the Rockies, 100 miles south of Denver. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=84.16s)]
*  There have been six wardens since it opened in 1994, but this is the first time one of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  them has described his experiences inside. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=95.72s)]
*  Robert Hood ran the place from 2002 to 2005, at the end of 20 years in the Bureau of Prisons. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=99.0s)]
*  When the SuperMax job came up, you were excited about taking it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=106.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, in our system, there's 114 prisons, and there's only one SuperMax. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=111.72000000000001s)]
*  It's like the Harvard of the system. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=117.44000000000001s)]
*  Except the ivory towers of Harvard may be easier to get into. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=119.76s)]
*  SuperMax holds fewer than 500 prisoners. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=123.76s)]
*  Most are here because they're too violent to be anywhere else. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  But this is also where America keeps convicted terrorists, more than 40 of them. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=130.96s)]
*  You think the guard towers are watching us? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=136.52s)]
*  I know they're watching. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=138.52s)]
*  But the Bureau of Prisons doesn't want us watching them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=140.0s)]
*  The general public has never seen SuperMax in operation, but we found these rare, if [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=143.52s)]
*  poor quality, pictures in the files of a court case. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=149.76s)]
*  The video shot by the staff shows a new inmate, Lawrence Klacker, a member of a prison gang, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=153.68s)]
*  being brought in through the underground garage. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=159.68s)]
*  Most prisoners spend up to 23 hours a day in their cells, every minute, every meal. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=162.8s)]
*  The window in their cell is blocked so they can't see the mountains. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=169.4s)]
*  The inmates can watch a 12-inch black and white television or read books to pass the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=173.6s)]
*  time, and if they behave, they may get limited exercise in a one-man recreation pen. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=178.52s)]
*  This was the life that terrorist Richard Reed saw when he was brought into SuperMax. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=186.08s)]
*  Tell me about when he came in. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=191.8s)]
*  We're escorting him down, and his eyes are getting bigger and bigger. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=193.08s)]
*  He's realizing I'm in trouble. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=195.88s)]
*  Shortly after 9-11, it was Reed who tried to blow up an airliner with a bomb in his shoe. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=197.96s)]
*  Reed didn't impress you? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=206.12s)]
*  A leader or a follower? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=207.12s)]
*  Definitely, in my opinion, a follower. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  I think he would jump off the top of the Empire State Building if you thought it was for the right cause. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=211.8s)]
*  We've learned that Reed, seen here in his cell, is in a special wing for terrorists [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=217.32s)]
*  called H Unit. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=222.4s)]
*  Others include Zacarius Massawi, who wanted to be one of the 9-11 hijackers, and Wadiyel [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=224.2s)]
*  Hajj, Osama bin Laden's former private secretary. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=229.44s)]
*  Another terrorist in SuperMax is Ramsey Youssef, the leader of the first World Trade Center [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  attack in 1993. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=239.12s)]
*  What did you make of him? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=241.88s)]
*  The most interesting inmate in my career. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=243.88s)]
*  I was surprised that he was extremely respectful, prayed almost on the hour. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  Youssef has been living in ADX for 11 years, sacrificing to live by his own code. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  Something as simple as recreating. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=265.88s)]
*  He would have to strip search, be strip searched to go recreate. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=268.91999999999996s)]
*  He chose not to do that because of his belief that it would be inappropriate for us to see [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=273.24s)]
*  his body. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=278.72s)]
*  And so he stays in the cell? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=280.08s)]
*  Never been out, to my knowledge. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=281.92s)]
*  Eight years after Youssef's World Trade Center attack came 9-11, and the inmates saw it on [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=284.32s)]
*  the TVs in their cells. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=290.16s)]
*  We had a lot of them jump up and down, you know, screaming, yell, and clap, and they [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  were very excited. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=300.0s)]
*  Barbara Batoulas is a corrections officer speaking to us as head of the officers union. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=302.72s)]
*  She is the only current SuperMax employee who would sit down for an interview. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=308.36s)]
*  I'm curious about the Islamist extremists, the terrorists in the prison as a group. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=313.52s)]
*  What are they like? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=320.0s)]
*  How do they behave? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=321.56s)]
*  A lot of them behave self-righteously. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=324.64s)]
*  They're very needy, but me being a female, I think that's part of me dealing with them also. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=330.32s)]
*  You said they're needy? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=336.08s)]
*  Some of them are. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=338.4s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=339.4s)]
*  They want more than what they have coming. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=340.4s)]
*  Like what? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=342.32s)]
*  Just your basics. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=343.32s)]
*  They want extra toilet paper or extra paper, writing paper, extra envelopes. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=344.32s)]
*  If you can't give them, they want to see a supervisor right then and there, and that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=350.4s)]
*  doesn't always happen. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=355.44s)]
*  There have been concessions to the Islamic terrorists. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  We got a hold of the commissary list and we found prayer rugs for $18 and a menu with [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=359.72s)]
*  no pork. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=365.20000000000005s)]
*  But still, they're ordered around by female guards and that really upsets them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  A terrorist inmate threatened to kill my family because I was doing my job. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=373.36s)]
*  I wonder, do the corrections officers prefer to work elsewhere in the prison? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  Do they prefer to work with the gang bangers and the murderers? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=383.56s)]
*  I do. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=386.76000000000005s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=387.76000000000005s)]
*  Because I am a female. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=389.56s)]
*  You can feel it? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  Oh yes. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=392.03999999999996s)]
*  Yes, it's very obvious. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, they just look at you with sheer disdain. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=394.03999999999996s)]
*  Turns out that sheer disdain doesn't end there. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=397.8s)]
*  We're told that there have been frequent hunger strikes among the Islamic terrorist [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=401.28s)]
*  inmates inside Supermax and to keep the inmates alive, there are often force feedings. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=405.36s)]
*  That's when an inmate is restrained and liquid nourishment is poured down a tube in his nose. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=411.56s)]
*  We're told that there have been a dozen hunger strikers and one of them used to be Osama [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=417.08s)]
*  bin Laden's secretary. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=421.76s)]
*  Former warden Robert Hood told us that he supervised many of these feedings. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=423.96s)]
*  I probably conducted, authorized, conducted 350, maybe 400 of involuntary feedings. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=428.44s)]
*  350 or 400? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=436.64s)]
*  Not individuals because you can have one person, three meals a day for two months. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=439.36s)]
*  The Bureau of Prisons records that we have seen show that there have been as many as [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=446.64s)]
*  900 of what the Bureau calls involuntary feedings of terrorists in each unit since 2001. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  Why did they stop eating? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=459.2s)]
*  What was the complaint? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=460.2s)]
*  It was conditions of confinement. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=461.47999999999996s)]
*  Some of the conditions that they object to are outlined in this document. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=464.0s)]
*  Inmates get letters only from people approved by the prison and they get one monitored phone [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=468.52s)]
*  call a month for 15 minutes. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=474.6s)]
*  As strict as that seems, we're told that there is an even higher level of confinement, sort [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=477.48s)]
*  of an ultramax inside supermax. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=482.38s)]
*  It's a group of cells where there is virtually no human contact, not even with the guards, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=485.92s)]
*  and there are only two prisoners who are considered so dangerous that they're locked in this place [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=491.64s)]
*  that's known as Range 13. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=497.32s)]
*  One of them is Tommy Silverstein who killed a prison guard and the other is World Trade [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=501.12s)]
*  Center bomber Ramsey Youssef. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=507.04s)]
*  Warden Hood says Youssef is on Range 13 for just one reason. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=509.4s)]
*  He has that Charlie Manson look. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=514.48s)]
*  Charlie Manson look? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=515.92s)]
*  He just has the eyes, he has some charisma about him. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=518.04s)]
*  He's in uniform but you know that there's a powerful person that you're looking at. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=523.64s)]
*  You didn't want him in a place where he could give anybody any orders. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=528.16s)]
*  True. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=531.88s)]
*  We're told something strange is happening with Youssef. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=533.0s)]
*  He now insists that he has renounced Islam and converted to Christianity. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=535.6s)]
*  He's even begun leaving his cell for exercise. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=541.88s)]
*  Warden Hood left before all this happened but still, he doesn't buy it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=545.04s)]
*  He's playing a game with someone. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=550.52s)]
*  If he's doing that, he's doing it for the reaction, he's doing it for whatever. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=552.92s)]
*  He is the real deal. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=555.52s)]
*  There are plenty of other real deals at super max. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=557.16s)]
*  They're the all stars of infamy. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=559.9599999999999s)]
*  There's Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, Oklahoma City Bombers Terry Nichols and Tim McVeigh [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=562.4s)]
*  before McVeigh was executed and Robert Hanson, the FBI supervisor turned Soviet spy. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=567.64s)]
*  Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph is here. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=574.48s)]
*  So are the Al Qaeda terrorists who bombed the U.S. embassies in Africa. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=577.28s)]
*  Mob informant Sammy the Bull Gravano has been here. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=581.6s)]
*  We weren't allowed any interviews with prisoners in super max but we did find Garrett Linderman, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=585.24s)]
*  an inmate who actually got out. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=591.4s)]
*  You were one of the least famous people in the whole place. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=594.34s)]
*  In the whole prison. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=596.96s)]
*  Linderman had been in another prison for robbery until his cellmate there was found stabbed [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=599.02s)]
*  to death. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=604.04s)]
*  Linderman wasn't tried for the murder but they transferred him to the ADX or super max. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=605.5s)]
*  He was released, then robbed a bank and we found him here in Washington state. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=610.78s)]
*  How is the ADX different than other lockups you've been in? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=617.42s)]
*  Your connections to the outside, your family, through phone calls, visits, all those are [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=621.78s)]
*  pretty much stopped at the ADX. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=630.26s)]
*  There's no comparison. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=632.9399999999999s)]
*  You talked about the brutality of isolation. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=635.6s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=641.14s)]
*  It breaks down the human spirit. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=642.14s)]
*  It breaks down the human psyche. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=643.6600000000001s)]
*  It breaks your mind. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=650.26s)]
*  What does the world look like to a super max inmate? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=652.1s)]
*  With his own pictures, Linderman gave us a tour of his former 7 by 12 foot cell. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=655.6s)]
*  This is the shower, the concrete bed, her mattress. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=661.38s)]
*  This is the window with the red concrete bricks behind it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=669.1s)]
*  It's the only prison I've ever heard of that allows you to take a picture in your cell. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=674.14s)]
*  I guess they're quite confident in their security. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=680.82s)]
*  Confident, but there has been trouble like this. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=685.22s)]
*  Until 2005, some general population inmates were allowed in the rec yard together and [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=689.08s)]
*  there were occasional fights. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=694.58s)]
*  In the 14 years since it's been open, two inmates have been murdered. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=696.74s)]
*  And remember Clacker, the inmate you saw being brought into the super max? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=701.22s)]
*  He later killed himself, one of four prisoners who've committed suicide. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=705.16s)]
*  There remains another concern for safety today. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=710.42s)]
*  Barbara Batoulas, who is the head of the officers union, told us that the prison is dangerously [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=714.02s)]
*  understaffed with more than a quarter of the staff jobs unfilled. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=718.94s)]
*  He'd been told that entire housing units that house notorious gang members and terrorists [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=724.66s)]
*  have gone uncovered and have been monitored by officers elsewhere in the prison during [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=732.2199999999999s)]
*  these staff shortages. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=739.1s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=740.1s)]
*  I can't really say anything about that. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=741.1s)]
*  That's internal security and I can't talk about that. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=744.62s)]
*  I can tell you that we are very short staffed. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=750.22s)]
*  What's at stake? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=755.6999999999999s)]
*  Lives. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=757.5s)]
*  I firmly believe staff lives are at stake. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=758.66s)]
*  It's not just her opinion. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=761.74s)]
*  In 2006, a federal arbitration judge agreed that the prison was short staffed and said [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=763.3s)]
*  that assaults and threats from inmates were increasing. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=768.6999999999999s)]
*  The current super max warden met with us briefly and told us the staffing shortage is overblown [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=772.38s)]
*  by the union, but he wouldn't appear on camera. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=778.14s)]
*  In fact, no one at the federal bureau of prisons would sit down for an interview. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=781.14s)]
*  Supermax remains the least known prison in America. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=787.02s)]
*  I've heard the ADX described as a clean version of hell. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=791.42s)]
*  The perfection of isolation painted pretty. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=795.06s)]
*  The perfection of isolation, is that the way it felt to you? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=798.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they've perfected it there. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=801.9s)]
*  There has been a lot of talk about criminal justice reform in America and it would be [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=808.06s)]
*  hard to find a place more in need of reform than Rikers Island, the most important jail [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=817.7399999999999s)]
*  in New York City. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=823.2199999999999s)]
*  Located in the middle of the East River, Rikers holds about 10,000 inmates. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=825.38s)]
*  It's a volatile mix. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=829.9s)]
*  Some have been convicted of minor crimes, but as many as 80% are awaiting trial. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=831.88s)]
*  Many are there because they can't make bail. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=837.86s)]
*  And in a trend that reflects a growing national problem, Rikers holds a rising number of mentally [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=840.46s)]
*  ill inmates. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=846.14s)]
*  The mentally ill now make up more than 40% of the population. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=847.82s)]
*  Correction officers are not adequately trained to deal with this population. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=852.66s)]
*  The result is a disturbing pattern of neglect and excessive force that is the focus of our [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=856.54s)]
*  story tonight. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=861.98s)]
*  It has led the U.S. attorney, Preet Bharara, to intervene. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=863.62s)]
*  What you really had, we found, was a culture of violence on top of a code of silence. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=868.86s)]
*  And that is a deadly combination. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=876.0600000000001s)]
*  And I mean that literally, as we found in a number of cases that we have brought in [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=878.5600000000001s)]
*  connection with Rikers Island. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=883.94s)]
*  Concerned by those deaths and a stream of alarming reports about Rikers Island, Preet [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=885.9s)]
*  Bharara, who is the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, launched a [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=890.52s)]
*  two-year investigation into the jail complex. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=894.7s)]
*  We found in an alarming number of cases there was no discipline with respect to officers [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=897.78s)]
*  at all. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=902.5s)]
*  You had an officer who had dozens of complaints against him and was never disciplined once, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=903.5s)]
*  or maybe just one time. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=907.98s)]
*  And that's something that has to change. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=909.62s)]
*  People have to understand that there are consequences for their actions, not just the inmates, but [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=910.96s)]
*  the officers as well. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=915.54s)]
*  How long has this been going on? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=917.06s)]
*  Years and years. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=919.14s)]
*  Too long. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=920.14s)]
*  Rikers is a 400-acre island just off the tarmac of LaGuardia Airport in the shadows of Manhattan [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=921.14s)]
*  skyscrapers. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=927.62s)]
*  One bridge leads in and out. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=929.06s)]
*  It's surrounded by its own moat. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=931.66s)]
*  The inmate population has come down dramatically, from a high of 20,000 to 10,000. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=934.26s)]
*  But despite the decrease, city data shows violence has gone up over the last decade. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=940.48s)]
*  Because of the U.S. attorney's findings, an unusual collaboration was formed. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=947.42s)]
*  Berara, the prosecutor, teamed up with plaintiff's lawyers, the Legal Aid Society, and private [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=951.54s)]
*  attorney Jonathan Abadie in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of a dozen Rikers inmates. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=956.9399999999999s)]
*  The number of facial fractures, of traumatic brain injury, of broken bones, of serious [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=962.42s)]
*  physical injury is just out of control. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=968.98s)]
*  Compounding the problems at Rikers is that increase in the number of mentally ill inmates. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=972.66s)]
*  And that just complicates issues relating to violence and issues relating to care and [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=978.9s)]
*  issues relating to discipline. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=982.66s)]
*  So it's a problem. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=985.3399999999999s)]
*  What was captured on this video, obtained by 60 Minutes, helps illustrate what U.S. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=986.3399999999999s)]
*  Attorney Berara is talking about. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=990.86s)]

*  Bradley Ballard, who was schizophrenic and diabetic, was brought to Rikers in 2013 on [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=995.98s)]
*  charges of violating parole for an assault conviction. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1002.0s)]

*  gestures and then was taken back to his cell according to an investigation by the New York [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1011.84s)]
*  State Commission of Correction. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1017.44s)]
*  He was placed in the functional equivalent of solitary confinement. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1019.48s)]

*  At the end of the day, shouldn't the question be, why didn't these individuals receive their [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1537.7s)]
*  medication so they wouldn't attack a correctional officer? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1542.6200000000001s)]
*  If you're talking about an inmate that has a mental health problem, then certainly something [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1545.42s)]
*  set this person off. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1549.48s)]
*  Seabrook says it's not just an issue of the mentally ill. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1551.42s)]
*  Rikers is a dangerous place and many of his officers are assaulted every year. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1554.78s)]
*  Seabrook wanted to show us the conditions his officers have to contend with. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1560.74s)]
*  But when he took us out to Rikers, Department of Corrections staffers stopped us from going [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1564.98s)]
*  inside with our cameras to see the problem Seabrook is talking about. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1569.66s)]
*  This is as far as we got, walking around the perimeter of one of the buildings with him. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1574.18s)]
*  We wanted to talk to the Commissioner of the Correction Department about the problems at [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1579.68s)]
*  But our three scheduled interviews all were postponed. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1584.3s)]
*  The city recently initiated a number of policy changes, like installing more cameras and [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1588.4599999999998s)]
*  reducing the use of solitary confinement. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1594.1s)]
*  A federal monitor was appointed to ensure the reforms are implemented. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1596.98s)]
*  U.S. Attorney Barrara is going to hold the city to it. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1601.1399999999999s)]
*  Is there a decrease in violence? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1605.1s)]
*  You know, it remains to be seen how much that decrease will be over time. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1607.1399999999999s)]
*  I think the training will take some time and is happening as we speak. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1610.3799999999999s)]
*  It's taken some time to build up this culture of violence. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1613.58s)]
*  Yes, it has. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1616.94s)]
*  How long do you think it will take to unravel it? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1617.94s)]
*  I'm not going to put a clock on it, but I will say that we're impatient people and we [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1620.74s)]
*  like to see results. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1625.1399999999999s)]
*  That's why we got involved in the first place. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1626.1399999999999s)]
*  The United States' federal prison system has 157,000 inmates in its custody. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1640.3s)]
*  It locks up some of the most dangerous and high-profile criminals in the world. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1653.1s)]
*  Serial killers and terrorists are among those inside its 122 prisons, which include supermax [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1658.1399999999999s)]
*  penitentiaries and minimum security camps. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1664.26s)]
*  The cost to American taxpayers is more than $8 billion a year. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1667.62s)]
*  Tonight, we will take you inside the Federal Bureau of Prisons, an agency in crisis. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1672.06s)]
*  A series of government investigations has found the Bureau's workforce is dangerously [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1677.86s)]
*  understaffed and inside its women's prisons, there is an alarming pattern of abuse. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1682.26s)]
*  Collette Peters is in charge of fixing the Bureau of Prisons. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1688.1399999999999s)]
*  She's the sixth director in six years. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1691.4199999999998s)]
*  This is Aliceville, a low-security women's prison in rural Alabama where more than 1,400 [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1694.42s)]
*  inmates are serving time. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1704.5800000000002s)]
*  People drive past prisons every day. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1706.5800000000002s)]
*  They're terrified of them. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1708.98s)]
*  Or they don't think about them at all. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1710.5s)]
*  It's kind of like this forgotten zone. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1712.5800000000002s)]
*  I don't want people to forget about this place. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1714.78s)]
*  Collette Peters became director of the Bureau of Prisons in August 2022. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1716.6200000000001s)]
*  After a 20-year career in corrections, she's built a reputation as a reformer. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1721.78s)]
*  I love your poster. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1726.62s)]
*  We are all stronger than we think, aren't we? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1727.84s)]
*  Before becoming director, she was credited with shaping Oregon's state prison system [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1730.06s)]
*  by prioritizing staff mental health support and advocating for the compassionate treatment [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1734.66s)]
*  of inmates. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1739.52s)]
*  I have this very early memory in kindergarten where an individual came in with a pocket [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1740.6s)]
*  knife and was marched to the principal's office. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1746.78s)]
*  And I just remember in that moment saying, I want to help him. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1750.62s)]
*  Many people in your custody are there because of horrific crimes. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1753.5s)]
*  Why do they deserve compassion? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1758.9399999999998s)]
*  Because 95% of them are going to come back to our communities someday. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1761.4599999999998s)]
*  And I want them to be productive, taxpaying citizens who no longer commit crimes. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1765.02s)]
*  But the Bureau of Prisons is so inadequately staffed, it is struggling to fulfill its mission, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1772.1s)]
*  rehabilitating inmates and keeping its prisons safe. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1777.7s)]
*  Government watchdogs have documented disrepair in all of its institutions, requiring more [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1782.5s)]
*  than $2 billion in fixes. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1787.46s)]
*  And employees rank the Bureau of Prisons the worst place to work in the federal government. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1790.3600000000001s)]
*  It's very rare for the media to be allowed inside a federal prison. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1795.78s)]
*  Why are we here? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1799.66s)]
*  I truly believe in transparency. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1800.9s)]
*  Are we perfect? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1802.9s)]
*  No. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1803.9s)]
*  Do we have issues we need to resolve? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1804.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1805.9s)]
*  But I want people to see the good stuff. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1807.1000000000001s)]
*  We toured Aliceville with director Peters and saw where inmates live, learn new trades [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1809.66s)]
*  and work. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1815.6200000000001s)]
*  On this day, sewing sleeping bags for the military, a coveted job because it pays $1.15 an hour. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1816.7800000000002s)]
*  You ladies are amazing. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1825.0600000000002s)]
*  And when you leave here, you're going to be incredible. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1827.1000000000001s)]
*  This ceremony is for inmates graduating from a faith-based program, preparing them for [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1830.3000000000002s)]
*  life on the outside. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1834.7800000000002s)]
*  By connecting them with community leaders and teaching them life skills, like anger [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1836.82s)]
*  management. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1841.3799999999999s)]
*  But the reality is nearly half of federal inmates will end up back behind bars or arrested [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1842.3799999999999s)]
*  within three years of getting out. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1848.3s)]
*  A lot of those faces in there who have so much promise and hope today could end up right [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1850.62s)]
*  back in here. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1854.74s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think we have a lot of work to do to dial down that recidivism rate. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1855.74s)]
*  We have to send fewer people to prison for shorter periods of time. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1859.9399999999998s)]
*  And then when they're here, do things like this. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1863.82s)]
*  You also have a major staffing issue and people can't get these classes that they need. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1866.6599999999999s)]
*  Staffing was a problem before the pandemic. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1872.3s)]
*  And so that those recruitment efforts and those retention efforts have gotten hard. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1874.62s)]
*  How many correctional officers do you need on staff to get you out of this staffing crisis? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1879.02s)]
*  So we hope to have that real number for you and the public very soon. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1884.1399999999999s)]
*  That seems like a critical number. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1890.82s)]
*  How was that not on your desk when you took this job on day one? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1892.4199999999998s)]
*  And still not there a year later. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1895.98s)]
*  So the good news is this was a problem the Bureau was trying to solve before I got here [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1897.34s)]
*  and we're in the process of solving it. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1901.78s)]
*  Director Peters says she expects to have the number of officers needed by October, more [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1903.74s)]
*  than two years after taking office. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1908.5s)]
*  But Shane Fozzi, the recently retired president of the Federal Prison Employees Union, says [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1911.18s)]
*  he knows what that number is now. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1916.06s)]
*  We're short about 8,000 positions nationwide. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1918.6200000000001s)]
*  How bad is it? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1921.7s)]
*  It results in one of us losing our lives. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1922.7s)]
*  And it's that bad. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1926.38s)]
*  We can't continue with discourse. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1928.54s)]
*  By the union's count, the Bureau of Prisons is down about 40 percent of the correctional [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1930.66s)]
*  officers it needs. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1935.5s)]
*  The less supervision you have, the more bad things happen. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1937.38s)]
*  Misconduct increases, violence increases. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1940.9s)]
*  And because there are not enough officers, the Bureau relies on other prison staff to [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1944.44s)]
*  step in. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1948.74s)]
*  It's a controversial practice called augmentation. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1949.74s)]
*  Teachers, nurses, doctors, food service people, the people that maintain facilities. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1953.3s)]
*  They're doing what now? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1959.94s)]
*  They're in a housing unit supervising offenders. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1961.46s)]
*  Do they have training in that? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1964.06s)]
*  They do. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1965.58s)]
*  But I can tell you, I'm no better a plumber than they are a correctional officer. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1967.26s)]
*  I can walk into a housing unit and tell you something's right or something's wrong. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1971.54s)]
*  You develop that over years of experience. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1975.82s)]
*  Let's break this down. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1978.34s)]
*  You're talking about HVAC repairmen and accountants who are now guarding inmates. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1979.34s)]
*  That doesn't sound safe. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1987.1799999999998s)]
*  So it is. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1988.6999999999998s)]
*  So they have the exact same training as the correctional officers. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1989.6999999999998s)]
*  Now, what I will say is augmentation should only be used in the short term. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1991.98s)]
*  We've used this now to solve a long-term retention and recruitment problem. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=1997.9399999999998s)]
*  And that isn't right. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2002.74s)]
*  On this point, the union and management agree. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2004.1999999999998s)]
*  And staff, like teachers and doctors, need to be able to do their jobs so that inmates [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2007.5s)]
*  don't lose access to critical services and programs. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2012.5s)]
*  Their buzz phrase is everybody's a correctional officer first. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2016.26s)]
*  That sounds good on paper. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2019.34s)]
*  But if you take the teacher out of the classroom and nobody's teaching the offender the skills [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2020.62s)]
*  to go back out to society, we're just back to warehousing people. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2024.82s)]
*  While we walked the halls of Aliceville, classrooms were packed. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2030.18s)]
*  But several inmates told us that much of what we saw on our tour was staged. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2034.08s)]
*  Am I getting a real look at what life is like in here today? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2039.12s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2043.02s)]
*  No, no. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2044.02s)]
*  No, definitely not. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2045.02s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2046.02s)]
*  The staff is very disrespectful here. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2047.02s)]
*  Even though we made mistakes, when we're out here, we're not treated with respect. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2048.54s)]
*  Do you feel safe here? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2053.2999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2055.02s)]
*  I mean, prison is prison. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2056.02s)]
*  You feel what I'm saying? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2057.02s)]
*  Tell me about staffing. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2058.62s)]
*  There's short staff all the time. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2059.62s)]
*  There's times where you don't know if you're going to be able to go outside because somebody [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2062.38s)]
*  didn't come to work. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2065.46s)]
*  And if you were to speak up about some of these issues that you're telling me about, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2066.46s)]
*  what would happen? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2070.34s)]
*  You're going to the chute. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2071.34s)]
*  The chute, short for special housing unit, is the jail inside a prison, where inmates [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2073.82s)]
*  are segregated from the general population and seldom let outside of their cells. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2079.5s)]
*  Make you nervous to talk to me right now? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2084.78s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2086.42s)]
*  The director is coming today. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2087.42s)]
*  What does she need to know about Aliceville? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2089.1800000000003s)]
*  Fix it. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2091.3s)]
*  I think education, more like opportunity to grow and rehabilitate because we don't have [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2093.2200000000003s)]
*  that here. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2096.42s)]
*  I've talked to a handful of inmates here today and they say, look, you're getting a cleaned [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2097.42s)]
*  up version of what life is really like. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2102.38s)]
*  I've been doing this work for a long time, so I can see when things have been swept under [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2104.94s)]
*  the rug, if you will. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2109.94s)]
*  I'm not naive. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2111.2200000000003s)]
*  And when anybody comes to your house, you clean it up. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2112.7400000000002s)]
*  Of all the issues plaguing the Bureau of Prisons, perhaps none is more disturbing than the rampant [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2115.34s)]
*  sexual abuse of female inmates by the male officers who are supposed to protect them. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2120.62s)]
*  Women are housed in nearly a quarter of federal prisons and a 2022 Senate investigation found [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2126.42s)]
*  that Bureau staff have sexually abused female prisoners in at least two thirds of those [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2132.22s)]
*  facilities over the past decade. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2137.7s)]
*  Aliceville is no exception. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2140.3399999999997s)]
*  Three officers have been convicted of sexual abuse since 2020, including one who pleaded [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2142.8199999999997s)]
*  guilty earlier this month. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2148.06s)]
*  Those are just the cases that we know about. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2150.18s)]
*  How does this keep happening? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2152.2999999999997s)]
*  You can't predict human behavior, but what I can tell you is the things that we're putting [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2153.66s)]
*  in place to manage to that misconduct, I think are the right things and sending a clear message [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2157.62s)]
*  that this type of behavior is egregious, horrendous and unexcusable. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2163.74s)]
*  But female inmates at a women's prison in Northern California accused Director Peters [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2168.7799999999997s)]
*  and the Bureau of Prisons of failing to protect them. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2173.3199999999997s)]
*  Its official name is Federal Correctional Institution Dublin, but it's known by inmates [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2176.82s)]
*  and staff as the Rape Club. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2181.78s)]
*  Seven Dublin officers, including the warden and the chaplain, have been convicted of sexually [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2184.42s)]
*  abusing nearly two dozen inmates from 2018 to 2021. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2189.6800000000003s)]
*  And this past August, eight inmates filed suit claiming sexual abuse continues to this [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2194.94s)]
*  day. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2200.7400000000002s)]
*  These are mothers, their daughters, their sisters. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2201.7400000000002s)]
*  Tess Corth worked as a correctional officer at Dublin for 25 years. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2206.66s)]
*  She resigned in 2022 after she says she was retaliated against for whistleblowing. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2210.94s)]
*  They train us in the red flags to look for. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2216.4s)]
*  And then when we report, hey, every red flag this guy meets, you need to go deal with this. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2219.0s)]
*  They don't do anything. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2225.86s)]
*  What was the chaplain doing that made you suspicious? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2227.06s)]
*  One time I came in on a weekend. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2229.72s)]
*  He didn't know I was there. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2232.24s)]
*  His office was dark. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2233.9s)]
*  They had an inmate in there with him and I don't know what they were doing. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2235.38s)]
*  That's a red flag. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2240.54s)]
*  Oh, definitely. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2241.54s)]
*  Former officer Corth says she reported the chaplain and other officers who she suspected [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2243.82s)]
*  of sexually abusing inmates to an internal affairs investigator, but was ignored for [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2248.36s)]
*  years until federal investigators stepped in. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2253.48s)]
*  What happened to the officers that you accused? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2256.94s)]
*  Most of them have been or in the process of being convicted and a lot of them are named [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2259.98s)]
*  in lawsuits right now. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2267.6s)]
*  How's that make you feel? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2269.5s)]
*  Good. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2271.14s)]
*  The Bureau of Prisons has a backlog of nearly 8,000 open misconduct investigations, hundreds [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2272.64s)]
*  of which contain allegations of sexual abuse. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2278.46s)]
*  Director Peters hired more staff to tackle the backlog, but she says it will take two [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2281.98s)]
*  years to clear those cases. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2286.44s)]
*  In response to the Dublin lawsuit, Bureau of Prisons lawyers say inmates' claims have [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2288.96s)]
*  been investigated and that no threat remains. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2293.64s)]
*  We've done a tremendous job in the last year rebuilding that culture and creating a institution [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2297.0s)]
*  that is more safe where individuals feel comfortable coming forward and reporting claims. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2304.36s)]
*  You just use the phrase tremendous job in Dublin. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2310.26s)]
*  Inmates have filed a class action lawsuit and they've got testimony from more than [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2314.16s)]
*  40 current and former Dublin inmates who say that the abuse is ongoing. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2319.96s)]
*  That means the process is working, that they have the ability to come forward, they have [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2324.2799999999997s)]
*  the right to bring that class action lawsuit together. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2328.3999999999996s)]
*  These Dublin inmates say that they are facing retaliation for speaking out. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2331.12s)]
*  I have been very clear that retaliation will not be stood on my watch and so when allegations [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2334.64s)]
*  of retaliation come forward, they are investigated and we will hold those people accountable. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2340.28s)]
*  It's one thing for you to say that retaliation is not tolerated, but it sounds like it's [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2345.48s)]
*  actually still happening. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2350.2000000000003s)]
*  Again, I would say those are allegations. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2351.48s)]
*  I would like to be more grounded in fact around proven retaliation. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2353.8s)]
*  The fact is that an additional 19 staff members have been accused of abusing inmates. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2359.44s)]
*  The Bureau says those staff members have been put on leave, new management has been brought [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2365.0400000000004s)]
*  in and there are now working security cameras in areas where inmates were abused. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2369.66s)]
*  What are these victims owed? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2374.8999999999996s)]
*  To have individuals who are in our care who rely on us for their safety and security and [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2380.1s)]
*  to have that be violated? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2388.02s)]
*  I don't know that you can bring anything that would undo that wrong. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2389.96s)]
*  What about an apology? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2394.8599999999997s)]
*  The victims in Dublin say they've never received an apology. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2396.3s)]
*  Well, I will tell you that it is our mission to keep them safe. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2399.54s)]
*  That is our job. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2404.7000000000003s)]
*  Is your job to apologize for what happened in Dublin? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2405.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't know that my job is to apologize. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2408.26s)]
*  Is it heartbreaking and horrendous to have something like that happen when you are proud [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2410.96s)]
*  of your profession as a corrections professional? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2416.2200000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2419.38s)]
*  In addition to the lawsuit filed this past August, more than 45 current and former Dublin [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2421.16s)]

*  Improbably, while fighting for his own release, he taught himself English, wrote a bestselling [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2453.56s)]
*  book about his life in American custody and became good friends with some of his guards, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2459.14s)]
*  one of whom you'll hear from tonight. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2465.08s)]
*  Salahi spent about one third of his life at Guantanamo and his book offered an unprecedented [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2467.76s)]

*  Six weeks after he was released from Guantanamo, we went to North West Africa to meet him. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2484.72s)]

*  It sucks. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2498.3199999999997s)]
*  It's very challenging. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2501.0s)]
*  I don't know how to describe it in words, but you feel like humiliation, you feel self-pity, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2502.68s)]
*  you feel like panic. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2514.9199999999996s)]
*  I didn't have a plan. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2522.64s)]
*  I was learning as I was going. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2525.3199999999997s)]
*  Mohamedou Salahi is once again adapting to unfamiliar surroundings, this time home and [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2529.7599999999998s)]
*  freedom. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2536.64s)]
*  To learn how he went from here to Guantanamo and back again, we travelled to the Islamic [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2537.64s)]
*  Republic of Mauritania. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2543.0s)]
*  It's a tribal and deeply religious nation of nearly four million people, where the Sahara [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2546.08s)]
*  Desert meets the sea. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2551.48s)]
*  Not the size of Texas and New Mexico combined, the country is due east of Cuba, separated [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2554.52s)]
*  from Salahi's old prison home by the width of the Atlantic. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2561.48s)]
*  You know what's there? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2565.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2566.68s)]
*  Guantanamo Bay. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2567.68s)]
*  About 3,800 miles in that direction. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2568.68s)]
*  I say goodbye, hope never to see you again. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2574.44s)]
*  Before we explain how Salahi ended up in Guantanamo in the first place, we'll tell you how a [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2579.52s)]
*  talent for languages helped him survive there. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2585.16s)]
*  How much English did you speak when you landed in Guantanamo? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2589.0s)]
*  Almost none. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2592.24s)]
*  In the office of his new apartment in Mauritania, Mohamedou Salahi showed us how he learned [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2594.88s)]
*  English in Guantanamo. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2600.16s)]
*  He reads and writes his fourth language with some help from the US Navy. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2602.2s)]
*  Where did you get those glasses? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2606.52s)]
*  I got from Navy hospital in Guantanamo Bay. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2608.52s)]
*  Thank you doctors. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2613.6s)]
*  And they had choices. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2614.6s)]
*  And I took the ugliest one. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2616.68s)]
*  You chose? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2618.88s)]
*  As a sign of protest. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2619.88s)]
*  He was his own teacher in Guantanamo, soaking up new vocabulary wherever he could. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2621.64s)]
*  I'm letting you now into my world. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2627.6s)]
*  This how I learned the English language. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2631.4s)]
*  This is the original. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2633.52s)]
*  So you would, what, hear something and write it down? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2634.52s)]
*  Hear something, write it down and ask. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2637.64s)]
*  And then ask a guard? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2639.56s)]
*  Ask a guard or interrogator. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2640.56s)]
*  How do you spell that? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2641.56s)]
*  Whomever I meet. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2642.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2643.56s)]
*  To chortle. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2644.56s)]
*  To chortle. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2645.56s)]
*  That's a very good word. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2646.56s)]
*  To chortle. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2647.56s)]
*  Chortle. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2648.56s)]
*  To skyscraper, riot, suicide. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2649.56s)]
*  You were just working on building your vocabulary. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2655.4s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2657.12s)]
*  I take this and then I just go in myself back and forth and memorizing everything, every [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2658.12s)]
*  day. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2662.08s)]
*  You threaded her fingers through that thick mane of exquisitely dyed hair. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2663.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2667.0s)]
*  What were you reading? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2668.0s)]
*  I think that was Yaya's sisterhood. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2669.0s)]
*  In 2005, three years after he arrived at Guantanamo, Salahi used his new language skills to demand [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2672.7599999999998s)]
*  his immediate release. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2679.52s)]
*  He handwrote his own petition for a writ of habeas corpus, a legal document challenging [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2681.56s)]
*  the US government's right to imprison him. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2687.72s)]
*  He also began a correspondence with his American lawyers that became the Guantanamo Diary. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2690.84s)]
*  It's been translated into 27 different languages, but it took seven years for his legal team [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2697.28s)]
*  to convince the government to allow its publication, and they only permitted a heavily censored [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2703.28s)]
*  version. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2709.28s)]
*  It's like I was shouting in the dark for years, then I saw a very small hole that I could [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2710.28s)]
*  shout through, which was my lawyer. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2717.32s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen this before. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2720.64s)]
*  It is the original copy of the review of your book in the New York Times. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2724.24s)]
*  Have you seen it before? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2734.2799999999997s)]
*  Never. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2736.2799999999997s)]
*  First time. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2737.2799999999997s)]
*  You were locked in a prison with so little contact with the outside world, and meanwhile [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2742.44s)]
*  your work was being discussed. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2749.2799999999997s)]
*  That shows the greatness of American people, not my greatness, because American people [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2752.2s)]
*  believe in justice and they decided to give me a forum, to give me a voice. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2759.56s)]
*  By 2004, the US government regarded him as a cooperative prisoner, so Salahi was living [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2765.8s)]
*  in a special segregated hut. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2772.0s)]
*  He had access to books, movies and his own vegetable garden, but he was still a prisoner [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2774.64s)]
*  struggling with solitude 4,000 miles from home. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2780.3599999999997s)]
*  You can bet your bottom dollar that I was lonely. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2784.44s)]
*  In the book, you describe the guards as your family. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2787.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2791.48s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2792.48s)]
*  They really, a lot of them, treated me as a brother. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2794.3599999999997s)]
*  We found one of Salahi's former guards, who asked us to disguise his appearance and withhold [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2799.84s)]
*  his name. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2805.48s)]
*  He had security concerns because of his work at Guantanamo. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2806.8s)]
*  How long did you guard him for? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2810.6800000000003s)]
*  Ten months. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2812.08s)]
*  And when was that the first time you met him? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2813.4s)]
*  In July of 2004. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2815.7200000000003s)]
*  Any first impressions? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2817.7200000000003s)]
*  Just that he wasn't this horrible terrorist that I was expecting to go guard, that I was [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2820.04s)]
*  told everybody there is the worst of the worst and this guy comes out with a smile on his [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2826.28s)]
*  face. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2829.8s)]
*  So straight away you started thinking, this is not what I was expecting. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2830.8s)]
*  I felt something was off, definitely. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2834.48s)]
*  You didn't think he was going to harm you? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2836.76s)]
*  No, if he wanted to, I mean there were times where we slept while he was sleeping and his [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2838.7200000000003s)]
*  door was open and like if he wanted to kill us he could have. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2843.36s)]
*  But you were pretty sure he wasn't going to do that? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2846.8s)]
*  Yeah, I had no issues. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2849.04s)]
*  You trusted him? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2850.84s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2852.2000000000003s)]
*  He was very shocked because he told me, they told him this is the worst of the worst. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2853.28s)]
*  And I wasn't very open to the guards because I was afraid of them. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2861.2400000000002s)]
*  But he kept poking me until we opened up to each other. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2866.44s)]
*  It was a very good time with him. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2871.36s)]
*  We'd play Monopoly or a lot of Rummy, watch movies like over and over and yeah, just hanging [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2873.2000000000003s)]
*  out with us. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2880.5600000000004s)]
*  We heard there was one film in particular that you guys watched over and over. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2881.56s)]
*  The Big Lebowski, like non-stop, like he could quote it like word for word like a giant portion [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2886.64s)]
*  of the movie. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2893.62s)]
*  It was hilarious. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2894.62s)]
*  I mean, I was struck by that. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2895.62s)]
*  What's interesting about The Big Lebowski is they get the wrong guy. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2897.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2900.96s)]
*  You got the wrong guy. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2901.96s)]
*  I'm the dude, man. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2902.96s)]
*  I'm not your guy. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2903.96s)]
*  You played a role in Mohamedou Salahi's release. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2906.7599999999998s)]
*  He wrote a letter to the review board that decided on whether he would finally be released. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2910.9s)]
*  I think, is that the letter there? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2916.94s)]
*  That is. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2919.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2920.6600000000003s)]
*  I just want to read you a section of it. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2921.6600000000003s)]
*  You said, based on my interactions with Mr. Salahi while in Guantanamo, I would be pleased [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2923.56s)]
*  to welcome him into my home. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2929.42s)]
*  Based on my interactions, I do not have safety concerns if I were to do so. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2931.58s)]
*  I would like the opportunity to eventually see him again. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2935.98s)]
*  For sure. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2939.8s)]
*  Last year, when the military's periodic review board finally cleared him to go home, Salahi [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2941.7000000000003s)]

*  He was smiling. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2955.88s)]
*  The most beautiful smile I've ever seen in my life. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2958.34s)]
*  He said, you know you're leaving? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2961.28s)]
*  I said, no, I didn't know. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2964.32s)]
*  What were you feeling? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2966.38s)]
*  I was feeling happy, but I always learned not to over-celebrate because so many people [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2968.2s)]
*  received clearance, but they lingered in prison for so many years, including to this day. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2977.92s)]
*  You didn't want to jinx it. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2985.92s)]
*  I never heard jinx it, but I presume it's the right word here. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2987.92s)]
*  He says he was flown home from Guantanamo Bay the same way he arrived, shackled and [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=2993.26s)]

*  More than 10 hours in a chair. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3004.86s)]

*  Salahi's long road to Guantanamo began not with the war on terror, but with another war [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3023.5s)]

*  In 1988, correspondent Harry Reasoner and producer George Crile travelled to Afghanistan [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3035.0200000000004s)]

*  He persuaded the US to arm the Mujahideen, a band of holy warriors who were fighting [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3050.62s)]
*  the Soviet Union and their communist allies. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3056.94s)]
*  A few years later, Salahi, who was studying in Germany, decided, along with thousands [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3060.22s)]
*  of other Muslim men from around the world, to join the battle against the communists. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3067.54s)]
*  This was a big coalition, including my country and your country. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3073.14s)]
*  What made you decide to go to Afghanistan as a young man? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3076.82s)]
*  I saw those horrific pictures of people, children, being gassed. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3080.7400000000002s)]
*  And I said I want to do something. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3087.78s)]
*  Then that's when I decided to travel and I took a visa and then I went there twice. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3090.3s)]
*  You thought you were fighting for a just cause? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3098.1800000000003s)]
*  Yes, I was sure then. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3100.2200000000003s)]
*  I did not know. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3102.6600000000003s)]
*  Today I know. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3103.94s)]
*  In Afghanistan, Salahi was trained to fight. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3105.78s)]
*  Not by the Afghans, but by a group of foreign fighters dedicated to the cause. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3108.84s)]
*  At the time, they were led by a young, charismatic leader called Osama bin Laden. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3114.0800000000004s)]

*  When I saw that the Afghans were butchering each other, I was completely disgusted. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3126.6000000000004s)]
*  The first time you went to Afghanistan, what did your family think? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3133.18s)]
*  They thought I was a nitwit. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3137.8199999999997s)]
*  A nitwit? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3140.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3141.62s)]
*  I should never have gone to Afghanistan. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3142.62s)]
*  I had a scholarship that many people in the whole world dreamed to have. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3145.94s)]
*  And what I did, I threw everything away and I went to Afghanistan. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3151.58s)]
*  This is the definition of a nitwit. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3158.24s)]
*  When you left Afghanistan for the second time, did you still consider yourself a member of [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3162.04s)]
*  Al-Qaeda? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3168.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3169.0s)]
*  I cut all my ties with the organization. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3170.56s)]
*  To me, I joined for the sake of participating in jihad in Afghanistan. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3173.4s)]
*  Jihad in Afghanistan turned into a quagmire. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3181.56s)]
*  I did not want to be part of a civil war. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3184.94s)]
*  I went back, thank God I resumed my studies, I finished college and I worked to help my [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3189.2s)]
*  family. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3195.3599999999997s)]
*  Salahi denies he ever had anything to do with terrorism, but he doesn't deny that some of [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3197.3599999999997s)]
*  his friends were still members of Al-Qaeda. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3202.3999999999996s)]
*  He also had a cousin who was a spiritual advisor to Osama bin Laden. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3205.64s)]
*  That was really the trouble. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3210.68s)]
*  That was where the trouble began. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3212.4399999999996s)]
*  One day in 1999, he got a phone call from that cousin, a man known as Abu Hafs. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3214.52s)]
*  And if you had known at the time that he was calling you from bin Laden's satellite phone? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3221.24s)]
*  I would have burned his house down. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3226.16s)]
*  Would you have taken the call? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3228.4s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3229.88s)]
*  But looking back, it's better that I took it, that the people who were listening know [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3230.88s)]
*  what I was talking about. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3234.64s)]
*  That was where the trouble started, honestly. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3236.32s)]
*  After 9-11, the United States government made catching Salahi a priority. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3239.52s)]
*  And the Mauritanians were happy to help their powerful ally. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3244.96s)]
*  On November 20, 2001, secret police knocked on the door of his mother's house. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3249.2s)]
*  He followed them back to their station, driving his own car. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3255.4s)]
*  Is it over here? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3259.16s)]
*  That's the car. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3260.96s)]
*  15 years later, it still sits in the exact place where he parked it. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3261.96s)]
*  Wow, it's a bit of a wreck. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3267.0s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3268.96s)]
*  Is this the right licence plate? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3269.96s)]
*  This is my licence plate. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3270.96s)]
*  Is it yours? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3271.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3272.96s)]
*  It's kaput. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3273.96s)]
*  After eight days in a Mauritanian jail, his government handed him over to the CIA, who [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3275.84s)]
*  flew him to a prison in Jordan where he spent eight months. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3281.16s)]
*  US agents then took him to Bagram Air Base near Kabul, Afghanistan. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3284.8s)]
*  After two weeks there, he was put on a military transport plane for the long trip to Cuba. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3290.36s)]
*  At what point did it hit you in the stomach? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3296.48s)]
*  I'm really in a jam here. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3300.28s)]
*  It doesn't actually. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3302.56s)]
*  You would be surprised. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3304.6s)]
*  If there is no hope, there is no life. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3305.6s)]
*  In Guantanamo, Mohamedou Salahi's special interrogation plan was personally approved [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3310.76s)]
*  by Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3316.64s)]
*  The treatment he received has since been outlawed. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3319.68s)]
*  In a moment, Salahi describes what happened to him. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3323.1s)]
*  Of the nearly 800 men who've been incarcerated at some point in Guantanamo Bay, Prisoner [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3337.38s)]

*  while he was still detained in the prison. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3350.66s)]
*  Published in 2015, it is a unique first-person account of life in Guantanamo and America's [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3353.58s)]
*  now outlawed Enhanced Interrogation Program. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3360.3s)]
*  When Salahi arrived at the prison, his time spent in Afghanistan in the early 1990s and [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3364.14s)]
*  connections to al-Qaeda made him a top priority for US intelligence. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3369.74s)]
*  We begin the second part of our story by asking Salahi the same questions his interrogators [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3375.14s)]
*  asked him over and over. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3380.74s)]

*  No. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3387.22s)]
*  Did you have any prior knowledge of the 9-11 attacks? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3388.66s)]
*  Absolutely none, whatsoever. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3392.22s)]
*  And when you saw on television those attacks, what did you think? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3395.18s)]
*  It was heartbreaking, you know, knowing that those people, just like my family, children, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3402.42s)]
*  men, women, just regular people who went to their war. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3408.7400000000002s)]
*  They didn't do anything to anyone. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3413.38s)]

*  When you discovered that it was the work of al-Qaeda, what did you think? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3419.1800000000003s)]
*  I thought this is evil. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3422.86s)]

*  Yeah, it's a very small holding cell that is cold and you don't see anything. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3490.5400000000004s)]
*  You don't see outside, completely cut off. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3497.34s)]
*  No daylight? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3501.6600000000003s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3502.6600000000003s)]
*  I remained there 70 days, continuous interrogation. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3503.6600000000003s)]
*  What do you mean by continuous? [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3509.6600000000003s)]
*  That means I had three shifts of interrogators. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3512.22s)]
*  Every day? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3517.06s)]
*  Every day. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3518.06s)]
*  Were you allowed to sleep at all? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3519.06s)]
*  There is between the night shift and the day shift, maybe two hours. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3521.8999999999996s)]
*  I don't know, it's not long. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3529.22s)]
*  I didn't have any feeling for time, really. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3530.8599999999997s)]
*  What did it do to you? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3534.3399999999997s)]
*  I lived in a haze. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3535.8799999999997s)]
*  I was very nervous, very angry, very easy to be angry and I was crying for the simplest [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3537.34s)]
*  reason. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3546.82s)]
*  What else happened? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3547.82s)]
*  They brought another marine guy. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3548.82s)]
*  He wore a marine. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3552.54s)]
*  It does not mean that he's a marine. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3554.26s)]
*  I'm just saying this for the record. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3556.94s)]
*  And then he kept pouring this water on me. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3559.78s)]
*  Then I kept really shaking. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3563.3s)]
*  He was pouring water on you? [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3564.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3567.18s)]
*  And then he said, answer me. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3568.18s)]
*  But I couldn't talk because my mouth couldn't move because I was very cold. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3570.2599999999998s)]
*  You were just too cold to talk? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3579.34s)]
*  Yes, I couldn't move my lips. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3580.98s)]
*  But it was another tactic that brought Salahi close to the edge. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3583.9s)]
*  An interrogator who claimed he'd been dispatched from the White House gave Salahi grave news. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3587.82s)]
*  He was shown a fictitious letter stating that his mother had been detained and might be [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3593.62s)]
*  transferred to Guantanamo. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3598.54s)]
*  There was no implication that she'd done anything? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3600.8199999999997s)]
*  No, he said only because I wouldn't confess. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3603.02s)]
*  The idea that she was going to be held with male prisoners was terrible for you? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3607.74s)]
*  That is an understatement. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3614.58s)]
*  What was your fear? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3616.96s)]
*  I can't even think about it. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3618.84s)]
*  I don't want to think about it. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3621.34s)]
*  Later, he was dragged from his cell and put on a boat. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3623.42s)]
*  They opened my mouth and put in salt water until I started choking. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3627.86s)]
*  They were forcing you to drink salt water? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3632.26s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3634.6600000000003s)]
*  What happened next? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3635.6600000000003s)]
*  So they start to fill me with ice cubes. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3637.02s)]
*  Inside your uniform? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3642.7400000000002s)]
*  Inside my uniform. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3644.98s)]
*  Ice cubes, full. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3646.98s)]
*  My body was full and then I was like shaking uncontrollably like this. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3648.62s)]
*  They start hitting me everywhere. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3652.7400000000002s)]
*  Hitting? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3654.62s)]
*  Beating you? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3655.62s)]
*  Yeah, beating me everywhere. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3656.62s)]
*  For how long? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3658.62s)]
*  Again, I didn't have feeling for a time, but it must have been three hours. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3660.62s)]
*  How much pain were you in? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3667.22s)]
*  I was moaning like a woman giving birth. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3669.62s)]
*  And what did you decide to do? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3675.42s)]
*  I decided I would tell them everything they wanted to know. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3676.9s)]
*  They broke you? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3682.7400000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3683.7400000000002s)]
*  They broke me. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3684.7400000000002s)]
*  I told the captain, the boss of my team, you write anything and I signed it. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3686.42s)]
*  And if you buy, I'm selling. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3695.7000000000003s)]
*  And you were lying to them? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3698.34s)]
*  Not everything I said. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3700.46s)]
*  My life, I told them my life truthfully. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3701.7s)]
*  But the crimes, I was lying about every single crime I falsely confessed to. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3704.34s)]
*  Salahi says he told his interrogators that he was an active recruiter for Al-Qaeda and [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3712.1s)]
*  was involved in a plan for a bombing in Toronto. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3718.18s)]
*  But that plot never actually existed. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3721.9s)]
*  Your life got a lot better. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3725.3s)]
*  Yes, dramatically better. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3727.02s)]
*  No more beating. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3730.2599999999998s)]
*  I was allowed to sleep. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3732.18s)]
*  I was afraid of false confessing. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3733.9399999999996s)]
*  But it was a relief. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3737.98s)]
*  Because now the captain could not torture me anymore because I gave him what he wanted. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3740.3399999999997s)]
*  Now he had to sell this first to the FBI, to CIA, and then they have to sell this to [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3745.2599999999998s)]
*  the military prosecution. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3753.22s)]
*  And those people are intelligent and smart. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3755.66s)]
*  And then what they pretty much told him, this is a bunch of BS. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3758.26s)]
*  You told them what they wanted to hear because you wanted the torture to stop. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3763.38s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3767.5400000000004s)]
*  I falsely confessed to crime. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3769.6600000000003s)]
*  It was bad business. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3771.5s)]
*  Bad business. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3774.1000000000004s)]
*  In 2004, the military officer chosen to prosecute Salahi resigned from the case saying later [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3775.1000000000004s)]
*  that he was, quote, convinced that Salahi had been the victim of torture. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3781.5400000000004s)]
*  Not by anything Salahi said, but solely from US government documents from the intelligence [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3786.62s)]
*  databases, detailing specifically what had been done to him during the interrogations. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3792.42s)]
*  In 2010, a federal judge ordered Salahi's release and wrote there is ample evidence [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3798.62s)]
*  that Salahi was subjected to extensive and severe mistreatment at Guantanamo. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3804.66s)]
*  Evidence gathered through torture has complicated the government's military prosecutions at [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3811.42s)]
*  Guantanamo. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3816.14s)]
*  There have only ever been eight convictions and three were later overturned. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3817.68s)]
*  You were one of the worst tortured in Guantanamo, so you're in a unique position to answer this. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3823.14s)]
*  Does torture work? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3829.62s)]
*  In what way? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3833.5s)]
*  If it's working, it's bringing pain on me, yes. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3835.06s)]
*  If working is giving false confessions, yes. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3838.2999999999997s)]
*  If works is giving good intelligence, no. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3843.94s)]
*  If it works, resulting in my conviction, hello, I'm here for 15 years and not even charged, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3848.46s)]
*  let alone being convicted. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3858.5s)]
*  So how can you convince anyone possibly who has a shred of intelligence that it works? [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3860.38s)]
*  How did you manage to not lose your sanity? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3869.2400000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3872.7s)]
*  That the premise here that I did not lose my sanity. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3873.7s)]
*  This psychiatrist told me 760, that's what they called me. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3877.54s)]
*  You are really very sick. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3883.06s)]
*  Sick with what? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3885.9s)]
*  Psychologically. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3887.2599999999998s)]
*  I was hearing noises. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3888.58s)]
*  Hearing voices? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3891.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3892.38s)]
*  What were they saying? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3893.38s)]
*  It was my family just talking to me every day. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3895.7799999999997s)]
*  And this wouldn't stop. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3898.42s)]
*  And then this came to me, this doctor, and they helped me. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3900.7s)]
*  They gave me medications over many years, heavy medications. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3904.54s)]
*  And I was helped. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3909.62s)]
*  They gave you psychiatric medicines? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3910.7799999999997s)]
*  Yes, Taxol, Clonopin, and you've seen Sopranos? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3912.9399999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3918.46s)]
*  What did he take? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3919.46s)]
*  Prozac, things like that. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3921.58s)]
*  They gave me a lot of these stuff. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3923.62s)]
*  How's your health today? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3925.46s)]
*  I don't have time to think about pain, which is good. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3927.42s)]
*  The pain will go away. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3931.7000000000003s)]
*  But you didn't really answer my question, Mohamedou. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3933.62s)]
*  Are you dealing with psychological trauma? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3935.94s)]

*  Of course. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3948.34s)]
*  I still have nightmares. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3949.42s)]
*  I still wake up and I think I'm in Guantanamo Bay. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3951.02s)]
*  At 46 years old, freedom has been a major adjustment. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3955.94s)]

*  that he's come home with his dignity intact. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3972.14s)]
*  He's been embraced by a large extended family, including some members who weren't yet born [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3977.42s)]
*  when he disappeared. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3983.42s)]
*  So he's been a new discovery? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3984.94s)]
*  Yeah, many. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3987.62s)]
*  So this is your mum's house. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3988.62s)]

*  on his way to Guantanamo. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=3997.66s)]

*  She passed away in 2013. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=4005.3s)]

*  It's seared in my memory. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=4013.74s)]
*  That picture froze in time. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=4018.5s)]

*  At times during our trip to Mauritania, he seemed exhausted. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=4048.3s)]
*  But there was almost always a smile on his face. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i_nhdL3f5E&t=4054.58s)]
