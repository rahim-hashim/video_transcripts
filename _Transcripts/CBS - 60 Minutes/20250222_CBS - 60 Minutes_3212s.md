*  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=0.0s)]
*  . . . [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=9.0s)]
*  Every now and then, just for the fun of it, we decide to go off to some obscure place that you've never heard of and are not likely to visit. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=13.0s)]
*  Tonight, we're taking you to EGG, or the People's Republic of EGG as it's jokingly [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=21.0s)]
*  referred to in Scotland, a country where half the privately held land is owned by fewer [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  than 500 people. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=31.18s)]
*  A lot of it is tied up in huge estates owned by lairds, who often run them as fiefdoms. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=33.08s)]
*  Twenty years ago, after two centuries of servility, the people of EGG drove away their laird and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=38.92s)]
*  seized control of their own destiny, establishing the first community-owned estate in Scotland's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=44.54s)]
*  history. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=49.98s)]
*  We wanted to see what they'd made of it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=50.98s)]
*  Just three miles wide, six miles long, and ten miles off the Scottish coast, EGG is part [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=54.9s)]
*  of the Inner Hebrides, surrounded by the isles of Rum, Muck and Skye at the edge of the North [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  Atlantic. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=66.97999999999999s)]
*  It's an ungroomed masterpiece of nature, too wild to tame. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=69.3s)]
*  A craggy isle of incredible beauty populated mostly by sheep and the dogs that keep track [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=73.17999999999999s)]
*  of them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=79.42s)]
*  The people do their best to stay clear while taking everything in. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=81.58s)]
*  So what's your average day like? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=85.94s)]
*  Some people would say very lazy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=88.14s)]
*  I like to think I just make the hard work look easy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=91.14s)]
*  All depends on your outlook. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=96.78s)]
*  Charlie Galley is the taxi driver on EGG and the only source of public transportation up [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  and down the island's furrowed main artery. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  It's a niche he claimed for himself when he arrived from the mainland with his wife and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=107.58s)]
*  this aging Volvo four years ago. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=111.78s)]
*  Plenty of time to get the feel of the place. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=114.58s)]
*  You know everybody on the island? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=117.25999999999999s)]
*  I know them and their shoe sizes and like I say there's no stickers on an island. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=119.86s)]
*  So what are they talking about this week? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=126.3s)]
*  Mainly you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=129.26s)]
*  It's not like they don't get visitors. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=132.7s)]
*  12,000 tourists came here last year, most of them to spend only a few hours. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=134.70000000000002s)]
*  There are very few places to stay. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=139.06s)]
*  We were going to be here for days asking questions about EGG's quirky history and everyone directed [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=141.66000000000003s)]
*  us to Maggie Fife, the island's secretary, who landed here 41 years ago after touring [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  Afghanistan in a camper. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=152.98000000000002s)]
*  I never imagined that I would spend the rest of my life here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  So you like it? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=159.38000000000002s)]
*  It was 1976, just after the entire island had been purchased by a wealthy English toff [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=162.45999999999998s)]
*  named Keith Schellenberg who became the seventh laird of EGG. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=168.82s)]
*  Welcome to EGG. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=173.45999999999998s)]
*  Under Scotland's feudal landlord system, he had absolute power over virtually every aspect [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=174.54s)]
*  of his estate. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=180.5s)]
*  What kind of impact did he have on people's lives? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=181.77999999999997s)]
*  He had that control over everything, people, jobs, houses and he wouldn't give anybody [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  a lease on anything. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=189.92s)]
*  By all accounts, Schellenberg used the island as his personal playground, lavishly entertaining [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=191.82s)]
*  guests and driving about in a 1927 Rolls-Royce while most of his tenants lived in poverty [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=197.1s)]
*  without electricity. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=204.1s)]
*  Was there a rebellion? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  Eventually, yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  It started with a slow burn that burst into flames one night in 1994 when Schellenberg's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=211.45999999999998s)]
*  beloved Rolls-Royce met a fiery end, burnt to a crisp like a slice of bacon under circumstances [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=217.54s)]
*  still unexplained. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=224.94s)]
*  A mysterious fire, spontaneous combustion, who knows. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  So did you ever figure out what happened to the Rolls-Royce? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=232.2s)]
*  No. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=235.78s)]
*  Headline writers all over Britain couldn't believe their luck. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=237.45999999999998s)]
*  There was scrambled egg, burnt rolls and egg comes to the boil. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=240.66s)]
*  It went on for a year until Schellenberg gave up, expressing his disdain for the islanders [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=245.62s)]
*  in this BBC interview. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  I think that my ultimate failure with egg is that I can't be bothered to try and get [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  on with them anymore. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=257.98s)]
*  His final act was to sell the island to a wacky German who called himself Maruma and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=260.2s)]
*  claimed to be an artist of note and a professor. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=265.18s)]
*  He turned out to be neither. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=268.06s)]
*  Up to his beret and debt, Maruma stopped paying people's wages and within two years, creditors [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=269.94s)]
*  put egg up for auction. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=275.22s)]
*  Maggie Fife and others thought, why not buy the island for ourselves? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=277.18s)]
*  By the time we got to Maruma and two years of somebody that was living in Stuttgart and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=281.58000000000004s)]
*  had only visited for four days, it convinced everybody that we wouldn't have to do very [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=287.14000000000004s)]
*  much to do better than what he'd done, which was nothing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  No one in Scotland had ever tried a community buyout before. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  Maybe not 64 residents on a depressed, undeveloped island with no cash or credit. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=302.3s)]
*  But lots of people were familiar with their story and fancied the idea of Wee Folk taking [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=308.38s)]
*  on the big guys. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=313.6s)]
*  In 1997, a public fundraising campaign brought in $2.5 million to close the deal. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=315.5s)]
*  The funds came from 10,000 individual contributors and one huge check from an unknown woman. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  The bulk of the money came from a mystery benefactor. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=329.14s)]
*  A mystery benefactor? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=333.53999999999996s)]
*  Sounds like Dickens. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=335.5s)]
*  It's a pretty crazy story, really. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=336.94s)]
*  You don't know who she is? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=339.26s)]
*  The only string attached was that she remained anonymous. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=340.34s)]
*  She ever been to the island? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=343.53999999999996s)]
*  Not as far as I know. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=344.53999999999996s)]
*  Do you know why she did it? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=346.46s)]
*  I think she's given money to a lot of what she regards as good causes and we were lucky [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=347.5s)]
*  enough to be one of them. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=352.06s)]
*  That was 20 years ago. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=356.82s)]
*  The Eggers and their friends marked the two decades of self-rule with a big blowout they [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=358.3s)]
*  call a Cayley. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=362.7s)]
*  With traditional music, dancing and drink. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=365.82s)]
*  We decided to cancel the next day's shoot to allow time for recovery, but 24 hours wasn't [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=376.86s)]
*  enough. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=382.42s)]
*  What time did you leave the Cayley? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=384.7s)]
*  It was about 8am I think when we finally left. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=386.5s)]
*  How long did it take you to recover? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=389.9s)]
*  It took probably tomorrow. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=391.82s)]
*  Johnny Jobson first experienced Egg in his 20s working on a fishing boat as a scallop [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=394.53999999999996s)]
*  diver. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=399.97999999999996s)]
*  Since then a lot has changed. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=401.38s)]
*  One there is electricity now, which allowed him to move his wife and family here last [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=404.46s)]
*  year and added a sports journal online from their tiny cottage. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=409.38s)]
*  It's required some sacrifices, but they love the beauty of the place and its eccentricities. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=414.26000000000005s)]
*  You look at the scenery or you see a pod of dolphins come through and you just remind [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=420.5s)]
*  yourself how lucky you are. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=426.70000000000005s)]
*  You seem to have a lot of characters on this island. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=428.38000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=430.54s)]
*  Were they normal when they came here? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=431.54s)]
*  Um, yeah, not all of us. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=434.14000000000004s)]
*  Dean Wiggin turned up in a kayak 14 years ago and he's still here. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=438.46000000000004s)]
*  He's very good at fixing things. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=443.02s)]
*  Jobs are extremely scarce so you have to bring one with you or use your wits to invent one. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=446.5s)]
*  It's one of those places that really gets into your soul. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=451.9s)]
*  I think it's quite enchanting. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=454.58s)]
*  Sarah Bowden runs her uncle's sheep farm on Egg. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=457.62s)]
*  She grew up here, then left to work as a music journalist in London where she met her future [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=460.65999999999997s)]
*  partner, Johnny Lynch, one of Scotland's most popular musicians. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=467.18s)]
*  She coaxed him to Egg. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=473.22s)]
*  Did you think he was going to come? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=475.18s)]
*  Not really. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=476.78000000000003s)]
*  No, because I was living in a caravan at the time and it was all quite rustic. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=477.78000000000003s)]
*  You did look a bit shocked. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=487.18s)]
*  And Johnny's, you know, proper suburban city. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=489.38s)]
*  What? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=492.38s)]
*  Well, you're not a natural country boy, are you? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=493.38s)]
*  If you mean I look after my nails, then yes, yes I do. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=495.98s)]
*  But yeah, I knew from when I got here I couldn't really see a reason for me to go back and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=499.82s)]
*  just look at me now. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=506.46000000000004s)]
*  Look at your nails. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=507.94s)]
*  See if you can spell it. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=509.5s)]
*  When it comes to the essentials on Egg, there is basically one of everything. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=511.04s)]
*  One primary school for five students, one grocery shop where a hundred islanders all [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=515.44s)]
*  the same food, and one pub at the tea room down by the wharf where the best beer is local. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=521.4200000000001s)]
*  Stu McCarthy and Gabe McVarish, who were both married to women who grew up on Egg, got so [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=528.74s)]
*  tired of drinking the mass-produced stuff from the mainland they started their own mini [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=534.0600000000001s)]
*  microbrewery two years ago. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=538.84s)]
*  So this is it? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=541.3000000000001s)]
*  Is this legal? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=542.3000000000001s)]
*  It's legal. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=543.3000000000001s)]
*  It's legal. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=544.3000000000001s)]
*  They make eight different brews including I Am the Egg Man, which is very popular with [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=545.5s)]
*  the tourists. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=549.8599999999999s)]
*  They're just beginning to turn a profit but say they've saved a lot of money drinking [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=550.8599999999999s)]
*  their own beer. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=555.02s)]
*  Are you the biggest selling beer on Egg? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=556.02s)]
*  Thankfully, yes. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=558.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we can say that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=560.3s)]
*  None of these younger people would be here without the island's tiny but unique power [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=564.2199999999999s)]
*  grid that runs almost entirely on renewable energy. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=568.64s)]
*  A combination of wind, hydroelectric and solar. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=572.74s)]
*  The first time it's ever been accomplished anywhere. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=577.4599999999999s)]
*  That is the biggest and most impressive project that we've done. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=580.5799999999999s)]
*  It changed everything, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=584.5799999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's made life so much easier. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=585.5799999999999s)]
*  It was designed and funded with multiple grants, mostly from the European Union, and engineers [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=588.3s)]
*  from all over the world have come to study it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=593.3399999999999s)]
*  Like everything else on Egg, it is run and maintained by revolving committees of islanders, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=596.38s)]
*  the only visible sign of any sort of government. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=602.18s)]
*  There are no offices, no court system, no police. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=604.8199999999999s)]
*  Is there any crime on the island? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=608.9399999999999s)]
*  There's no crime or anything. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=609.9399999999999s)]
*  Never? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=612.14s)]
*  Not that I can remember. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=613.14s)]
*  Nobody's snatched something or borrowed something? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=614.6999999999999s)]
*  They borrow it and you'll get it usually within the week, you know, returned to you kind of [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=618.2199999999999s)]
*  thing. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=624.3399999999999s)]
*  You just don't know where it is at that point in time when you're looking for it. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=625.3399999999999s)]
*  But it will turn up again. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=628.5799999999999s)]
*  It can't go anywhere. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=629.5799999999999s)]
*  It's on an island. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=630.5799999999999s)]
*  What happens if somebody gets sick? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=631.86s)]
*  Well, you basically have to be sick on a Tuesday. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=633.14s)]
*  A doctor comes from Skye on a Tuesday, spends the day here, and that's sometimes weather [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=636.0200000000001s)]
*  permitting if it's really rough in the wintertime. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=642.6600000000001s)]
*  Egg is dependent on boats for everything. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=645.4200000000001s)]
*  When a ferry comes in with fuel and food, people flock to the wharf to help out. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=647.86s)]
*  It's not a courtesy, it's a necessity on an island where everyone is more or less scraping [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=653.1s)]
*  by. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=657.98s)]
*  To survive, they have to rely on each other, look after each other, and put up with each [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=659.22s)]
*  other. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=663.94s)]
*  The island is too small for feuds or lingering resentments. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=664.94s)]
*  What's the difference between people who live on the mainland and people who live on egg? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=669.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, the people on egg, I'd have to say, are more evolved. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=673.54s)]
*  Charlie Galley, the taxi driver and amateur philosopher, says most people here have done [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=679.38s)]
*  the whole life on the mainland thing and rejected it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=684.58s)]
*  They're all doing their hamster wheel thing, you know. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=688.1s)]
*  Hamster wheel? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=690.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=691.26s)]
*  You get a mortgage, you get a car, you get a job, you do this and that next thing, and [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=692.26s)]
*  they all get so involved they forget to look about them and see what's actually going on [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=695.9s)]
*  in life, you know. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=700.1s)]
*  You should know egg is not always served sunny-side up. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=703.5400000000001s)]
*  As the days get shorter, the windy, rainy weather turns to sleet with gusts up to 100 [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=707.14s)]
*  miles an hour. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=712.9s)]
*  The boats might not get through for a week, so people keep lots of beans and spam in the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=714.1s)]
*  store room. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=718.86s)]
*  Even the sheepdogs look forlorn. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=720.4200000000001s)]
*  If you accidentally open your mouth when a gust of wind's coming and it involuntarily [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=722.94s)]
*  fills your lungs, you're like... [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=726.98s)]
*  To live here, you have to be resilient, self-sufficient and patient. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=730.5400000000001s)]
*  And not just with the sheep. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=738.14s)]
*  The cows like to go down and lie on the beach on the sand and they'll all trail down the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=740.42s)]
*  road, so you can't argue with a cow, you know. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=745.02s)]
*  It wants to do what it wants to do and you've just got to give it plenty of time, you know. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=748.74s)]
*  There are no grand ambitions here and no discernible interest in development despite the sea, the [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=753.98s)]
*  cliffs and the vistas. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=759.1s)]
*  The owners don't want hotels or a Donald Trump golf course or hundreds of new residents. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=761.22s)]
*  I think we're looking for one or two at a time. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=766.3s)]
*  I think that's how it works here. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=768.4599999999999s)]
*  Then it works a lot better. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=770.5799999999999s)]
*  And we've got time to get used to new people. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=772.8199999999999s)]
*  We would have liked to stay longer in this stress-free, non-conflict zone where everyone [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=779.14s)]
*  seems to be more or less on the same page. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=783.74s)]
*  But we were out of clean laundry, we had a ferry to catch and hamster wheels to jump [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=786.5799999999999s)]
*  back onto. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=791.06s)]
*  As for the people of Egg, I don't think they were sad to see us go. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=792.9599999999999s)]
*  We're going to be back! [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=798.3s)]
*  On this Easter Sunday, we thought it would be fitting to take you on a journey to Easter [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=811.0999999999999s)]
*  Island. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=815.14s)]
*  It's one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world, far into the Pacific, 2200 miles [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=816.14s)]
*  due west from the coast of Chile. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=822.06s)]
*  Dutch explorers gave it its name after they spotted it on Easter Sunday in 1722. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=824.7s)]
*  What they found has fascinated and confounded the world ever since. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=830.86s)]
*  Giant stone statues, the tower over the island's landscape. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=835.22s)]
*  They're called Moai. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=839.5s)]
*  And as we learned our first morning on Easter Island, there's nothing quite like them anywhere [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=840.5s)]
*  else in the world. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=845.94s)]
*  When dawn breaks on Easter Island, it is the Moai that first feel the sun. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=848.38s)]
*  These 15 Moai at a site called Tangariki are perhaps the most famous. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=855.46s)]
*  Carved out of volcanic rock, they're placed on a stone platform called an Ahu. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=860.74s)]
*  The tallest is nearly 30 feet. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=865.74s)]
*  They stand, strange, silent sentinels, facing away from the sea, watching over the land [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=868.18s)]
*  and its people. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=874.78s)]
*  At least a thousand Moai can be found scattered across this island, which is about the size [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=876.46s)]
*  of Washington, D.C. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=881.4200000000001s)]
*  Many more Moai remain buried underground. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=883.26s)]
*  To the descendants of those who built them, these are more than statues made of stone. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=886.5s)]
*  They are immortal branches of an ancient family tree. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=891.5s)]
*  The Moai represents an ancestor. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=895.58s)]
*  And we believe in ancestor that goes beyond this life, but is helping us, guiding you. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=898.42s)]
*  Is a Moai a distinct individual ancestor, or can it also be the family line of that [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=906.8199999999999s)]
*  ancestor? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=913.42s)]
*  Both. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=914.42s)]
*  Pedro Edmonds-Paooa is the longtime mayor of the only town on Easter Island. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=915.42s)]
*  So when you see the Moai today, it's not just something from the past, it's something that [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=920.38s)]
*  is alive, that has power right now. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=925.0999999999999s)]
*  Yes, we indigenous people from this island believe in that. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=927.9s)]
*  The indigenous people here believe their ancestors and family lines are represented by specific [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=932.6999999999999s)]
*  groups of Moai. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=938.3399999999999s)]
*  Mayor Edmonds-Paooa says his are at a site called Tahai. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=940.0s)]
*  My genealogy traces all the way to that site 85 times. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=943.98s)]
*  It goes back that far? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=948.62s)]
*  Yes, more than a thousand years. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=949.98s)]
*  That is entirely possible. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=952.62s)]
*  No one knows for sure the exact date the first people came here, but it's believed to have [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=954.54s)]
*  been somewhere around 800 to 1200 years ago. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=959.14s)]
*  Archaeological evidence indicates they sailed from an unknown island in Polynesia, a dangerous [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=963.0999999999999s)]

*  Those first settlers brought with them their tradition of carving, but they made much smaller [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=973.2199999999999s)]
*  statues. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=977.62s)]
*  They also brought a belief in a mystical force called mana. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=978.62s)]
*  How do you describe mana? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=982.74s)]
*  What is mana? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=984.16s)]
*  Mana is beyond description. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=985.16s)]
*  If we were to describe it in today's language, it's knowledge. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=989.4s)]
*  Knowledge. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=993.12s)]
*  We interpret it as wisdom, as an energy that gives you strength. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=994.12s)]
*  Do the Moai still have mana? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=999.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1001.4s)]
*  It has soul. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1002.4s)]
*  It has life. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1003.4s)]
*  They're alive? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1004.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1005.4s)]
*  According to legend, when important islanders died, their mana flowed out of their bodies [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1006.4s)]
*  into the Moai. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1012.28s)]
*  The mana is here. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1014.04s)]
*  The mana is here. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1015.66s)]
*  It's a hard concept for my small mind to imagine. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1016.92s)]
*  For human like you guys from the city don't understand these things because you worry [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1020.1999999999999s)]
*  about working like disciplined animals. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1024.82s)]
*  Those who believe in mana say it's not just in the Moai. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1030.08s)]
*  It can be found in everything here. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1033.48s)]
*  In the waves that constantly crash ashore, in the rocky soil and in the green grass that [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1035.76s)]
*  blankets the island. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1042.08s)]
*  These objects in the middle of what looks like a barren landscape, they speak to you. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1044.0s)]
*  They draw you in. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1048.52s)]
*  They make you want to know more. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1049.52s)]
*  I think that that's the power of them. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1052.9199999999998s)]
*  And when you see how tall they really are. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1055.04s)]
*  Joanne Van Tilburg is a UCLA professor of archaeology. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1057.24s)]
*  She's been coming here for nearly 40 years, working with local researchers and artists, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1060.8799999999999s)]
*  excavating and cataloging the statues, trying to understand the mysteries and what she calls [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1066.4399999999998s)]
*  the magic of the Moai. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1071.56s)]
*  They're tight-lipped, these statues. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1073.6s)]
*  They don't give up their secrets easily. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1075.6s)]
*  And they don't give them up to outsiders easily. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1078.6s)]
*  To learn the Moai's secrets, you have to start where nearly all of them were made. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1081.48s)]
*  Around the vent of a dormant volcano, this is the ancient quarry of Rana Raraku. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1086.36s)]
*  There are some 400 Moai here, more than in any other spot on the island. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1091.8s)]
*  The largest one, never raised upright, is almost 70 feet long and weighs at least 250 [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1097.28s)]
*  tons, as heavy as some passenger jets. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1103.6s)]
*  Based on excavations Joanne Van Tilburg and other archaeologists have done, an analysis [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1107.44s)]
*  of soil samples and objects found around the statues, Van Tilburg believes the height of [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1112.68s)]
*  Moai construction was around 1300 to the mid 1400s, though Moai did continue to be carved [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1118.08s)]
*  until, or just after, their first contact with Europeans in 1722. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1125.0s)]
*  I mean is it not possible with carbon dating or other scientific techniques to know exactly [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1130.68s)]
*  when something is made? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1135.8s)]
*  Unfortunately not. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1136.8s)]
*  You can't date stone, this stone, in that manner. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1137.8s)]
*  When the first archaeological survey was done on the island in 1914, all the Moai, except [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1141.56s)]
*  those in the quarry, were found lying on the ground. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1146.8s)]
*  There are several plausible theories how they got there. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1150.1200000000001s)]
*  Some statues may have simply fallen from neglect, others were knocked over in earthquakes, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1153.16s)]
*  and some were intentionally toppled during fighting between competing family groups. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1158.52s)]
*  Today, some Moai are only partially visible, just their famous faces stick out of the ground. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1163.3200000000002s)]
*  The rest of their bodies are buried under sediment that's naturally built up over the [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1169.48s)]
*  centuries. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1173.68s)]
*  This one is at least only about one third above ground. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1174.68s)]
*  Wow, so two thirds of these are actually below ground? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1178.1200000000001s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1180.72s)]
*  At first glance, the Moai all look alike, but Van Tilburg says no two are the same. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1181.72s)]
*  How are they different? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1187.92s)]
*  Well, they're different in the line of their mouth, they're different in of course their [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1188.92s)]
*  size and shape, they're different in their expressions, whether their head is tilted [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1191.72s)]
*  up or lowered slightly or to the side. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1195.66s)]
*  These two Moai, they're unfinished? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1197.98s)]
*  They're unfinished. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1200.16s)]
*  Visitors here have long debated how the Moai were made, given the stone age conditions [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1201.16s)]
*  on the island when the statues were being carved. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1206.1200000000001s)]
*  Van Tilburg says the answer is all around. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1209.1200000000001s)]
*  There are thousands of stone carving tools scattered throughout the quarry. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1212.28s)]
*  This was a hand held instrument that was used and if you hold it you can actually feel where [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1216.2s)]
*  people may have put their fingers, which was actually used to rough out the sculpture. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1220.16s)]
*  You can actually feel the sort of the hand? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1224.64s)]
*  Yeah, you can. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1226.6000000000001s)]
*  Wow, that's amazing. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1227.6000000000001s)]
*  Isn't that cool? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1228.6000000000001s)]
*  And this was literally just laying ten feet away. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1229.6000000000001s)]
*  And you put it in your hand and you can feel where the other person's hand was who actually [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1231.4s)]
*  used this. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1234.96s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1235.96s)]
*  History and magic, that's it right there. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1237.0s)]
*  But magic alone couldn't move the Moai from the quarry to sites on the coast, in some [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1239.28s)]
*  cases more than eight miles away. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1243.92s)]
*  That took muscle and ingenuity. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1246.6000000000001s)]
*  Van Tilburg has tested a theory she believes, that Moai were placed horizontally on sleds [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1249.48s)]
*  and dragged over logs. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1255.3600000000001s)]
*  Island legend says the statues walked and some archaeologists have tested that theory [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1257.6000000000001s)]
*  as well. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1265.56s)]
*  Moving them upright, carefully wobbling them back and forth. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1266.76s)]
*  You may have also heard an out of this world theory about space aliens making and moving [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1271.16s)]
*  the Moai. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1276.0s)]
*  It may sound ridiculous, but it's still believed by many visitors today. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1277.0s)]
*  You must have people asking you about extraterrestrials building these. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1282.0s)]
*  Yes, yes I do. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1286.16s)]
*  So I just have to ask, any possibility of that? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1287.32s)]
*  You don't believe it though? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1290.8799999999999s)]
*  No, I don't believe it. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1292.8799999999999s)]
*  Easter Island was annexed by Chile in 1888. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1293.88s)]
*  Half of the 8,000 people who now live here are Chilean immigrants. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1300.0800000000002s)]
*  The other half are modern descendants of those original Polynesian settlers. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1304.1200000000001s)]
*  They call themselves and the island Rapa Nui. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1308.8400000000001s)]
*  In 2017, Chile finally gave them control of the National Park where the Moai and other [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1312.5600000000002s)]
*  important archaeological sites are located. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1317.96s)]
*  The park covers more than 40% of the island. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1321.04s)]
*  The island of Rapa Nui was formed out of volcanic rock starting some 3 million years ago. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1324.88s)]
*  There are now three dormant volcanoes that dominate the landscape. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1330.36s)]
*  This one is called Rano Kau. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1333.82s)]
*  No one knows exactly how many archaeological sites there are on the island, but this place [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1335.76s)]
*  is like a living museum constantly battered by the sun, the wind and the rain. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1339.96s)]
*  Those three elements are over time destroying the Moai. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1346.82s)]
*  These statues may look as though they're solid stone, but they're actually quite porous. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1350.72s)]
*  Joanne Van Tilburg showed us a small piece of the soft volcanic rock called tuff that [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1355.44s)]
*  the Moai are made from. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1360.56s)]
*  Tuff has really special qualities where it can be carved and it can be polished quite [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1362.48s)]
*  easily. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1366.2s)]
*  It's good for sculpting because with a harder stone it's able to be chipped away easily. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1367.2s)]
*  Correct. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1371.4s)]
*  So the very material which made these statues possible also long term makes them very vulnerable. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1372.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1380.0s)]
*  Rainwater and airborne seeds get into the pores of tuff, gradually breaking it apart. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1381.2s)]
*  The wind whittles the stone away over time and further damage is done by birds and a [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1386.72s)]
*  type of algae called lichen. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1392.0s)]
*  Some Moai are in worse condition than others. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1394.52s)]
*  Take a look at this one called Tukuturi. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1397.08s)]
*  This photograph is from 1955 when it was unearthed. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1399.5s)]
*  This is how Tukuturi looks today. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1403.2s)]
*  The stone breaks very easily. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1406.04s)]
*  It is just not stable. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1407.48s)]
*  Essentially they're dissolving. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1409.16s)]
*  Yeah, they are. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1410.76s)]
*  I mean, if they're standing out in the rain they're melting like sugar cubes. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1411.76s)]
*  Like sugar cubes in the rain. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1414.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1416.2s)]
*  It's that dramatic. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1417.2s)]
*  In the 1990s, with help from the Japanese government, the 15 Moai at Tongarii, which [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1418.2s)]
*  had fallen or been toppled over, were reconstructed along with the stone platform they now stand [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1423.28s)]
*  on. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1428.88s)]
*  The UN has declared Easter Island a World Heritage Site and efforts to slow the disintegration [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1430.1200000000001s)]
*  of the statues with a chemical sealant have been underway for decades. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1435.46s)]
*  But so far only about 20 Moai have been treated. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1439.58s)]
*  The process is expensive, money the island doesn't have. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1443.5s)]
*  It's also not a permanent solution. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1447.42s)]
*  The sealant only delays the inevitable. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1449.8600000000001s)]
*  One day these Moai will likely disappear. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1452.54s)]
*  Is there a plan, a conservation plan, an environmental plan for long term in the future? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1455.5s)]
*  No. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1461.02s)]
*  There's not? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1462.02s)]
*  None. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1463.02s)]
*  None at all. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1464.02s)]
*  Mayor Pedro Edmonds-Pauoa is frustrated. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1465.58s)]
*  There's a lack of consensus among the Rapa Nui about how to preserve the Moai. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1468.54s)]
*  And the island's infrastructure is under pressure from all the tourists who want to [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1473.66s)]
*  come see the statues. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1477.58s)]
*  A few decades ago there were only two incoming flights a week. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1479.42s)]
*  Now there are two almost every day. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1485.02s)]
*  Cruise ships also make regular calls, just long enough for passengers to get off the [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1488.98s)]
*  boat, grab some souvenirs and snap a few selfies. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1493.42s)]
*  In all, 120,000 tourists visited last year. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1499.78s)]
*  That's too much. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1503.74s)]
*  If tourism continues to grow, is that sustainable here? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1504.88s)]
*  No, it's not sustainable. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1508.22s)]
*  Christian Moreno-Pacarati is a historian who earns his living training tour guides. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1510.6200000000001s)]
*  Do you have concerns about the impact of tourism? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1515.8200000000002s)]
*  So in material terms, the community has never been better. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1518.54s)]
*  But in general, it's much less friendly than it was some time ago. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1523.06s)]
*  He says the more the island caters to tourists, the less like home it is for the people whose [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1528.54s)]
*  ancestors built the Moai. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1533.1s)]
*  Today we are kind of forced to see the statues from far away, just like the tourists that [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1535.3s)]
*  come here. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1539.56s)]
*  People of my generation, right? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1540.56s)]
*  We could go there and touch the statues and be part of the statues and hug the statues. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1542.58s)]
*  How can I explain to my son today that my son cannot do that? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1548.98s)]
*  Despite no longer being able to touch them, he still feels the same sense of wonder he's [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1555.06s)]
*  always experienced when visiting the Moai. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1559.9s)]
*  You've been here probably thousands of times. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1562.7s)]
*  Yeah, thousands of times. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1564.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1565.58s)]
*  No, it's still awesome. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1566.58s)]
*  It's something that you still feel awe when you're here. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1567.66s)]
*  Christian Moreno-Pacarati supports the efforts to preserve the Moai, but believes it'll take [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1570.9s)]
*  more than mana and money. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1575.86s)]
*  He has his own somewhat radical idea on how to ensure the Moai keep standing. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1578.78s)]
*  The only way to keep them alive is to keep alive the art of making and moving statues. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1583.42s)]
*  So you would like to see the people of Rapa Nui making new Moai? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1590.3s)]
*  That's right, because these will disappear one day. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1594.46s)]
*  So if the art of making them is still alive, we will never lose the statues. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1597.08s)]
*  A remote jewel of land off the coast of Canada, Fogo Island floats in the northeast corner [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1608.02s)]
*  of the northeast province of Newfoundland and Labrador, the outstretched right fingertip [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1620.58s)]
*  of this continent. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1625.5s)]
*  The place might be drop-dead gorgeous, but it wasn't immune to the fate befalling so [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1627.06s)]
*  many small and isolated communities in North America. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1631.46s)]
*  Its one and only industry went into steep decline, and so in turn did its population. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1635.3s)]
*  Then about a decade ago, a local returned home, fresh off making a fortune in the tech [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1640.8999999999999s)]
*  sector. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1645.94s)]
*  Her pockets were deep, so was her desire to lift up the place and bring people back. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1646.94s)]
*  So she unleashed a sort of economic experiment. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1652.18s)]
*  We took two planes, a long drive, and a ferry to reach Fogo Island and check on the early results. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1654.96s)]
*  The saying here goes, you'll know the Newfoundlanders in heaven. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1661.02s)]
*  They'll be the ones who want to go home. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1667.82s)]
*  And the adage comes to life on Fogo Island, a 90-square-mile patchwork of ten minuscule [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1671.1399999999999s)]
*  fishing villages where clapboard houses the color of jelly beans cling to rock 400 million [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1676.82s)]
*  years old. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1683.18s)]
*  Among its quirks, Newfoundland has its own time zone, half an hour ahead of the mainland. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1684.7s)]
*  But wander through Fogo Island's villages and you might as well set your watch back [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1691.58s)]
*  to the 18th century. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1696.34s)]
*  Back then, all you needed to get by here was a pig, a potato patch, and something called [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1698.86s)]
*  a punt. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1705.3799999999999s)]
*  A small wooden fishing boat used in pursuit of North Atlantic Kai, the species that once [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1707.26s)]
*  kept this place afloat. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1713.3s)]
*  Seemingly every structure on the island was built in service of catching and preserving [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1716.18s)]
*  fish. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1720.5s)]
*  With one gleaming exception, a $40 million luxury inn. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1722.0s)]
*  Part edge-of-the-earth destination, part economic engine on stilts, the inn is the brainchild [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1727.06s)]
*  of eighth-generation Fogo Islander Zeta Cobb. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1732.48s)]
*  And locals gave her a funny look when she first floated the idea. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1735.58s)]
*  What kind of reaction did that get? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1739.7s)]
*  Why would anyone come here? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1741.34s)]
*  We love this place, but it wasn't obvious when there are fancy places in the world that [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1743.06s)]
*  people go. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1747.12s)]
*  Our assumption is everybody wants to go where it's warm. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1748.3799999999999s)]
*  Someone suggested to us it looked like a ship. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1751.1s)]
*  The architecture of the inn was obviously a topic of much conversation. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1753.66s)]
*  I think about it as a metaphor. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1758.02s)]
*  It's about people from here and people from away. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1760.26s)]
*  It's about the future and the past. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1763.1399999999999s)]
*  The past looms large on Fogo Island. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1765.52s)]
*  To fully appreciate the inn, even as a metaphor, you have to understand Fogo's history. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1768.36s)]
*  Just something. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1773.6399999999999s)]
*  Zeta Cobb took us through dozens of tiny islands that dot Fogo's waters to a place called Little [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1774.6399999999999s)]
*  Fogo Island. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1780.4399999999998s)]
*  And for those keeping track, that's an island off an island off an island. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1782.24s)]
*  This is a slip. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1786.56s)]
*  Her ancestors landed here from Ireland in South England. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1787.56s)]
*  They came for one reason. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1790.8799999999999s)]
*  Fish, fish and fish. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1792.4399999999998s)]
*  When you say fish, is it just a given? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1794.1999999999998s)]
*  It's a given. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1797.44s)]
*  So yes, when we say fish, we mean cod. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1798.44s)]
*  Is it possible to exaggerate the importance of cod to this place? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1802.1200000000001s)]
*  No, it's not possible because everything that you need to know about someone from here, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1806.6000000000001s)]
*  you can figure it out by just studying that lowly fish. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1813.16s)]
*  It's actually quite a noble fish. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1815.8s)]
*  A noble fish? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1817.64s)]
*  It asks very little and gives so much. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1819.0s)]
*  They exist on almost anything. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1822.16s)]
*  I mean, I think a cod could eat a rubber boot if it had to. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1823.64s)]
*  But unlike the noble fish, Zeta Cobb's family survived without fuss. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1827.08s)]
*  In cod they trusted. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1831.72s)]
*  Families worked side by side here, trading their fish for goods. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1833.84s)]
*  No bank accounts, no cash. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1837.4399999999998s)]
*  Cobb's parents could neither read nor write. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1839.84s)]
*  She and her six brothers grew up in a house with no electricity. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1842.36s)]
*  She says it was a happy childhood, until it wasn't. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1846.1s)]
*  What happened? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1849.96s)]
*  The worst of the 20th century came down on top of us very quickly in the form of the [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1851.04s)]
*  industrialization of the fisheries. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1855.96s)]
*  So these enormous factory ships showed up here all along the coast of Newfoundland and [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1857.5600000000002s)]
*  fished day and night until just about every last fish was gone. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1864.0800000000002s)]
*  With one small punt launched from this one dock, Cobb's father couldn't compete with [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1868.0800000000002s)]
*  commercial vessels that had come to the North Atlantic from all over the world. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1872.88s)]
*  How bad did things get for him? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1877.44s)]
*  Things got, he would go out and come back with nothing. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1878.8000000000002s)]
*  One day in particular he came back with one fish and he brought the fish into the house [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1882.04s)]
*  and he slapped it down onto the kitchen floor and said, well, it's done. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1887.6200000000001s)]
*  And it was the next day he burned his boat. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1893.92s)]
*  He burned his boat? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1895.76s)]
*  He burned his boat. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1896.76s)]
*  It was almost like a sacrifice. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1897.76s)]
*  It was. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1899.64s)]
*  He did it as a statement. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1900.64s)]
*  He did it as an expression of pain and anger. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1902.16s)]
*  Lambert Cobb made this sacrifice once he realized that those big boats were, in his words, turning [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1907.76s)]
*  fish into money. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1913.8s)]
*  He said to me, as a 10-year-old, you have got to figure out how this money thing works [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1915.56s)]
*  because if you don't, it's going to eat everything we love. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1920.24s)]
*  He wasn't wrong. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1923.4399999999998s)]
*  As fish stocks dwindled, so did the island's population from 5,000 to 2,500. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1924.74s)]
*  The Cobbs left grudgingly for the mainland in the 1970s. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1930.62s)]
*  Zeta Cobb's father died shortly thereafter, but she heeded his advice. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1934.8s)]
*  She got a business degree, worked in fiber optics, landed in Silicon Valley, and before [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1939.68s)]
*  long was the third highest paid female executive in America. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1944.44s)]
*  In her early 40s, she cashed out tens of millions in stock options, dropped out of the winner-take-all [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1948.6599999999999s)]
*  economy and took her business savvy home, determined to revitalize Fogo Island. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1954.32s)]
*  Instead of writing a check, she posed a question. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1960.32s)]
*  What do we have and what do we know and how can we put that forward in a way that's dignified [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1963.44s)]
*  for Fogo Islanders and creates economy and connects us to the world. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1968.2s)]
*  Spend one night at what the locals call a shed party and the answer emerges. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1979.28s)]
*  When you think about the people of this place, if there's one thing we're really good at, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1985.76s)]
*  it's hospitality. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1990.04s)]
*  What does hospitality mean here? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1991.28s)]
*  Hospitality in its purest form is the love of a stranger. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1994.0s)]
*  We didn't get a lot of strangers and when they arrived, as my mother used to say, it's [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=1996.84s)]
*  always better to see a lake coming into the harbor than a lake going out. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2001.52s)]
*  So in 2013, Cobb built the biggest beacon in the harbor. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2005.36s)]
*  She made the Fogo Island Inn the centerpiece of a charitable trust called Shorefast, with [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2009.24s)]
*  profits reinvested in the island. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2014.52s)]
*  At $2,000 a night, the inn does turn a profit, but there were other considerations. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2017.02s)]
*  We're going to put a 29 room inn on an island that's never had an inn. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2022.46s)]
*  What are the consequences of that? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2027.3799999999999s)]
*  Well more people will come. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2028.66s)]
*  Well how many more people? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2029.9s)]
*  As one woman said, well you know we're only 2,500 people. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2031.46s)]
*  We can only love so many people at a time. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2034.46s)]
*  Shorefast and the inn employ more than 300 islanders, but the real payoff is the ripple [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2037.1399999999999s)]
*  effect. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2042.3s)]
*  For starters, all the furniture at the inn is locally made. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2044.46s)]
*  Same for the pillows and quilts. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2048.3s)]
*  It so happens the women of Fogo Island have been making them for their own homes for 400 [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2050.62s)]
*  years. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2055.58s)]
*  We're getting there. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2056.58s)]
*  We got half done. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2057.58s)]
*  Word is out now, this quilt is destined for a customer in Baltimore. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2058.58s)]
*  We joined the quilting bee, but didn't last long. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2063.18s)]
*  It was all very nice except for this one square. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2067.34s)]
*  This is our lettuce room. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2070.82s)]
*  Shorefast puts up seed money for new businesses too, a quarter of a million dollars so far. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2072.06s)]
*  And then you put your plant in. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2077.58s)]
*  A $7,500 microloan went to Dwight Budden and his father Hayward, a former fisher who left [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2078.98s)]
*  Fogo Island when the industry collapsed. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2085.1s)]
*  He's back now as a hydroponic farmer growing greens for the inn. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2088.98s)]
*  There's our kale. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2094.22s)]
*  Does Hayward eat kale? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2095.22s)]
*  Not too much. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2098.1s)]
*  Beyond the kale, new culture is taking root. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2100.5s)]
*  Futuristic-looking studios now speckle the landscape, part of Shorefast's ambition to [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2103.54s)]
*  bring artists and residents to Fogo. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2108.86s)]
*  And back at the inn, a chef turns cod into oat cuisine. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2112.38s)]
*  If your dad saw cod with magnolia oil and sea foam and porcini, what would he say? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2118.3s)]
*  Yes, first thing he says, can you really eat that? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2125.1s)]
*  You can do more than eat cod, you can fish for it again. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2127.74s)]
*  Now that a decades-long ban has been eased, Fogo Island's fishers are back hauling cod. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2131.54s)]
*  We ventured out of Fogo Harbor with brothers Glenn and Jerry Best, the fifth generation [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2137.22s)]
*  of their family to harvest these waters. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2143.22s)]
*  If you go east, your next stop is Ireland. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2145.3799999999997s)]
*  Ireland. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2147.7799999999997s)]
*  We're not going there today. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2148.7799999999997s)]
*  The Best brothers showed us the traditional Newfoundland way of fishing with a hand line, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2152.06s)]
*  150 feet down, no rods, reels or nets. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2157.46s)]
*  That's how we're talking. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2160.46s)]
*  That's the beauty. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2162.46s)]
*  Up comes cod, without much of a fight. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2164.1s)]
*  That's a nice cod. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2166.5s)]
*  That's probably a 20 pound fish. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2168.86s)]
*  Cod is making a comeback in the North Atlantic. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2171.14s)]
*  Canada still imposes catch limits, but when the Best get down to business, they use an [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2174.38s)]
*  automated system to drop thousands of hooks in the water at a time. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2180.38s)]
*  We watch them offload 20,000 pounds of cod from a single trip. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2184.66s)]
*  What's more, shellfish has done the unthinkable and dethrone cod as king. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2189.42s)]
*  Crab and shrimp now make up 80 percent of Glenn Best's business, and he's never had [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2195.04s)]
*  a better year. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2199.54s)]
*  You told me you caught 400,000 pounds of snow crab. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2200.54s)]
*  That's $7.60 a pound is $3 million. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2204.2999999999997s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2207.2999999999997s)]
*  That was a good year. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2208.2999999999997s)]
*  But a thriving fishery isn't always enough to keep the kids around. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2210.98s)]
*  Best's three children have moved away from Fogo to pursue other careers. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2215.02s)]
*  Your family's been doing this for generations. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2220.38s)]
*  You named this boat after your dad. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2222.38s)]
*  So the sad part about it is that Jerry and myself, we probably could be the last generation [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2225.34s)]
*  that will fish within our family. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2230.34s)]
*  When the day comes that that happens, that will probably be a sad day. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2232.86s)]
*  Still, Fogo Island's population has stabilized. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2238.94s)]
*  There's hope the next census will show an uptick. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2242.18s)]
*  Babies are the island's biggest celebrities. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2244.9s)]
*  But as ever, with growth come growing pains. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2247.5s)]
*  It's already become one of those islands where you have to pray to get a spot on the ferry. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2250.82s)]
*  Jennifer Sexton spent summers on Fogo Island visiting her grandparents. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2256.66s)]
*  She recently moved here from Western Canada to open this coffee joint where locals mix [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2261.5s)]
*  with those who come from away. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2266.38s)]
*  Everybody asks about the inn. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2268.86s)]
*  What do you tell them? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2269.86s)]
*  Well, it's a blessing and a curse. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2271.86s)]
*  Her regulars grumble that not long ago, they could get a home for $25,000. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2276.06s)]
*  Canadian. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2281.34s)]
*  Now, homes cost 10 times as much. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2282.34s)]
*  For somebody from away, that wouldn't be a lot. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2284.9s)]
*  But for somebody from here, that is a lot of money. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2287.1s)]
*  Zeta Cobb, the woman who turned this tide, says she doesn't want unchecked growth either. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2290.86s)]
*  As the economy grows, we will be smaller as a percentage of the whole economy. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2296.5s)]
*  A rare business leader that wants less market share. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2301.58s)]
*  We want less market share, exactly. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2304.7400000000002s)]
*  You said it with a smile on your face, but there's a lot of responsibility here. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2307.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the consequences are huge because, as my brother says, yes, our parents will [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2311.1s)]
*  get out of the graveyard and ring our necks if we mess this up. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2316.38s)]
*  What's your response to the capitalist who would say, why are you limiting your growth? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2320.02s)]
*  That is the techno-economic question. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2325.18s)]
*  But I start with a different question. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2328.34s)]
*  What are we optimizing for? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2329.42s)]
*  We are optimizing for place. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2331.14s)]
*  We're optimizing for community. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2332.7400000000002s)]
*  The pillars of this community have been won over. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2334.7000000000003s)]
*  If Cobb's experiment helps diversify the economy, Glenn Best says he's all in. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2337.44s)]
*  It's not like we're overrun by tourism. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2343.02s)]
*  That's not the way it works here. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2344.9s)]
*  We're not the Venice of Newfoundland. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2346.86s)]

*  On our last night at the Shed party, we got the full sweep of Fogo Island, its hospitality [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2352.34s)]
*  and its contrast laid out on the table. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2361.1800000000003s)]
*  Cod and crab, young and old, warmth, wit and this. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2364.5s)]
*  A traditional song delivered with a handshake, a kind of hope that comes tempered by history. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2371.02s)]
*  The undoing of this traditional way of making a life was very painful. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2378.94s)]
*  I think I still carry those broken hearts. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2384.94s)]
*  I think that kind of pain doesn't go away. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2387.1s)]
*  To what extent has that been repaired by the work you've done since you've come back? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2390.3s)]
*  Yeah, I think it actually does help. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2395.3s)]
*  You can heal a broken heart. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2396.7400000000002s)]
*  With what you've got, live well enough. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2400.54s)]
*  60 Minutes is constantly on the lookout for places we've never been before. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2418.54s)]
*  So when our late colleague Bob Simon heard about a magical place in the Hebrides Islands [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2423.5s)]
*  off the coast of Scotland known for making some of the great whiskeys in the world, well, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2428.5s)]
*  the story spoke to him. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2433.06s)]
*  The place is called Islay and it's one of five whisky producing regions in Scotland [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2434.98s)]
*  that make an expensive type of scotch called single malt. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2439.82s)]
*  Islay's distilleries turn out relatively small amounts of their own handcrafted brands for [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2443.5s)]
*  a worldwide luxury market that's more than doubled in size in the last decade and become [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2449.26s)]
*  the spirit equivalent of the fine wine business. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2454.46s)]
*  Bob liked good scotch and beautiful places, so he went off to Scotland. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2458.7400000000002s)]
*  He died before he could finish the piece, leaving behind a stack of videotapes and some [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2462.2200000000003s)]
*  random notes. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2466.76s)]
*  We decided to finish it for him and raise a glass in his memory. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2468.4s)]
*  Islay is a small island 20 miles off the west coast of Scotland. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2475.4s)]
*  There are few trees, miles of windswept heather, and some of the most fertile agricultural [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2479.32s)]
*  land in Scotland. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2484.6200000000003s)]
*  There are sheep and cattle everywhere and an abundance of wildlife. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2486.9s)]
*  But that's not why people come here. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2490.94s)]
*  This is, eight small distilleries that produce some of the world's finest single malt whiskeys. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2493.02s)]
*  This is the whole lifeblood of this island and everybody on it. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2499.46s)]
*  This is all we know. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2503.1800000000003s)]
*  Jim McEwen has been working at Islay's distillery since he was 15 years old. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2504.94s)]
*  He's now master of the works at Brooklottie. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2509.46s)]
*  I just thank God that he chose the Scots and gave them whisky because we appreciate the [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2512.46s)]
*  gift and we look after it. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2518.62s)]
*  They've been making it here since the 15th century when supposedly some monks taught [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2521.1800000000003s)]
*  the locals how to use barley, water and yeast to make a spirit the Scots now call the water [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2525.62s)]
*  of life. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2531.9s)]
*  They've been perfecting it for 600 years. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2533.1s)]
*  The distilleries are easy to find but hard to pronounce. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2535.78s)]
*  Ardbeg, Behmor, Brooklottie, Bunahobin, Collila, Kilhoman, Lagavulin and Laphroa. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2539.62s)]
*  As Bob Simon noted, they get harder to pronounce the more you visit. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2549.58s)]
*  For us guys on the west coast of Scotland, whisky is a religion because it's a provider. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2553.46s)]
*  The great thing about whisky is it's not just a drink. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2557.9s)]
*  It's much more than that. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2560.46s)]
*  Have you ever watched some old Hollywood movies? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2561.66s)]
*  Yes I have. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2563.94s)]
*  Scotch was always portrayed in Hollywood as a whisky when you were down or you were in [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2564.94s)]
*  trouble. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2569.06s)]
*  The one thing that was going to get you back in your feet and out there was the Scotch. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2570.06s)]
*  Today if you're down on your luck you probably can't afford an Islay single malt. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2574.98s)]
*  The good ones started around $70 a bottle. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2579.1s)]
*  The rare ones can go for hundreds of dollars a glass at chic whisky bars around the world [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2581.94s)]
*  where they're known for their distinctive smoky taste. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2587.14s)]
*  It comes from peat, the mossy earthen fuel that's cut from bogs on the island. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2591.02s)]
*  It was used to heat Scottish homes for centuries and is still used to toast the barley at Islay [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2596.42s)]
*  distilleries. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2602.22s)]
*  John Campbell is the master distiller at Laphroa, one of the top selling single malts in America. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2603.46s)]
*  Peat is the thing that makes Islay unique and it really resonates with people and it [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2608.78s)]
*  just engenders a kind of love-hate relationship and the people that love it absolutely love [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2613.06s)]
*  it with a passion. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2618.82s)]
*  And there seems to be no shortage of them. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2620.82s)]
*  Islay is not easy to get to, usually requiring multiple flights, a long drive and a two hour [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2624.06s)]
*  ferry ride. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2629.54s)]
*  Yet enthusiasts continue to make the pilgrimage, especially for the whisky festival. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2630.86s)]
*  We get literally thousands upon thousands of single malt tourists coming here. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2636.1400000000003s)]
*  They come from all over the world just to set foot on Islay. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2641.7000000000003s)]
*  To study it? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2645.2200000000003s)]
*  No, to drink it. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2646.2200000000003s)]
*  It's lovely. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2647.9s)]
*  It's clean, it's fresh, it's vibrant. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2648.98s)]
*  Officially, whisky fest is a celebration of Islay's culture, but mostly it's about drinking. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2651.6600000000003s)]
*  Absolutely beautiful. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2656.6600000000003s)]
*  No off-notes at all. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2658.38s)]
*  As they listen to Jim McEwen extol the virtues of brook Lottie, the novitiates, connoisseurs [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2660.06s)]
*  and whisky snobs approached each glass with reverence bordering on the religious. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2665.02s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2670.34s)]
*  The fruit in that is incredible. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2671.86s)]
*  As the glass is empty, the smiles got bigger. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2674.46s)]
*  But the islanders will tell you that all of this warmth and good feeling comes not from [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2677.22s)]
*  the alcohol and the spirits, but from the spirit of the place. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2681.8999999999996s)]
*  It is almost mystical, beautiful, dramatic and quiet. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2686.02s)]
*  There's no road rage, barely any traffic. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2691.1s)]
*  If you do get hung up, it's probably because of a farm animal. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2694.02s)]
*  They have the right of way. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2697.2999999999997s)]
*  And if you do happen upon people, they'll almost always greet you with the Islay wave. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2700.2999999999997s)]
*  Everybody just waves because it's just friendly. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2705.78s)]
*  There's not so many of us, so you just wave to say hi. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2707.86s)]
*  It's what Elsa Hayes liked about the island when she moved her family here from London [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2710.5s)]
*  to take a manager's position at one of Islay's thriving distilleries. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2715.1s)]
*  It's strange, is it not? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2718.9s)]
*  It's such a small place with so few people. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2720.06s)]
*  Your products are known everywhere in the world. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2723.9s)]
*  I know, but it makes us all very proud. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2727.54s)]
*  It does. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2729.7s)]
*  There's such a boom worldwide for single malts. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2730.46s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2735.58s)]
*  And you can really feel that on the island. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2736.26s)]
*  A lot of the distilleries have doubled production. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2738.14s)]
*  And so there's a lot of opportunities there as well. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2741.18s)]
*  And there's no reason to believe that that won't continue. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2743.98s)]
*  Well, times are good, people drink. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2746.9s)]
*  Times are bad, people drink. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2748.94s)]
*  Is it possible to be socially acceptable to be a teetotaler on this island? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2751.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2756.94s)]
*  Are there any? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2757.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2758.66s)]
*  No, I'm not one of them. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2760.1s)]
*  Over the years, the island's people have learned how to entertain themselves, often [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2763.38s)]
*  at gatherings called Cailies, which feature traditional dance and sad songs, mostly about [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2767.58s)]
*  leaving Islay and yearning to return. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2773.58s)]
*  To set with my love on the bridge above the rippling waterfall. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2776.22s)]
*  To go back home never more to roam is my dearest wish of all. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2787.14s)]
*  If this looks and feels a lot like Ireland, that's no coincidence. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2799.1s)]
*  It's only 25 miles away. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2802.8599999999997s)]
*  They come from the same tribe, share the same Celtic culture and Gaelic language, not to [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2805.2599999999998s)]
*  mention a love of good whiskey that gets them through stormy weather and the long winter [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2810.3399999999997s)]
*  nights. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2815.22s)]
*  There are no movie theaters on island, no dry cleaners, no supermarkets, no McDonald's, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2816.46s)]
*  at least in the fast food business. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2821.46s)]
*  Jim McEwen says there's a long list of things that Islay doesn't have and doesn't want. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2823.42s)]
*  We don't have any crime. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2828.78s)]
*  We don't have mugging, carjacking, house breaking, rape, just dope drugs. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2831.02s)]
*  We don't have that. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2839.02s)]
*  You can keep that. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2840.26s)]
*  You're very welcome to it. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2841.26s)]
*  How do you explain the fact that there's no crime here? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2842.54s)]
*  There's crime everywhere. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2845.14s)]
*  If you commit a crime in a small community, you'll be ostracized and have to leave. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2846.14s)]
*  Not only that, your family, your children and your children's children will be remembered [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2852.7799999999997s)]
*  as the children of the man who committed the crime. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2859.1s)]
*  Most Scots are forthright, practical people who are proud of their country and the fact [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2862.5s)]

*  manufacturing. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2875.86s)]
*  Every distiller has their own secrets and superstitions. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2877.42s)]
*  We'll give you the unclassified two-minute tour. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2880.2200000000003s)]
*  Sorry, we can't offer you free samples. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2883.7000000000003s)]
*  It begins with a bit of trickery on the molting floor when barley that's been soaked in water [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2887.14s)]
*  is spread out and raked over and over to convince the grain it's spring and time to germinate, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2892.42s)]
*  releasing the starches that are locked inside. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2898.66s)]
*  It's then dried with peat smoke to add flavor and ground into flour, sometimes with 19th [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2901.8599999999997s)]
*  century machinery and then mixed with hot water, transforming the starches into a sugary [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2908.3799999999997s)]
*  concoction called mash. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2914.8599999999997s)]
*  Smell that, Bob? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2916.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2917.94s)]
*  Isn't that it? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2918.94s)]
*  You can smell the goodness. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2919.94s)]
*  Yeast is then added, changing the sugar into alcohol, a primitive ale which is then cooked [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2920.94s)]
*  a couple of times in copper stills where the vapor is collected and condensed into this [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2926.14s)]
*  clear liquid. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2931.42s)]
*  And that's the stuff we want to go into the barrel. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2932.42s)]
*  But what I'm looking at is this looks like rubbing alcohol. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2935.18s)]
*  This is in fact a whiskey. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2938.66s)]
*  It's very good. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2939.66s)]
*  If you need a rub, there's no doubt about it. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2940.66s)]
*  I bet it would be good. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2942.34s)]
*  But once this goes into the barrel, from then it's just time. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2944.06s)]
*  It's just time. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2946.7799999999997s)]
*  It's a great journey, you know. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2947.7799999999997s)]
*  This is a child, but the cask is the mother. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2950.18s)]
*  And that's what makes the journey. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2953.82s)]
*  If you give a good cask, you're bound to get a good child. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2955.26s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2958.7400000000002s)]
*  It takes less than three weeks to make, but requires at least ten years of aging in these [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2959.9s)]
*  oak casks, which add flavor and color to turn it into world-class single malt whiskey. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2964.34s)]
*  You'll see some of the names. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2969.7000000000003s)]
*  There's Clement Springs, Buffalo Trees, Jim Beam. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2971.86s)]
*  Bob was surprised to learn that 97% of the casks used to make single malt whiskey had [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2977.3s)]
*  been previously used to age American bourbon and bought secondhand from U.S. distillers. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2982.9s)]
*  It's testimony to the ingenuity and frugality of the Scots, who have very few oak trees. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2989.1800000000003s)]
*  Without the American bottle, there would be no whiskey industry. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2994.54s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2997.1s)]
*  A sophisticated palate will detect a hint of the oak and bourbon in eyeless single malt, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=2998.34s)]
*  as well as the sweetness of sherry that comes from wine casks bought in Europe. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3003.42s)]
*  Before the final product is sold, it will have done time in a number of different casks. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3008.3s)]
*  Master distiller Jim McEwen is the one who decides when to rotate them and when each [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3014.1400000000003s)]
*  barrel is ready to be bottled. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3018.5800000000004s)]
*  He opened a young cask for Bob to sample. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3020.82s)]
*  I would describe that as mellow yellow. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3023.34s)]
*  Absolutely pure. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3026.46s)]
*  And it's only seven years old. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3028.6200000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3030.26s)]
*  Young whiskeys are like young people. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3031.26s)]
*  They're vibrant. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3032.26s)]
*  They're full of life. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3033.26s)]
*  In fact, this for me is like coming home from work. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3034.26s)]
*  At the end of the day, I work really hard. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3037.82s)]
*  Nobody appreciates me. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3041.6600000000003s)]
*  My wife doesn't appreciate me. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3042.82s)]
*  My kids don't appreciate me. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3044.0200000000004s)]
*  Life's a bitch. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3046.1000000000004s)]
*  A couple glasses of that and it doesn't matter. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3047.1000000000004s)]
*  A couple of shots of that and I am the king of the world. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3049.3s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3052.5s)]
*  You know, frankly, I never liked this stuff, but the way you're talking me into it. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3053.5s)]
*  But you've got to check every barrel. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3057.26s)]
*  I certainly hope so. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3058.6600000000003s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3060.1400000000003s)]
*  McEwen is the man responsible for the taste and consistency of the whiskeys at Brooklottie, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3061.38s)]
*  which requires a very personal involvement with the product. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3066.58s)]
*  I have heard you described as the cask whisperer. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3069.98s)]
*  I do talk to casks. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3073.78s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3076.3s)]
*  In what language? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3077.62s)]
*  Mainly English and depends on many whiskies I've had. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3078.62s)]
*  If I've done a few whiskers, I tend to revert to the Gaelic language. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3082.3s)]
*  I'm talking to the cask. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3085.06s)]
*  It's just one of these things. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3086.78s)]
*  You go into the warehouse and you pop the bung out, you draw your sample, yeah, and [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3087.86s)]
*  you look at it and you think, wow, you're beautiful. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3093.1400000000003s)]
*  But you're not just ready yet. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3095.86s)]
*  Tell you what, I'm going to come back and see you in three months, okay? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3098.02s)]
*  And other times you find a cask which is so incredibly good, you can't not speak. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3101.98s)]
*  Oh my God, you are the most beautiful thing I have ever tasted in my life. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3107.9s)]
*  You know, and you think, oh, jeez, I just want to share this with somebody. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3112.82s)]
*  But there's nobody around. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3116.46s)]
*  There's just me and the cask. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3117.46s)]
*  We'll stay. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3118.7400000000002s)]
*  On most days, McEwen devotes several hours to quality control, checking up on several [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3120.7s)]
*  hundred casks. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3125.42s)]
*  But it's a fantastic job, nosing and tasting whiskies. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3126.42s)]
*  And you can still walk out of here in the evening. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3131.7200000000003s)]
*  Occasionally I need some help. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3133.58s)]
*  There's no doubt about that, yeah. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3135.14s)]
*  Dying devotion to one's whisky is apparently not all that unusual. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3138.42s)]
*  While we were on Isleb, the camera crew ran into a party of Canadians, the friends and [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3142.74s)]
*  family of a deceased single malt lover named Bill, who wanted his ashes scattered in the [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3147.66s)]
*  waters opposite his favorite distillery. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3152.9799999999996s)]
*  Funds for the pilgrimage were set aside in his will. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3156.54s)]
*  That's why I want it. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3159.18s)]
*  It's good. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3162.18s)]
*  It's good. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3163.18s)]
*  To Bill. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3164.18s)]

*  Now he's happy. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3171.18s)]
*  Now he's happy. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3172.2999999999997s)]
*  After that, the only thing left was for Bob to say goodbye to Jim McEwen. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3176.2999999999997s)]
*  And it turned out to be last call for our old pal, Bob Simon. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3180.66s)]
*  Cheers, Bob. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wONkqb6ey9w&t=3184.7799999999997s)]
