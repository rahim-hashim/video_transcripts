# Slaughterhouse cleaning company employed kids; Lithium Valley; James Nachtwey | Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [May 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0)
*  Acting on a tip from a middle school, federal investigators discovered a major American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=0.0s)]
*  company sending children to work in slaughterhouses. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  And what did you find? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=18.0s)]
*  That there were miners employed across the country between the ages of 13 and 17 working [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=19.0s)]
*  the overnight shift. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=24.3s)]
*  This was not a mistake. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=25.84s)]
*  There's no way that this was just a mistake. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=27.32s)]
*  How many miners did you identify? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=29.48s)]
*  102 miners at 13 different plants in eight different states. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=31.44s)]
*  East of San Diego and south of Palm Springs lies the Salton Sea, California's largest [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=39.76s)]
*  inland body of water. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=45.8s)]
*  Spreading east from the sea is a giant mineral-rich geothermal field boiling with potassium, sodium [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=48.08s)]
*  and lithium. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=55.08s)]
*  The region is being called Lithium Valley and it's about to change the auto industry [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=56.68s)]
*  worldwide. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=61.96s)]
*  In the darkest times and in the most dangerous places, James Knockway captures beauty and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  brutality, moments of hate and heroism, senseless destruction and quiet acts of compassion. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=73.6s)]
*  Mothers and fathers are my heroes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=83.08s)]
*  What they do for their children, how they protect them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  Being in places where people have next to nothing and yet anything they have they offer [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  to a stranger. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=94.19999999999999s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=99.6s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=102.16s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=103.52s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=104.72s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=106.16s)]
*  85 years ago, the United States outlawed child abuse in sweatshop labor, a scourge that Franklin [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=114.96s)]
*  Roosevelt called this ancient atrocity. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  So it was a shock in 2022 to learn that an American company owned by a Wall Street firm [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=129.24s)]
*  sent children as young as 13 to work in slaughterhouses. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=136.4s)]
*  The disgrace was more disturbing because the company, PSSI, is vital to national food [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=141.32s)]
*  safety and its owner, Blackstone, claims to be a model of management. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=147.76s)]
*  Both companies say they had no idea they employed children in eight states, but it was obvious [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=153.84s)]
*  to teachers in Grand Island, Nebraska, who noticed acid burns on a child. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=161.44s)]
*  In our story, you will see only two photos of children working in a slaughterhouse. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=171.44s)]
*  Because of privacy, two with obscured faces are all the U.S. Department of Labor would [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=177.16s)]
*  give us. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=182.86s)]
*  But two may be enough. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=184.28s)]
*  Their hard hats read PSSI for Packers Sanitation Services, Inc., the nation's leading slaughterhouse [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=187.44s)]
*  cleaning service, with 15,000 workers in 432 plants taking in more than a billion dollars [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=196.28s)]
*  a year. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=204.48s)]
*  Not, it seemed, a likely abuser of children. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=205.48s)]
*  It seemed possible, but not necessarily likely. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=210.4s)]
*  And if it were possible, you know, maybe it was someone who'd slipped through the cracks. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=214.2s)]
*  Chanin Rebilleto is a 17-year Labor Department investigator who was skeptical, but she went [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=220.16s)]
*  to Grand Island, Nebraska, last summer after a middle school told police about acid burns [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=227.16s)]
*  on the hand and knee of a 14-year-old girl. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=234.28s)]
*  The student explained that she worked nights in this slaughterhouse on the edge of town. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=238.08s)]
*  What did the educators at Walnut Middle School tell you? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=244.52s)]
*  It seemed to be known within the community that minors either are or were working overnight [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=248.64s)]
*  shifts. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=256.76s)]
*  They told us about children that were falling asleep in class, that had burns, chemical [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=257.76s)]
*  burns. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=262.44s)]
*  They were concerned for the safety of the kids. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=263.44s)]
*  They were concerned that they weren't able to stay awake and do their job, which is learning [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=266.2s)]
*  in school. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=271.96s)]
*  Because they'd been up all night. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=272.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=274.76s)]
*  They were up all night at the JBS slaughterhouse, an immense plant that produces 5% of the beef [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=276.0s)]
*  in America. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  JBS can butcher 6,000 cows a day here, but each night the plant was turned over to PSSI [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  for cleaning from 11 to 7 a.m. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=293.2s)]
*  Chanin Rebilleto staked out the parking lot as JBS left and PSSI came in. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=296.4s)]
*  And you really noted the difference in the appearance of these workers that were coming [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=304.76s)]
*  to work this late night shift. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  They were little. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  They looked young. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=314.08s)]
*  She believed children were washing bloody floors and razor sharp machines with scalding [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=316.28s)]
*  water and powerful chemicals. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=321.88s)]
*  So Rebilleto returned with a team and a search warrant. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=324.56s)]
*  She says they found nine children at work, a revelation that triggered a national audit [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=329.24s)]
*  of PSSI. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=335.88s)]
*  And what did you find? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=338.24s)]
*  That this was the standard operating procedure, that there were minors employed across the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=339.92s)]
*  country between the ages of 13 and 17 working the overnight shift. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  This was not a mistake. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=348.44s)]
*  There's no way that this was just a mistake, a clerical error, a handful of rogue individuals [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=349.92s)]
*  getting through. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=355.48s)]
*  This was the standard operating procedure. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=357.24s)]
*  How many minors did you identify? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  We were able to identify and confirm 102 minors at 13 different plants in eight different [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=362.04s)]
*  states. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=370.12s)]
*  Do you believe that 102 is the full extent? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=371.12s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=374.04s)]
*  I believe that the number is likely much higher. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=375.04s)]
*  Last November, the Department of Labor filed suit against PSSI. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=378.24s)]
*  The company responded with this. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=383.42s)]
*  PSSI has an absolute company-wide prohibition against hiring minors. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=385.72s)]
*  It added, we will defend ourselves vigorously against these claims. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=391.68s)]
*  The statement said PSSI checks eligibility of employees, including this girl, on a federal [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=396.92s)]
*  database. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=403.88000000000005s)]
*  But that database is well known to be abused in an industry that can struggle to find workers. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=405.54s)]
*  The jobs are grim and dangerous, and so they are often filled by immigrants who are desperate [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=414.04s)]
*  for work. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=420.16s)]
*  Some immigrants use false papers to routinely beat the federal identification system that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=421.66s)]
*  is known as e-verify. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  Employers have known for nearly 30 years that e-verify is useless if the applicant has bought, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=431.1s)]
*  borrowed, or stolen an actual ID, which is common. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=437.6s)]
*  But in the case of the children, e-verify was especially dubious. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=442.34s)]
*  These weren't close calls. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=448.21999999999997s)]
*  In some cases, there were 13-year-olds working, and they were identified by PSSI as being [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=450.09999999999997s)]
*  in their 30s. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=456.29999999999995s)]
*  Just, it's not possible. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=457.29999999999995s)]
*  In its statement when the suit was filed, PSSI said in addition to e-verify, it has [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=460.14s)]
*  The system that they use automatically flags whether or not someone is certified that they [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=467.82s)]
*  are 18 or not. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=483.9s)]
*  And what we found in our review was that it was regularly ignored if someone didn't [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=485.18s)]
*  certify that they were 18. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=490.34s)]
*  Did any of the children tell you how long they had been working at the plant? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=492.18s)]
*  And how long was that? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=496.54s)]
*  We looked back at a three-year period so we can confirm that they had minors working there [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=498.74s)]
*  as early as 2019. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=504.1s)]
*  Four weeks after its vow to vigorously defend itself, PSSI settled with the government. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=506.90000000000003s)]
*  It did not dispute the finding that it hired children. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=514.2s)]
*  PSSI promised not to do so in the future and agreed to regular audits. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=518.1s)]
*  The company paid the maximum fine of $1.5 million, which was about 1% of its cash on [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=524.0s)]
*  hand. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=532.4000000000001s)]
*  The settlement ended the suit, but it did not answer the question why. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=533.86s)]
*  The children's pay was the same as adults, so why hire kids? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=539.52s)]
*  Jessica Lima gave us insight into this question and into the desperation of the workers. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=545.1600000000001s)]
*  People, I know we need money to survive, to pay bills, to pay rent, but for me it's [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=552.4s)]
*  not. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=560.24s)]
*  We just need a job. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=561.24s)]

*  This seems like this is a game changer for American industry. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1700.02s)]
*  It's a competitive advantage. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1705.72s)]
*  It's an opportunity that we can be a leader globally, and why not lead? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1707.86s)]
*  When Russia invaded Ukraine last year, James Nakwe packed up his cameras and Keblar vest [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1718.78s)]
*  and rushed to the front lines. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1730.66s)]
*  Nakwe is one of the greatest war photographers of all time. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1732.62s)]
*  Over the last four decades, he's covered nearly every armed conflict in the world. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1736.22s)]
*  He was shot in the leg in Thailand, wounded by a bomb in El Salvador, a mortar in Beirut, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1740.6s)]
*  and a grenade in Iraq that was tossed into a Humvee he was riding in. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1745.82s)]
*  James Nakwe is 75 now, and as we found out, trying to keep up with him over the past year, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1749.9399999999998s)]
*  still risking his life to capture images that may be difficult to look at, but important [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1755.1799999999998s)]
*  to never forget. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1760.74s)]
*  In the darkest times and in the most dangerous places, James Nakwe captures beauty and brutality, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1763.62s)]
*  moments of hate and heroism, senseless destruction, and quiet acts of compassion. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1771.62s)]
*  His photographs reveal the deepest and often disturbing depths of who we are and what we [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1779.62s)]
*  do to each other. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1785.34s)]
*  You've said that photographs can speak, and I'm wondering if you feel like you're helping [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1787.1799999999998s)]
*  give voice to some of the people you photograph. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1791.6s)]
*  Well, many of the people I photographed are marginalized by the powers that be, that they're [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1794.1399999999999s)]
*  silenced, they're made invisible. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1801.06s)]
*  So when someone comes from another part of the world and assumes risk to tell their story, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1803.6599999999999s)]
*  I think people see us as a kind of messenger. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1812.26s)]
*  Nakwe has devoted his life to telling other people's stories, bearing witness to their [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1816.78s)]
*  suffering and sacrifices. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1821.02s)]
*  But documenting what he calls the insanity of war has been the core of his career. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1823.58s)]
*  He spent decades covering conflicts in Afghanistan and the Middle East, the war in Bosnia and [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1829.04s)]
*  the genocide in Rwanda, when as many as a million people died. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1835.0s)]
*  Some photographers have talked about their camera as a weapon. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1839.82s)]
*  Do you think of your camera in that way? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1842.08s)]
*  I think it's a way of looking at it, because in a way you might be fighting for peace or [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1843.84s)]
*  fighting against an injustice, and the way you do it is by informing people about it [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1849.42s)]
*  It's the faith that people will want something done about it. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1856.3999999999999s)]
*  In Ukraine at the start of the war, Nakwe worked in and around Kyiv and Kharkiv for [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1860.32s)]
*  the New Yorker magazine. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1864.84s)]
*  These are images he took in Buche shortly after Russian troops pulled out, leaving behind [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1866.84s)]
*  the bodies of civilians they'd executed. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1872.12s)]
*  Buche was horrendous. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1875.1599999999999s)]
*  It was really like kind of butchery. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1877.4399999999998s)]
*  In terms of brutality of all the militaries you have seen, does the Russian military stand [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1880.1799999999998s)]
*  apart in Ukraine for their behavior? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1885.6s)]
*  Somehow the Russians have stood apart not only in Ukraine but in Chechnya. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1888.1999999999998s)]
*  Nakwe was in Chechnya's capital, Grozny, for weeks in 1995 and 96 as Russian forces [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1893.1599999999999s)]
*  relentlessly bombarded the city. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1899.08s)]
*  The part that was inhabited by the Chechens was pounded into rubble from artillery and [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1901.6799999999998s)]
*  rocket fire and airstrikes for weeks and weeks on end with the civilian population trapped [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1907.8s)]
*  inside. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1913.9199999999998s)]
*  They've taken that to Ukraine but it's throughout the country. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1914.96s)]
*  In Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine last year, we watched Nakwe as he worked photographing [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1919.64s)]
*  a man living in a crawl space under a building to avoid shelling. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1924.4s)]
*  Months later, back in his New Hampshire studio, Nakwe showed us some of the images he'd taken. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1929.0s)]
*  What made this an image that spoke to you? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1934.68s)]
*  The expression on his face. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1937.3200000000002s)]
*  If you really look carefully at his eyes, you can see there's terror in his eyes. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1939.4s)]
*  He'd just been living in a state of terror for quite a while. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1944.96s)]
*  This photograph was taken in a Kiev suburb of civilians evacuating across a makeshift [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1949.64s)]
*  bridge. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1954.44s)]
*  These are split seconds that are occurring. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1955.44s)]
*  You can be running and taking a picture. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1958.44s)]
*  Quite often I'm running and I have to try and make a composition, get it in focus and [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1962.64s)]
*  catch the moment. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1967.3600000000001s)]
*  People talk about your use of hands in images. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1969.2s)]
*  Is that something you're conscious of? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1971.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm extremely conscious of hands and eyes. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1973.6000000000001s)]
*  I think those are the two most expressive parts of people. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1976.28s)]
*  This is a really good example here. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1980.0800000000002s)]
*  That's the center of the picture. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1982.8000000000002s)]
*  The old man's hand reaching for support to be held up by the volunteer. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1984.48s)]
*  How many scenes like this have you seen in your life? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1989.8000000000002s)]
*  Too many. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1992.64s)]
*  Decades of Nakwe's photographs are on display in a traveling exhibition called Memoria. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1994.64s)]
*  When it stopped in New York, he showed us some of the 67 stunning images in it. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=1999.76s)]
*  These are the orphanages in Romania. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2004.8400000000001s)]
*  In 1990, Nakwe helped reveal the shocking squalor and neglect in Romania's state-run [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2007.68s)]
*  orphanages. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2012.5200000000002s)]
*  The cribs were just packed together. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2013.88s)]
*  The children were in the cribs and they were taken out to play. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2016.44s)]
*  They were almost like in prison in a way. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2020.0800000000002s)]
*  His photographs, published in the New York Times Magazine, helped lead to an international [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2023.28s)]
*  effort to rescue these children. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2027.68s)]
*  How does a child who's a three years old man have a look like that in his eyes? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2030.08s)]
*  Other walls in the exhibition were lined with casualties of war, a family mourning in Bosnia, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2036.8799999999999s)]
*  a father protecting his wounded daughter from gunfire in El Salvador. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2042.6399999999999s)]
*  Those are machete strikes. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2046.92s)]
*  And this man, a survivor of a machete attack in Rwanda. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2048.36s)]
*  He couldn't talk. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2052.44s)]
*  I approached him very slowly and I just made eye contact with him and I showed him my camera [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2054.12s)]
*  and he allowed me to take the picture. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2060.96s)]
*  Even turned his face more toward the light without me asking. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2063.88s)]
*  That's important to you, that somebody gives their permission in a situation like this. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2067.68s)]
*  I don't want to feel like I'm taking from people. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2072.32s)]
*  I want them to feel like they're part of what I'm doing. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2074.92s)]
*  I think he understood what his scars would say to the rest of the world. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2078.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you get depressed by it? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2083.8s)]
*  Do you cry? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2085.8s)]
*  Do you get angry? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2086.8s)]
*  I'm angry a lot of the time. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2090.68s)]
*  I mean, when I see innocent people being pushed around and bullied, you know, I fight depression. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2094.7200000000003s)]
*  The things are depressing. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2102.84s)]
*  And I think it's a sense of purpose that sort of drives me through that. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2104.48s)]
*  You've said that you had to learn how to channel your anger as a journalist. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2109.04s)]
*  I realize anger can just soar you off the rails. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2113.48s)]
*  So I channel it into the pictures and I think my pictures have anger in them but they also [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2116.88s)]
*  have compassion. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2122.48s)]
*  It was this image and others taken by the legendary Life magazine photographer Larry [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2124.8s)]
*  Burroughs in Vietnam that opened Nakwe's eyes to the power of pictures when he was [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2129.2s)]
*  a student at Dartmouth College in the late 1960s. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2134.3599999999997s)]
*  Burroughs' photographs had a point of view, revealing the reality of war for service members [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2138.04s)]
*  and civilians alike. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2143.04s)]
*  How did you start? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2145.2799999999997s)]
*  I just started called. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2146.3199999999997s)]
*  I read books. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2147.6s)]
*  I would create assignments for myself and I would go out as if I was working for an [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2148.8799999999997s)]
*  editor and practice. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2153.7999999999997s)]
*  Wait, so you would just make up your own assignments? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2155.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2157.56s)]
*  I'm going to go out on a fishing trawler, you know, making believe I was shooting for [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2158.56s)]
*  National Geographic or something. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2162.68s)]
*  He landed a job taking pictures for the Albuquerque Journal in 1976. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2165.2799999999997s)]
*  That's his photo on the front page. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2170.04s)]
*  But it wasn't until 1981, after 10 years of training, that Nakwe felt ready to photograph [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2171.84s)]
*  armed conflict. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2178.0s)]
*  He bought a ticket to Belfast, Northern Ireland, where riots and street battles were escalating. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2179.0s)]
*  Did you know people there? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2184.7599999999998s)]
*  I didn't know anyone. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2186.32s)]
*  I was green. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2187.56s)]
*  I just threw myself into it. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2188.7599999999998s)]
*  His photographs from there were published by Newsweek magazine. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2191.64s)]
*  I felt that I was in the midst of history as it was happening and I was documenting [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2195.16s)]
*  it and that was really an exciting feeling. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2201.24s)]
*  You were on the breaking wave of history. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2204.5s)]
*  I mean, isn't that what photographers do? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2206.16s)]
*  Because nothing's been written. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2208.84s)]
*  A situation is happening. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2210.24s)]
*  We actually don't know what's going to happen in the next moment. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2211.9s)]
*  Anything can happen. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2215.64s)]
*  His unflinching coverage of the civil wars in Central America in the 1980s cemented [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2217.36s)]
*  Nakwe's reputation and earned him a contract with Time magazine, where his work appeared [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2222.0s)]
*  for the next 34 years. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2227.26s)]
*  In South Africa in the early 1990s, Nakwe covered the violent end of apartheid and the [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2229.28s)]
*  blood-soaked birth of a new democracy. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2234.96s)]
*  He was there when another photojournalist, Ken Osterbrook, was shot to death and two [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2238.2400000000002s)]
*  other colleagues wounded. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2242.48s)]
*  We were down on the ground trying to not be targets of incoming fire and you can see [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2244.64s)]
*  my hair part from the bullet going through my hair. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2250.4s)]
*  You actually felt the bullet going through your hair? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2253.8799999999997s)]
*  You could actually see it on the film. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2255.46s)]
*  Here it is again in slow motion. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2258.24s)]
*  As Nakwe in the white shirt moved to reach his injured colleague, a bullet, like a gust [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2260.2s)]
*  of wind, grazed his hair. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2265.04s)]
*  You've come close many times to being killed. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2267.68s)]
*  Is it worth it? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2270.16s)]
*  Where these images? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2271.16s)]
*  It's not for any one image. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2272.24s)]
*  It's for the job itself. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2274.52s)]
*  I decided a long time ago that if I was going to do this, I would have to put myself at [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2276.0s)]
*  risk and anything could happen. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2280.9199999999996s)]
*  You clearly made a commitment that this was worth sacrificing for, worth sacrificing having [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2283.7999999999997s)]
*  a family for. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2288.9599999999996s)]
*  I realized that if I were to pursue what I'm doing, and I was very driven to do that, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2290.2799999999997s)]
*  I wouldn't be a good father. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2298.72s)]
*  I wouldn't be a good husband and all that would fall apart. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2300.24s)]
*  I just didn't want that to happen. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2303.3199999999997s)]
*  So I had to forego it. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2306.12s)]
*  Nakwe lives in Hanover, New Hampshire, where he went to college, though he's rarely there [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2310.7999999999997s)]
*  for long. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2314.9599999999996s)]
*  His life's work, nearly a million images, has been acquired by Dartmouth, including [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2316.3999999999996s)]
*  his wrenching coverage of the opioid epidemic in the U.S. and contact sheets from the morning [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2321.08s)]
*  of September 11th. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2326.3199999999997s)]
*  Nakwe was just blocks away when the towers were hit. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2328.4s)]
*  So that's the first image? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2331.48s)]
*  Yes, that's roll one. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2332.56s)]
*  That's the first picture right there. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2334.04s)]
*  The proof sheets are a silent reminder of the horror that day, but also reveal how Nakwe [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2336.1600000000003s)]
*  works. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2341.4s)]
*  He isn't just a photographer documenting destruction, he's a man in search of meaning. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2342.4s)]
*  About a block and a half from the south tower was a small Roman Catholic church with a cross [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2347.64s)]
*  on the top. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2353.4s)]
*  And I thought that was an interesting way of framing it. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2354.64s)]
*  It somehow indicated the cultural difference between who was being attacked and who was [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2358.0s)]
*  doing the attacking. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2363.8s)]
*  And as I was photographing it, the tower fell. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2365.4s)]
*  That's what's happening right here. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2368.98s)]
*  It starts collapsing as I'm photographing it. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2369.98s)]
*  And all of this debris, these giant girders that must have weighed tons were flying through [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2374.16s)]
*  the air. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2380.08s)]
*  You were about to get killed. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2381.08s)]
*  So I found my way into the lee of a building and it all flew over me. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2382.12s)]
*  Decades of close calls have taken their toll on James Nakwe. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2387.08s)]
*  His hearing is damaged and he has grenade shrapnel in his knees, stomach and face. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2390.92s)]
*  But he has no plans on retiring and still finds reasons to hope in his camera's viewfinder. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2396.2s)]
*  The look of just utter joy. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2402.52s)]
*  As in this image of Nelson Mandela on the eve of his election as South Africa's first [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2405.5s)]
*  black president in 1994. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2410.2s)]
*  This fist in the air, which is a symbol of both triumph and defiance. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2412.72s)]
*  And this one taken two years earlier of South African children playing on a trampoline. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2418.3999999999996s)]
*  What made you take this picture? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2423.7599999999998s)]
*  There's something about the innocence of children that's transcendent. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2424.7599999999998s)]
*  And to bounce on a trampoline, I think that you get to the height of your jump and then [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2429.52s)]
*  for a moment you defy gravity. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2435.9199999999996s)]
*  And I think that's the feeling that I wanted to get in this picture. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2439.64s)]
*  That they're transcending the weight that has been on their society. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2444.12s)]
*  Perhaps in the end, that is what James Nakwe shows us in his work. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2448.48s)]
*  That we are all capable of transcending our circumstances and ourselves. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2452.7999999999997s)]
*  We can commit terrible acts of brutality and barbarism, but also stunning acts of kindness [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2458.24s)]
*  and caring. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2463.7999999999997s)]
*  Are you optimistic about the human species? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2465.08s)]
*  I mean, you see the worst in people. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2468.12s)]
*  I don't know if optimism is exactly the right word, but in these horrible situations, we [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2471.04s)]
*  see everyday citizens doing remarkable things for each other. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2476.64s)]
*  Mothers and fathers are my heroes. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2484.48s)]
*  What they do for their children, how they protect them. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2486.8799999999997s)]
*  Being in places where people have next to nothing, and yet anything they have, they [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2491.24s)]
*  offer to a stranger. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2496.68s)]
*  Those are the things that we all have and that are displayed in the worst situations [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2498.8799999999997s)]
*  that makes me believe in humanity. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2504.16s)]
*  How James Nakwe's photos inspired Anderson Cooper to become a journalist. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2512.48s)]
*  You have been the person who made me interested in wanting to do this line of work. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2517.2799999999997s)]

*  of Dominica, home of a rare population of sperm whales. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2541.44s)]
*  She dives right in for a close-up look at the whales and the effort to protect them [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2546.24s)]
*  by establishing a marine reserve where fishing and other harmful activities are banned. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxDzK_vNX0&t=2551.2799999999997s)]
