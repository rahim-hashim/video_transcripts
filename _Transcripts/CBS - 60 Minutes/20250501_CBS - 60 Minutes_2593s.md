*  it was never shared with the bureau's own field agents or top intelligence officials. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  A lot of people will see this video for the first time and think, how is it remotely possible [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=53.76s)]
*  that it's just coming to light now? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  Could it really have been sitting in an evidence locker room all of these years? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=63.879999999999995s)]

*  pedaling off toward the woods. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=92.67999999999999s)]

*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=113.48s)]
*  Earlier this month, a Trump administration plan to cut the National Institutes of Health [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  budget by more than 40% was leaked to the press. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=129.0s)]
*  The preliminary budget sent shockwaves through the nation's health agency, but also the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=133.24s)]
*  wider scientific community that relies on the NIH to fund research. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=137.92s)]
*  Since January, 1,300 NIH employees have been fired and more than $2 billion in research [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=143.64s)]
*  grants canceled. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  It's all part of the administration's effort to shrink the federal government, an effort [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=152.27999999999997s)]
*  led by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  Tonight, you will hear from an NIH insider about the immediate impact of the cuts on [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=160.32s)]
*  research and patients. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=166.0s)]
*  But we begin with Dr. Francis Collins, the longtime director of the agency. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=168.16s)]
*  He told us why he abruptly left the NIH and why he fears aggressive downsizing could impact [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=173.48s)]
*  the health of Americans for generations. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=179.96s)]
*  When you're talking about medical research, when you're talking about people's lives, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=184.08s)]
*  when you're talking about clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease or cancer that may [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=188.24s)]
*  take three or four years, you can't just go in and decide, I'm going to shut those [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=192.68s)]
*  down and maybe I'll try something else. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  Those are people's lives at risk. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=198.96s)]
*  Dr. Francis Collins spent 32 years at the National Institutes of Health, serving as [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=201.24s)]
*  the agency's director for 12 years under three presidential administrations. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=206.6s)]
*  But he says even he was unprepared for the speed and severity of budget cuts at the NIH. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=211.0s)]
*  Give me a sense of what it was like inside the NIH as these cuts started rolling out. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=218.56s)]
*  Almost immediately after inauguration, there were statements made that you were not allowed, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=224.68s)]
*  for instance, to start any new projects. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=230.24s)]
*  The ability to order supplies was cut off. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  Eventually, it was started back up again, but then they put a $1 limit on what you could [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  order. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=245.96s)]
*  There's not much you can order for $1. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=246.96s)]
*  Today we celebrate a major landmark in biology and medicine. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  Collins joined the NIH in 1993 to lead the Human Genome Project and later directed the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=253.24s)]
*  agency's development of new tests, therapeutics and vaccines during the pandemic. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=259.16s)]
*  Still, he says, even after COVID, most people don't know what the NIH does. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=264.88s)]
*  The National Institutes of Health, NIH, is the largest supporter of biomedical research [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=270.8s)]
*  in the world. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=275.48s)]
*  What are some of the medical breakthroughs that people might not be aware of that came [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=276.48s)]
*  through the NIH? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=280.12s)]
*  Deaths from heart disease are down by 75 percent in the last 40 years. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=281.56s)]
*  That's NIH. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=286.76s)]
*  Deaths from stroke are down about 75 percent. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=287.76s)]
*  That's NIH. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=290.76s)]
*  HIV, AIDS, where that was a death sentence, now if you have access to those antiretrovirals, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=291.76s)]
*  NIH and drug companies came up with that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=298.64000000000004s)]
*  You have a normal lifespan. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  The NIH is headquartered on this sprawling 300-acre campus in Bethesda, Maryland. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=304.08s)]
*  It's home to the largest clinical research hospital in the world and 27 research institutes [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=309.68s)]
*  and centers. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  The leaked budget draft includes a plan to consolidate those 27 institutes and centers [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=317.64s)]
*  into eight and eliminate four, including the Institutes on Nursing Research and Minority [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=323.44s)]
*  Health. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=329.32s)]
*  If approved by Congress, it would be the largest budget cut by an administration to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=331.04s)]
*  the health agency, but not the first. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=335.68s)]
*  Most recently, Presidents Bush and Obama made smaller cuts to the NIH, which currently has [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=338.56s)]
*  a $47 billion budget. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=344.76000000000005s)]
*  But Collins says the bulk of that budget, more than 80 percent, goes to researchers [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=348.16s)]
*  off campus. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=353.44s)]
*  Most of that goes out to the universities and institutes all over the country. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=355.0s)]
*  They're the ones that do the work, but they get the funds from NIH by writing very compelling [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=359.24s)]
*  grant applications that go through the most rigorous peer review system in the world. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=364.4s)]
*  Some of those researchers' work lines America's medicine cabinets, such as statins, antidepressants, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=369.84s)]
*  and new forms of insulin. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=375.88s)]
*  A Journal of the American Medical Association study found that between 2010 and 2019, 99 [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  percent of FDA-approved drugs had ties to research funded by the NIH. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=385.88s)]
*  Every dollar that NIH gave out in 2024 to a grant is estimated to have returned $2.46 [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  just in a year. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=400.88s)]
*  That's a pretty darn good return on investment. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=402.08s)]
*  But not good enough to escape the crosshairs of the Trump administration's sweeping budget [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=405.08s)]
*  cuts. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  In February, Dr. Collins decided to leave the NIH. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=410.76s)]
*  It just became untenable. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=415.36s)]
*  I was, as every other scientist in that circumstance, not allowed to speak in any kind of scientific [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=417.6s)]
*  meeting or public setting. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=425.44s)]
*  You don't think if you would have stayed there you would have been in a better position to [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=427.04s)]
*  fight for the scientists and the work? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=430.2s)]
*  I don't think it would have helped. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=433.44s)]
*  I would have been pretty much in a circumstance of not being able to speak about it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=434.8s)]
*  We innovate together! [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  We innovate together! [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  With the exception of a series of rallies, most scientists connected to the NIH have [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=445.08s)]
*  remained quiet. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=450.09999999999997s)]
*  Some, like this physician-scientist who still works at the agency, fear their jobs or research [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  may be targeted for speaking up. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=458.02s)]
*  He asked us to conceal his identity. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=460.74s)]
*  I've never seen the morale of an institution or any place change so abruptly to where we [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=463.12s)]
*  feel fear. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=469.91999999999996s)]
*  It began, he says, in February, when more than a thousand probationary employees were [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=471.36s)]
*  placed on leave. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=476.04s)]
*  When that happened, that first hit, what was the reaction like immediately and in the office [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=477.76s)]
*  the next Monday? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=483.20000000000005s)]
*  Tears. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=484.44s)]
*  Everybody trying to assess damage, who's been fired, who hasn't been fired, what do we do? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=485.44s)]
*  And then an immediate sort of assessment in the clinical center, okay, can we still take [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=491.04s)]
*  care of patients and our research participants? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=495.78000000000003s)]
*  Is it still safe? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=499.16s)]
*  No one thought before they fired the people that dealt with the patients that maybe they [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=500.52000000000004s)]
*  shouldn't be fired? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  This didn't come from within NIH, it came from outside. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=506.68s)]

*  During a raid on Beyoumi's U.K. apartment about 10 days after the attacks, British police [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1126.5s)]
*  discovered the Capitol video, along with about 80 other tapes and a trove of documents now [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1131.96s)]
*  being used as evidence in the family's lawsuit. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1138.24s)]
*  This internal FBI report, dated October 11, 2001, shows that copies of all recovered exhibits [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1141.72s)]
*  were sent to FBI New York via Federal Express, but the Capitol video never made it to the [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1149.0400000000002s)]
*  San Diego field office. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1154.96s)]
*  I had not seen that video. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1156.92s)]
*  Retired FBI Special Agent Danny Gonzalez, one of the lead 9-11 investigators in San [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1158.8400000000001s)]

*  He is also a consultant for the 9-11 family's lawsuit. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1170.72s)]
*  Not only did I not know, all of the case agents in San Diego didn't know, and the case agents [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1174.48s)]
*  in New York didn't know. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1181.48s)]
*  And we're talking about the Joint Terrorism Task Forces that not only have FBI, but we [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1183.24s)]
*  have other state, local, and federal agencies. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1187.56s)]
*  They did not know either. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1190.08s)]
*  How's that possible? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1191.72s)]
*  I don't have that answer, and that angers me. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1193.28s)]
*  When I saw that video, I knew exactly what it was. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1195.8799999999999s)]
*  Did you need this information to do your job? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1199.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1202.08s)]
*  He believes he could have used the Capitol video to build a case against Bayoumi. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1203.16s)]
*  I would have taken it to the United States Attorney's Office, who was requesting from [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1207.6399999999999s)]
*  us, the FBI, anything that we had they wanted to look at. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1212.6399999999999s)]
*  Meaning what? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1217.16s)]
*  That they would have filed charges, that they would have indicted? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1218.16s)]
*  What would you hope in that be? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1221.22s)]
*  It was a terror investigation, but it was also a mass murder. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1222.22s)]
*  In your view, this video was so significant that it should have gone all the way to the [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1225.34s)]
*  top to the White House. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1230.74s)]
*  I think it should have because it's the Capitol building. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1232.3s)]
*  Gina Bennett was a senior counterterrorism analyst at the CIA for 20 years. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1235.14s)]
*  In the aftermath of 9-11, we were briefing the president and the National Security Council. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1240.58s)]
*  We didn't expect that this was a one and done. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1246.68s)]
*  We expected Al Qaeda to continue to try. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1250.04s)]
*  So resources were going entirely to trying to undermine any additional plotting. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1253.1599999999999s)]
*  The Saudi government says this is a tourist video, that there's nothing to see here. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1258.46s)]
*  You don't buy that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1262.2s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1263.2s)]
*  Who does a tourist video that is reporting back on this is where that building is and [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1264.2s)]
*  here's where the security guards are? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1269.78s)]
*  Now retired, she was the first person in the U.S. government to warn of the dangers of [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1271.86s)]
*  a global jihadist movement led by Osama bin Laden. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1276.46s)]
*  Bennett has no involvement with the 9-11 family's lawsuit and says she too was unaware of the [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1280.44s)]
*  video's existence until we asked her to evaluate it. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1285.92s)]
*  As we discovered, she was not the only one at the CIA in the dark. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1289.96s)]
*  George Tenet, the CIA director at the time, says he wasn't aware of the video. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1294.32s)]
*  Same for Michael Morell, the president's daily intelligence briefer at the time. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1298.0s)]
*  Does it surprise you that they didn't know about this? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1302.28s)]
*  It does surprise me again because we're talking about the U.S. Capitol and in the immediate [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1305.08s)]
*  aftermath of 9-11, Bayoumi was a suspect. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1310.3799999999999s)]
*  A lot of people will see this video for the first time and think, how is it remotely possible [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1313.74s)]
*  that it's just coming to light now? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1322.22s)]
*  Could it really have been sitting in an evidence locker room all of these years? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1324.76s)]
*  It seems like a pretty epic failure. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1329.62s)]
*  I think it's a matter of did they lose the evidence or had they filed it away in a way [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1331.98s)]
*  that it would not have seemed relevant. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1336.76s)]
*  That I can see. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1339.98s)]
*  As it turns out, there was more evidence. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1341.38s)]
*  Specifically, this airplane sketch and math formula that was also seized from Bayoumi's [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1344.38s)]
*  U.K. apartment and turned over to the FBI in 2001. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1349.78s)]
*  It was stashed away for more than a decade until Danny Gonzalez in 2012 got a phone call [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1354.38s)]
*  out of the blue from an FBI evidence technician in Washington. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1360.6s)]
*  What did they tell you? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1365.0s)]
*  They told me that they had these boxes with the name of Omar Al Bayoumi written on it [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1366.0s)]
*  and they were sitting in a warehouse in Washington, D.C. and they were going to relocate these [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1371.02s)]
*  boxes or destroy these boxes and they wanted to know if I wanted them and I said absolutely. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1375.52s)]
*  But as one of the lead investigators into these attacks, did you have any idea that [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1381.12s)]
*  this sketch had even existed before you got that phone call? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1386.6999999999998s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1390.08s)]
*  He had aviation and aerospace experts analyze the equation for the FBI. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1391.28s)]
*  Their conclusion? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1396.68s)]
*  A pilot could use it to calculate the rate of descent to hit a target on the horizon. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1397.68s)]
*  In 2004, the 9-11 Commission produced what was at the time considered the definitive [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1403.16s)]
*  account of the attacks. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1409.56s)]
*  Its executive director, Philip Zelikow, told us he was also unaware of it during his investigation. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1411.62s)]
*  So were former senior U.S. intelligence officials we spoke to. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1418.76s)]
*  As for Bayoumi, who was never charged with the crime and moved back to Saudi Arabia after [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1423.16s)]
*  9-11, he was asked about the sketch as part of the lawsuit in a 2021 deposition. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1428.28s)]
*  He confirmed the sketch was his but said he remembered little else about it, including [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1435.26s)]
*  his handwritten notes that say, height of the plane from the earth in mile and distance [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1440.2s)]
*  from the plane to horizon. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1445.6s)]
*  Impressed about it, he came up with a far-fetched explanation. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1447.82s)]
*  Perhaps this was an equation that we studied before in high school and I was trying to [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1451.86s)]
*  remember whether I'm going to be able to figure out and solve it or not. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1457.82s)]
*  And what is an equation for? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1461.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1463.6599999999999s)]
*  Just matter. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1464.6599999999999s)]
*  Just an equation. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1465.6599999999999s)]
*  There's no proof that Bayoumi shared the equation with any of the hijackers. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1468.54s)]
*  What we do know is that he met the first two to arrive in the U.S. nearly two years [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1472.86s)]
*  before 9-11. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1477.9399999999998s)]
*  Bayoumi claims he met them in a chance encounter at a restaurant here on Venice Boulevard in [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1480.62s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1485.5s)]
*  He then helped them move to San Diego, finding them a place to live in his own apartment [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1486.9199999999998s)]
*  complex, co-signing the lease and helping them open a bank account. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1491.86s)]
*  He even threw a party, which he also videotaped, capturing one of the hijackers on camera. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1497.24s)]
*  He then introduced them to others who helped them obtain government IDs and enroll in English [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1503.58s)]
*  classes and flight schools. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1509.22s)]
*  Bayoumi and the Saudi government say his actions were innocent, the result of a remarkable [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1511.54s)]
*  series of coincidences. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1516.62s)]
*  Isn't it all possible in your mind that Bayoumi wasn't actually involved in all of this is [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1519.06s)]
*  pure coincidence as the Saudis claim? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1524.8799999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1527.34s)]
*  No. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1528.34s)]
*  I don't believe that for a second. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1529.34s)]
*  Why not? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1530.34s)]
*  The guy who just wanted to help his brothers adjust to a life in a new country? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1531.34s)]
*  Who else did he help besides those two hijackers? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1536.26s)]
*  I don't know of any and I couldn't find any. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1538.78s)]
*  Omar al-Bayoumi is living as a free man in Saudi Arabia. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1541.1799999999998s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1545.86s)]
*  Awful. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1547.1399999999999s)]
*  Awful. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1548.1399999999999s)]
*  He should be here under the court system. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1549.1399999999999s)]
*  The 9-11 Commission concluded that Bayoumi was, quote, an unlikely candidate for clandestine [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1551.06s)]
*  involvement with Islamist extremists. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1556.54s)]
*  Does that still hold? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1559.4599999999998s)]
*  I think the 9-11 Commission is just not fully informed. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1560.58s)]
*  It's not their fault, but it's not fully informed. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1565.1399999999999s)]
*  So all the evidence you've seen, the material support, the capital video, the sketch, your [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1568.26s)]
*  conclusion is what? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1574.3799999999999s)]
*  My conclusion is that Bayoumi was an al-Qaeda facilitator. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1576.06s)]
*  He had sympathies with al-Qaeda, I mean, ideologically, and that he provided substantial support to [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1582.3s)]
*  these two individuals, these two hijackers, without which they may very well have been [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1589.54s)]
*  caught. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1594.5s)]
*  Menit says Bayoumi was indispensable to the success of the hijackers' plot because they [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1595.5s)]
*  spoke no English, had little formal education, and no prior exposure to life in the West. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1601.02s)]
*  I don't see al-Qaeda as meticulous as it was with its planning, just throwing two operatives [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1607.5s)]
*  that are so instrumental to the success of this operation into a massive city without [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1615.92s)]
*  a soft landing, without a network there to catch them. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=1623.2s)]

*  Is it working? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2192.14s)]
*  Yes, it's working. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2193.14s)]
*  And number of applications is more than we expected, three or four times. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2194.9s)]
*  Tokyo is also set to introduce a four-day work week for government employees, designed [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2201.58s)]
*  to help working mothers and, hopefully, boost birth rates. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2206.46s)]
*  When the bubble economy was boosting, there was a commercial advertisement, work 24 hours. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2210.54s)]
*  But the longer we work, the less children we have. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2218.22s)]
*  So demography is one of the biggest national issues that we have to tackle. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2223.66s)]
*  The Japanese government has rolled out a number of programs to address this declining birth [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2231.22s)]
*  rate. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2235.54s)]
*  Are any of them working? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2236.66s)]
*  The total fertility rate for 2024 was reported to hit an all-time low. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2238.98s)]
*  The continuing slide in the birth rate clearly indicates our current policy isn't working [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2243.86s)]
*  at all. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2248.02s)]
*  Until last year, Hanako Okada, now 44, was a lawyer in Tokyo and primary caregiver for [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2250.5s)]
*  her two children. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2256.34s)]
*  Overworked and under-fulfilled, she ran for parliament on a platform of trying to alter [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2258.66s)]
*  the culture for women, even breaking down in tears on the campaign trail describing [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2263.02s)]
*  her stress. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2267.74s)]
*  I remembered how tough it was to raise my child and I burst into tears. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2271.2999999999997s)]
*  It was overwhelming. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2275.54s)]
*  And viewers probably thought, I'm a politician who gets what ordinary people have to deal [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2277.3399999999997s)]
*  with. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2281.66s)]
*  It was effective. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2282.66s)]
*  She won unexpectedly. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2284.54s)]
*  And Hanasan, as she's called, is now something of a political change agent. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2286.5s)]
*  She says confronting the population problem requires not dating apps and shortened work [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2291.02s)]
*  weeks, but a sweeping mindset change. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2295.66s)]
*  In particular, a rethinking of living in urban areas, as 92 percent of Japanese currently [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2298.46s)]
*  do. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2304.98s)]
*  She practiced what she preaches, moving back to her rural hometown of Aomori, a northern [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2306.7799999999997s)]
*  prefecture known for its apple orchards, but one that is rapidly aging, rapidly losing [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2312.18s)]
*  people. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2318.06s)]
*  Although it was built for 600 students, this Aomori middle school is now only one-third [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2320.34s)]
*  filled. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2325.98s)]
*  They still learn the traditional shamisen. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2326.98s)]
*  But there are too few kids to field a soccer team, and a competitive snowball fight means [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2331.82s)]
*  recruiting a visiting ringer. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2336.7400000000002s)]
*  Why'd you return? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2339.1400000000003s)]
*  Aomori is my hometown. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2342.94s)]
*  The precipitous drop in population and vitality of this city is deeply troubling, not just [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2344.5s)]
*  personally but from a national perspective. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2349.94s)]
*  If our regions collapse, it imperils our country's strength. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2352.62s)]
*  I thought we can't allow the situation to go on. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2356.02s)]
*  You've seen the math, I'm sure. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2359.26s)]
*  Do you believe Japan can overcome this population crisis? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2361.3s)]
*  We need to stop the over-concentration of people in Tokyo. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2366.26s)]
*  In the rural areas, we need interesting jobs with decent pay that allow young people to [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2369.54s)]
*  support themselves. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2374.26s)]
*  Her thinking? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2376.78s)]
*  Once there are more jobs in rural areas, the younger people will come. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2378.34s)]
*  Once they come and experience the space, the slower rhythms, the quality of life, they'll [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2382.26s)]
*  be motivated to start families. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2386.98s)]
*  The values of our younger generation are gradually shifting. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2390.1800000000003s)]
*  Tokyo is no longer the be-all and all. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2393.5800000000004s)]
*  One such Japanese family that agrees, the Kato's. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2397.76s)]
*  They recently exchanged city life for this spacious house in Ichinono, land of puppets. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2400.98s)]
*  Their son Kornosuke was the first baby born in the village in more than 20 years. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2408.26s)]
*  We've got a mountain and a river to explore. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2415.62s)]
*  We make our own toys and grow our own vegetables. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2418.1s)]
*  For a kid, there's plenty of ways to have fun here. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2420.9s)]
*  You're happy here? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2423.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2425.98s)]
*  I truly enjoy this lifestyle. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2427.98s)]
*  The Kato's hope, others will follow, that Kornosuke will have friends and classmates [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2430.82s)]
*  among all the town's dolls. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2435.7400000000002s)]

*  I want Japanese people to become more aware of this lifestyle, which is closer to our [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2440.7400000000002s)]
*  traditional way of living. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2445.1400000000003s)]
*  It might be a traditional Japanese lifestyle, but amid a population decline, it will be [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2447.78s)]
*  in a smaller, lonelier, and fundamentally different Japan. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2452.86s)]
*  The historically low birth rate in the United States. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2460.82s)]

*  In tonight's Last Minute, a note on Bill Owens, who until this past week was executive [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2487.7799999999997s)]
*  producer of 60 Minutes. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2493.9399999999996s)]
*  He was our boss. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2496.2599999999998s)]
*  Bill was with CBS News nearly 40 years, 26 years at 60 Minutes. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2498.2599999999998s)]
*  He covered the world, covered combat, the White House. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2503.7s)]
*  His was a quest to open minds, not close them. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2507.7799999999997s)]
*  If you've ever worked hard for a boss because you admired him, then you understand what [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2512.34s)]
*  we've enjoyed here. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2517.86s)]
*  Bill resigned Tuesday. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2520.2200000000003s)]
*  It was hard on him and hard on us. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2521.96s)]
*  But he did it for us and you. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2524.82s)]
*  Stories we've pursued for 57 years are often controversial. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2528.46s)]
*  Lately, the Israel-Gaza war and the Trump administration. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2532.1400000000003s)]
*  Bill made sure they were accurate and fair. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2537.2000000000003s)]
*  He was tough that way. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2539.5s)]
*  But our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2541.68s)]
*  The Trump administration must approve it. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2546.2s)]
*  Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2549.04s)]
*  None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2554.44s)]
*  journalism requires. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2560.72s)]
*  No one here is happy about it. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv_5PPRuk_M&t=2563.2s)]
