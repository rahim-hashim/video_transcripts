# Targeting Americans; Kevin Hart | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8)
*  A car chase in Florida may have provided the vital clue to a national security mystery. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=0.0s)]
*  Many U.S. officials and their families believe they've been injured by a secret weapon in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=19.76s)]
*  the hands of a foreign adversary. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=25.52s)]
*  It's devastating. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  It's absolutely devastating. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=29.96s)]
*  Tonight we have evidence of who might be responsible. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=31.8s)]
*  Are we being attacked? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=36.24s)]
*  My personal opinion, yes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=38.04s)]
*  By whom? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=39.8s)]
*  Russia. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=40.8s)]
*  The wall is full of great comedians. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=43.68s)]
*  Kevin Hart is a comedian. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=46.0s)]
*  I've been five-five my whole life, five-four, five-two and a half. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=47.56s)]
*  A movie star. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  And as you'll hear tonight, a budding tycoon. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=54.44s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=57.32s)]
*  Are you a billionaire yet? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=58.92s)]
*  None of your business. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=59.92s)]
*  You trying to give me ride? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=60.92s)]
*  Trying to give me knock to my head? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=61.92s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=67.04s)]

*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=75.0s)]
*  Those stories tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  Tonight we have important developments in our five-year investigation of mysterious [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=87.96s)]
*  brain injuries reported by U.S. national security officials. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=93.36s)]
*  The injured include White House staff, CIA officers, FBI agents, military officers, and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=98.61999999999999s)]
*  their families. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=105.32s)]
*  Many believe that they were wounded by a secret weapon that fires a high-energy beam of microwaves [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=106.96s)]
*  or ultrasound. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  This is our fourth story, and as we reported in March, we now have evidence of who might [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=116.16s)]
*  be responsible. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=123.28s)]
*  Most of the injured have fought for America, often in secret, and they're frustrated that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=125.56s)]
*  the U.S. government publicly doubts that an adversary is targeting Americans. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=130.88s)]
*  One of them is Carrie. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=138.92s)]
*  They're disguising her and not using her last name because she's still an FBI agent working [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=141.08s)]
*  in counterintelligence. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=147.0s)]
*  She says in 2021 she was home in Florida when she was hit by a crippling force. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=149.32s)]
*  And bam, inside my right ear it was like a dentist drilling on steroids. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=155.8s)]
*  That feeling when it gets too close to your eardrum, it's like that, you know, times [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=162.6s)]
*  10. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=168.48s)]
*  It was like a high-pitched metallic drilling noise, and it knocked me forward at like a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=169.48s)]
*  45-degree angle this way. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=174.32s)]
*  She says she was by a window in her laundry room. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=176.42s)]
*  My right ear was line of sight to that window while this thing was happening in my ear. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=180.04s)]
*  And when I leaned forward, it kind of knocked, it didn't knock me over, but it knocked me [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  forward. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  I immediately felt pressure, and pressure and pain started coursing from inside my right [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  ear, down my jaw, down my neck, and into my chest. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=196.48s)]
*  At the same time, FBI agent Carrie told us the battery in her phone began to swell until [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=201.16s)]
*  it broke the case. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=208.29999999999998s)]
*  Finally, she passed out on a couch. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=210.12s)]
*  Because of chest pain, she was checked by a cardiologist and then returned to duty. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=214.04s)]
*  And I remember complaining to my colleagues for months after that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=219.56s)]
*  I felt like I had early Alzheimer's. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=224.92s)]
*  Short-term memory, long-term memory, confusing memories, multitasking. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=226.92s)]
*  My baseline changed. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=232.56s)]
*  I was not the same person. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=233.56s)]
*  Carrie's story matches those we've uncovered over the years. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=235.88s)]
*  It was like this piercing feeling on the side of my head. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=239.88s)]
*  It was like, I remember it was on the right side of my head, and I got like vertigo. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=244.32s)]
*  Olivia Troy was Homeland Security advisor to Vice President Mike Pence. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=249.56s)]
*  In our 2022 report, she told us she was hit outside the White House. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=254.88s)]
*  And then severe ear pain started. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=260.8s)]
*  So I liken it to if you put a Q-tip too far and you bounce off your eardrum, well, imagine [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=262.7s)]
*  taking a sharp pencil and just kind of poke in that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=266.48s)]
*  And this man told us he was among the first publicly known cases in 2016 from our embassy [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=269.24s)]
*  in Cuba. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=276.58s)]
*  That's how the incidents became known as Havana syndrome. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=277.74s)]
*  He's medically retired from an agency we can't name, blind in one eye and struggling for [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=282.7s)]
*  balance. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=290.18s)]
*  What we're hearing about now is... [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=291.18s)]
*  A major medical study for the government was led by Dr. David Railman of Stanford University. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=292.41999999999996s)]
*  In our 2022 report, he told us... [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=299.86s)]
*  What we found was, we thought, clear evidence of an injury to the auditory and vestibular [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=302.66s)]
*  system of the brain. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=310.1s)]
*  Everything starting with the inner ear, where humans perceive sound and sense balance, and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=312.16s)]
*  then translate those perceptions into brain electrical signals. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=321.46000000000004s)]
*  His study found directed pulsed radio frequency energy appears to be the most plausible mechanism. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=328.76s)]
*  For example, a focused beam of microwaves or acoustic ultrasound. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=337.32s)]
*  More than 100 officials or family members have unexplained persistent symptoms. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=344.12s)]
*  If I turn too fast, my gyroscope is off, essentially. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=350.84s)]
*  It's like a step behind where I'm supposed to be. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=353.44s)]
*  So I'll turn too fast and I will literally walk right into the wall or the door frame. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=355.6s)]
*  Now, for the first time, the case of FBI agent Kerry suggests which adversary might be responsible. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=359.92s)]
*  She spoke with the FBI's permission, but wasn't allowed to discuss the cases she was on when [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=368.92s)]
*  she was hit. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=374.90000000000003s)]
*  We have learned, from other sources, one of those cases involved this Mustang. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=376.56s)]
*  Running 110 miles an hour. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=384.56s)]
*  Pull over! [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=387.48s)]
*  Pull over! [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=389.44s)]
*  In 2020, near Key West, Florida, deputies tried to stop the Mustang for speeding. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=391.04s)]
*  It ran 15 miles until it hit spike strips laid in its path. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=397.04s)]
*  Get up and go! [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=402.96s)]
*  Get up and go! [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=406.35999999999996s)]
*  A search of the car found notes of bank accounts. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  City bank, discover savings, 75,000. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  And this device that looks like a walkie-talkie can erase the car's computer data, including [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=425.0s)]
*  its GPS record. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=431.44s)]
*  There was also a Russian passport. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=433.68s)]
*  What's your first name? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  Vitaly. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  B-I-T-A-L-I-I. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  Vitaly Kovalev was the driver from St. Petersburg, Russia, not Florida. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  Why did you run? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=446.88s)]
*  Let me be honest with you. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=447.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=448.88s)]
*  You don't know why you ran? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=449.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=450.88s)]
*  And we don't know why he ran, but what we learned suggests he was a Russian spy. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=451.88s)]
*  What we see here is Vitaly Kovalev fitting exactly this formula. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=457.2s)]
*  Christo Grozev is a journalist legendary for unmasking Russian plots. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=462.4s)]
*  In 2020, he uncovered the names of the Russian secret agents who poisoned Vladimir Putin's [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=468.28s)]
*  rival Alexei Navalny. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=474.28s)]
*  Grozev is lead investigator for our collaborator on this story, The Insider, a magazine by [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=477.47999999999996s)]
*  Russian exiles. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=484.38s)]
*  We asked him to trace Vitaly Kovalev. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=486.78s)]
*  He studied in a military institute. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=490.56s)]
*  He studied radio electronics with a particular focus on use within the military of microelectronics. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=492.56s)]
*  He had all the technology know-how that would be required for somebody to be assisting an [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=501.24s)]
*  operation that requires high technology. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=506.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, after working for two years in a military institute, he up and [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=508.48s)]
*  decides to become a chef. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=513.84s)]
*  Kovalev immigrated to the U.S. and worked as a chef in New York and Washington, D.C., [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=517.36s)]
*  even appearing at far left in a TV cooking segment. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=524.28s)]
*  Traditional Russian recipes, thanks to our wonderful chef. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=529.0799999999999s)]
*  But Kovalev was actually a Russian military electrical engineer with a top secret security [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=532.8s)]

*  My personal opinion, yes. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=824.6s)]
*  By whom? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=826.34s)]
*  Russia. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=827.64s)]
*  Greg Edgreen ran the investigation for the Defense Intelligence Agency. He would not [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=829.32s)]
*  discuss classified information, but he described his team's work from 2021 to 2023. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=834.7600000000001s)]

*  open source reporting, anything regarding the internet, travel records, financial records, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=850.1600000000001s)]

*  I can tell you at a very early stage I started to focus on Moscow. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=861.96s)]
*  Can you tell me about the patterns you began to see? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=867.08s)]
*  One of the things I started to notice was the caliber of our officer that was being [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=871.72s)]
*  impacted. This wasn't happening to our worst or our middle range officers. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=879.4000000000001s)]
*  This was happening to our top five, 10% performing officers across the Defense Intelligence Agency. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=887.4000000000001s)]
*  And consistently there was a Russia nexus. There was some angle where they had worked [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=894.8000000000001s)]
*  against Russia, focused on Russia, and done extremely well. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=900.7600000000001s)]
*  What has been the impact on American national security? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=905.12s)]
*  The impact has been that the intelligence officers and our diplomats working abroad [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=909.44s)]
*  are being removed from their posts with traumatic brain injuries. They're being neutralized. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=916.48s)]
*  We have learned of an incident at last year's NATO summit in Lithuania, a meeting that focused [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=922.0400000000001s)]
*  largely on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and was attended by President Biden. Multiple [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=929.12s)]
*  sources tell us that a senior official of the Department of Defense was struck by the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=935.7600000000001s)]
*  symptoms and sought medical treatment. We told Greg Edgreen what we had learned. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=941.5s)]
*  It tells me that there are no barriers on what Moscow will do, on who they will attack, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=948.2800000000001s)]
*  and that if we don't face this head on, the problem is going to get worse. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=955.1s)]
*  The problem first appeared in public in 2016. U.S. officials reported being hurt in Cuba [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=959.82s)]
*  and the incidents became known as Havana Syndrome. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=967.1800000000001s)]
*  But we have learned it started two years earlier, when at least four Americans reported symptoms [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=971.34s)]
*  in Frankfurt, Germany. There is also evidence of what could be revenge attacks. For example, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=979.1400000000001s)]
*  in 2014, three CIA officers were stationed in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin's obsession. 2014, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=987.62s)]
*  was the year that a popular revolt overthrew Putin's preferred leader. Later, those CIA [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=997.0600000000001s)]
*  officers went on to other assignments and reported being hit, one in Uzbekistan, one [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1004.7800000000001s)]
*  in Vietnam, and the third officer's family was hit in London. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1011.5s)]
*  If it is Russia, investigative reporter Kristo Grozev believes he knows who's involved. In [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1018.1800000000001s)]
*  2018, Grozev was the first to discover the existence of a top secret Russian intelligence [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1025.18s)]
*  unit which goes by a number, 29155. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1031.98s)]
*  These are people who are trained to be versatile assassins and sabotage operators. They are [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1037.78s)]
*  trained in counter surveillance, they are trained in explosives, they are trained in [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1043.78s)]
*  using poison and technology equipment actually inflict pain or damage to the targets. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1047.22s)]
*  Grozev works with our collaborators on this report, a magazine called The Insider and [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1055.66s)]
*  Germany's Der Spiegel. He has a long track record uncovering Russian documents, and Grozev [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1061.6200000000001s)]
*  says he found one that may link 29155 to a directed energy weapon. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1068.78s)]
*  And when I saw it, I literally had tears in my eyes because it was spelling out what they [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1076.74s)]
*  had been doing. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1081.24s)]
*  As a piece of accounting, an officer of 29155 received a bonus for work on, quote, potential [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1082.74s)]
*  capabilities of non-lethal acoustic weapons. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1091.82s)]

*  tests of a directed energy unit. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1102.66s)]

*  Grozev found Albert Avarianov's phone was turned off during the Tbilisi incidents, but [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1272.14s)]
*  our sources say there is evidence someone in Tbilisi logged into Avarianov's personal [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1278.78s)]
*  email during this time. Most likely Grozev believes Avarianov himself, placing him in [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1285.98s)]
*  the city. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1293.58s)]
*  We believe members of unit 255 were there in order to facilitate, supervise or maybe [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1294.66s)]
*  even personally implement attacks on American diplomats and American government officials [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1300.34s)]

*  husband, what did you do then? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1312.78s)]
*  I went downstairs. I first looked on our security camera, which is right beside our front door, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1315.18s)]
*  to see if anyone was outside. There was a vehicle right outside of our gate. I took [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1320.8600000000001s)]
*  a photo of that vehicle and noticed that it was not a vehicle that I recognized and I [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1327.18s)]
*  went outside. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1333.14s)]
*  Did you see anyone around the vehicle? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1334.74s)]
*  I did. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1336.5800000000002s)]
*  We sent you a photograph of Albert Avarianov and this is the picture that you have. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1337.8600000000001s)]
*  The picture that we sent you. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1345.18s)]
*  You did. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1346.78s)]
*  And I wonder if that looks anything like the man you saw outside your home. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1347.46s)]
*  It absolutely does. And when I received this photo, I had a visceral reaction. It made [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1352.18s)]
*  me feel sick. I cannot absolutely say for certainty that it is this man, but I can tell [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1360.22s)]
*  you that even to this day, looking at him makes me feel that same visceral reaction [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1368.22s)]
*  and I can absolutely say that this looks like the man that I saw in the street. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1378.82s)]
*  This 40-year-old wife and mother is among the most severely injured people we have met. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1385.82s)]
*  My headaches and brain fog continued. Later on into that weekend, I started having trouble [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1392.82s)]
*  walking down the stairs, specifically at night. I had trouble finding the steps to get down [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1401.3799999999999s)]
*  the stairs. So my coordination and vestibular system started just really falling apart. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1406.54s)]
*  She was medically evacuated and now doctors say she has holes in her inner ear canals. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1414.4199999999998s)]
*  The vestibular system that creates the sense of balance. Two surgeries put metal plates [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1421.42s)]
*  in her skull. Another surgery is likely. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1428.5800000000002s)]
*  It's devastating. It's absolutely devastating. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1433.18s)]
*  Despite experiences like hers, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1438.94s)]
*  last year, it's very unlikely a foreign adversary is responsible. But the DNI also [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1444.24s)]
*  acknowledged some intelligence agencies had only low or moderate confidence in that assessment. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1451.12s)]
*  Recently the National Institutes of Health reported results of brain scans on some patients. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1458.76s)]
*  NIH said there's no evidence of physical damage. But the medical science of so-called [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1465.6s)]
*  anomalous health incidents remains vigorously debated. For its part, the Director of National [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1472.3999999999999s)]
*  Intelligence says the symptoms probably result from pre-existing conditions, conventional [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1479.92s)]
*  illnesses and environmental factors. Attorney Mark Zaid represents more than two dozen AHI [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1486.28s)]
*  clients. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1494.4s)]
*  What do you make of the intelligence community assessment? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1495.48s)]
*  So I've had access to classified information relating to AHI. I can't reveal it. I wouldn't [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1498.72s)]
*  reveal it. I will tell you that I don't believe it to be the entire story. And I know of information [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1505.0s)]
*  that undermines or contradicts what they are saying publicly. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1513.44s)]
*  Are you saying that the government wants to cover this up? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1519.6s)]
*  There is, in my view, without a doubt, evidence of a cover-up. Now some of that cover-up is [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1523.72s)]
*  not necessarily that, oh, we found a weapon and we don't want anybody to know about it. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1529.6399999999999s)]
*  What I've seen more so is we see lines of inquiry that would take us potentially to [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1536.3999999999999s)]
*  answers we don't want to have to deal with. So we're not going to explore any of those [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1546.04s)]
*  avenues. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1553.4399999999998s)]
*  You know, if my mother had seen what I saw, she would say it's the Russians, stupid. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1554.32s)]
*  Greg Edgreen, who ran the military investigation, told us he had the Pentagon's support, but [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1562.1599999999999s)]
*  in the Trump and Biden administrations, he says, the bar for proof was set impossibly [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1568.8799999999999s)]
*  high. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1575.8799999999999s)]
*  I think it was set so high because we did not, as a country and a government, want to [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1576.72s)]
*  face some very hard truths. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1583.76s)]
*  And what are those? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1586.96s)]
*  Can we secure America? Are these massive counterintelligence failures? Can we protect American soil and [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1588.56s)]
*  our people on American soil? Are we being attacked? And if we're being attacked, is [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1595.64s)]
*  that an act of war? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1602.52s)]
*  After what he learned in his classified investigation, Greg Edgreen retired from the Army to start [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1605.04s)]
*  a company to help the victims. He hopes to channel government contracts into treatment [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1611.84s)]
*  programs. As with all spy stories, much is classified in what remains as circumstantial. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1617.72s)]
*  None of the witnesses tonight wanted to speak. Some fear for their families, but all felt [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1625.76s)]
*  compelled to shine a light on what they see as a war of shadows, a war America may not [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1632.1999999999998s)]
*  be winning. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1639.8799999999999s)]
*  If this is what we've seen with the hundreds of cases of anomalous health incidents, I [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1641.28s)]
*  can assure you that this has become probably Putin's biggest victory. In his own mind, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1646.48s)]
*  this has been Russia's biggest victory against the West. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1651.48s)]
*  In terms of the long term, would you consider this to be life-altering? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1656.56s)]
*  Absolutely life-altering for our whole family. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1663.56s)]
*  A suspected attack on Americans before Vice President Harris arrived in Vietnam. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1671.84s)]
*  I believe Russia is assisting other governments. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1679.24s)]
*  At 60MinutesOvertime.com. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1683.72s)]
*  There have been plenty of successful stand-up comedians, but few who've managed to do what [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1694.2s)]
*  Kevin Hart has. In addition to becoming a bankable movie star, he's also built an entertainment [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1698.4s)]
*  and business empire. And in March, at 44, he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1703.96s)]
*  humor, as close to a lifetime achievement award as you can get. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1709.76s)]
*  Hart's comedy isn't particularly controversial. It's conversational, with a lot of cursing [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1714.5600000000002s)]
*  thrown in. He tells revealing stories about his wife and four kids, his embarrassing insecurities, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1718.96s)]
*  and his many shortcomings. On stage, Kevin Hart is an open book, but when we sat down [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1725.52s)]
*  with him earlier this year, on one topic at least, he was a bit hard to pin down. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1731.12s)]
*  GQ said you're 5'5". The LA Times says you're 5'4". And some other place said you were 5'2". [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1738.28s)]
*  Well that place is bullsh**. GQ finally got it right. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1744.28s)]
*  5'5"? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1748.4s)]
*  5'5". 5'5". Like with a shoe on, like a sneaker. Now if I put a boot on, I can get the 5'5'1". [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1749.4s)]
*  Kevin Hart has been telling tall tales about himself on stage for more than two decades. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1756.32s)]
*  43 years old. I've been 5'5' my whole life. 5'4', 5'2' and a half my whole life. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1761.32s)]
*  It's talking about the things that you aren't afraid to laugh at about yourself. I'm really [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1770.52s)]
*  confident that the laugh that I'm getting, you're not laughing necessarily at me as if [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1776.36s)]
*  I'm a joke. You're laughing at the experience. I'm giving you an experience through a story [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1782.48s)]
*  that is relatable. And more importantly, I'm saying things that other people just don't [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1788.3600000000001s)]
*  have the heart to say. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1794.28s)]
*  I mean you told a story about your wife watching tall people porn. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1795.72s)]
*  Yeah. He was taller than me. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1799.76s)]
*  That was your main issue? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1802.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Why is he so tall? Is that what you want? We had a real conversation over that. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1803.0800000000002s)]
*  Is that what you're looking for? If your search starts with tall... [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1808.0800000000002s)]
*  You can't fix that. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1811.6s)]
*  No, I can't fix that. We got a problem. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1812.6s)]
*  One of the sites wasn't even porn. One of the sites was a bunch of tall men being active. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1813.6s)]
*  They were changing light bulbs, putting **** on shelves, hanging paintings. What kind of [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1818.48s)]
*  **** is this? What the **** is this? She was like, what? You can't do none of that stuff. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1823.48s)]
*  I like that stuff. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1828.48s)]
*  Hart is the highest grossing comedian today. He sells out arenas around the world and the [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1830.48s)]
*  occasional football stadium. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1836.24s)]
*  We sold a football stadium out tonight. So I need to hear that. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1837.92s)]
*  The wall is full of great comedians. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1842.92s)]
*  When we first met him in January at his offices in Los Angeles, he was working on new material [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1845.2s)]
*  for an upcoming comedy tour. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1850.72s)]
*  To do an hour comedy special, how long does it take? How many... [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1852.52s)]
*  You need to really work on a set. Eight to nine months. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1856.52s)]
*  Are you sitting in a room with your team? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1860.0s)]
*  No. I'm going back to ground zero. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1862.0s)]
*  Just small comedy clubs? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1864.24s)]
*  Rooms. I got two guys, Harry Rashford, Joey Wells, they act as my writers. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1866.5600000000002s)]
*  What they do is they grab my material as I say it. But you can't write it down for me. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1872.5600000000002s)]
*  I don't like the long joke to the long sentences. So it has to be in bullet points. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1879.5600000000002s)]
*  Travel. Bad. Bad travel. Why bad travel makes me drive. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1884.5600000000002s)]
*  Driving. Good versus bad. Everything has a good and a bad. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1893.48s)]
*  My rule is when I get on stage, I would much rather have the dismantled picture in my head [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1899.48s)]
*  of kind of what I think it is and it not be good and then figure it out in real time and [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1907.48s)]
*  walk off stage and go, it was something there. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1912.48s)]
*  A few hours later, 3,000 people showed up in Pasadena to hear Hart figure out his new [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1915.48s)]
*  jokes on stage. Everyone had to hand over their phones. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1921.48s)]
*  Before he began, Hart explained why. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1928.48s)]
*  Like 90% of what I'm going to do tonight I feel like is really good. The reason why I [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1931.48s)]
*  took your phones is because of the other 10%. Right? Like just in case. Just in case some [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1936.48s)]
*  of us not, you don't have no proof. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1945.48s)]
*  We agreed not to record any of his routine either, but backstage we found his collaborators [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1948.48s)]
*  Harry Ratchford and Joey Wells taking a lot of notes. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1953.48s)]
*  I appreciate y'all. I'm Kevin Hart and I love you. Good night. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1957.48s)]
*  How was this audience? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1963.48s)]
*  This audience was great. Great. Like you can feel the laughter never stop. That's the [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1964.48s)]
*  beauty of a theater. The theater lets you really feel the highs and lows of a set. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1969.48s)]
*  There's so much that he wants to do. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1974.48s)]
*  Joey Wells and Harry Ratchford, along with comedians Will Spank-Horton and Naeem Lynn [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1976.48s)]
*  are among Hart's closest friends. They're also known professionally as the Plastic Cup [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1981.48s)]
*  Boys. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1986.48s)]
*  What are you actually looking for when he's on a stage and telling a joke? What notes [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1987.48s)]
*  do you have? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1992.48s)]
*  Harry is always structured. We should put the joke here and move it around. And for [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1993.48s)]
*  me I'm always just like how can it be just a little funny? He might get a standing ovation [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=1998.48s)]
*  and I go that was great. That was great. What if he tried this? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2002.48s)]
*  Spank and Naeem have known Hart since he was a teenager, growing up in a rough neighborhood [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2006.48s)]
*  in North Philadelphia. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2011.48s)]
*  Was Kevin always as confident as he is today? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2012.48s)]
*  Yes. I mean it was perplexing in the beginning like why does this little ugly dude have this [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2016.48s)]
*  much confidence? I didn't get it. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2020.48s)]
*  North Philly. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2022.48s)]
*  Oh, what do you think he's doing? He swears he can dance. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2023.48s)]
*  Home movies his mom made show Hart was always the family entertainer. He lived in a one-bedroom [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2028.48s)]
*  apartment with his brother Robert and his mom Nancy Hart. She kept a close eye on Kevin. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2034.48s)]
*  She planned every moment of your day. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2040.48s)]
*  I had no free time. After finishing my homework, I had to get to swim practice. Me and my mom [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2042.48s)]
*  would walk home from practice. The homework that I was supposed to do beforehand, she [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2046.48s)]
*  would go over and check and end up making me redo it because nine times out of ten I [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2051.48s)]
*  rushed through it just to get it done. She would then make me read and I would skip pages, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2056.48s)]
*  not expecting the quiz of the book to come. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2061.48s)]
*  What she would give you. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2064.48s)]
*  What she would give me when I said I was done and then she would make me read it again. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2065.48s)]
*  Do you credit her with the drive you have? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2069.48s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2072.48s)]
*  His mom also kept Kevin's dad, Henry Witherspoon, at a distance. He was in and out of prison [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2074.48s)]
*  and addicted to drugs, which Hart talked about in a 2011 stand-up special called Laugh at My Pain. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2080.48s)]
*  I was in a weird Spellin' Bs debate. Now here's the thing, my dad would show up at my events [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2087.48s)]
*  and treat them as if they were athletic events. First of all, you can't cheer for no kid at a [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2092.48s)]
*  Spellin' B. It's a Spellin' B. It's quiet. I'm focused. I'm in the middle of Spellin' B, a very [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2097.48s)]
*  difficult word. My dad shows up late, busts through the back door, high as hell, making cold [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2102.48s)]
*  kid noises. All right? Once again, I cannot make this up. All right? This is all I heard. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2106.48s)]
*  I'm in the middle of Spellin' B. Out of nowhere, all I heard was, all right, all right, all right. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2111.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2117.48s)]
*  The actual details of stuff he did are really heartbreaking. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2120.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2124.48s)]
*  And yet you tell it in a way that's funny. Is it heartbreaking to you? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2125.48s)]
*  No, because- [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2129.48s)]
*  It must have been at the time. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2130.48s)]
*  I see it for what it was. As a kid, that's dead. By the way, in my environment, that's the norm. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2131.48s)]
*  It's normal to see a parent drunk or whatever. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2138.48s)]
*  Your dad, even in the depths of his drug use, he wanted to see you and your brother. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2143.48s)]
*  Absolutely. There was a period where he disappeared, but I hadn't seen him in a long time. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2148.48s)]
*  And I saw him on the subway, and he was in bad shape. And I was like, Dad? He turned around and saw me, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2151.48s)]
*  and doors opened, my dad walked off and ran. Later told me I ran because it just hurt me for you to see me like that. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2158.48s)]
*  And that was one of his key factors in the going and getting help. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2167.48s)]
*  Hart was eventually able to help his dad get clean before he died in 2022. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2171.48s)]
*  My dad is crazy. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2176.48s)]
*  Kevin said his father loved to hear the stories he told about him in front of thousands of people. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2177.48s)]
*  So we talked about my dad. We celebrated my dad. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2182.48s)]
*  But when Hart started doing stand-up at 18, he struggled to find places to perform. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2186.48s)]
*  You would take gigs wherever you could get them. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2195.48s)]
*  You're talking bowling alleys, you're talking cabarets, strip clubs. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2197.48s)]
*  Is there a lot of comedy in strip clubs? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2202.48s)]
*  No! And it's a white thing. No! I don't know who thought that comedy and strippers mix. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2204.48s)]
*  But I remember one of the most heartbreaking moments for me on stage was in the middle of my set. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2211.48s)]
*  This was at a strip club. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2215.48s)]
*  And I remember hearing this lady go, oh baby. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2217.48s)]
*  After you told the joke. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2220.48s)]
*  Oh baby. Like basically. So disgusted and heartbroken that this is what I chose to do with my life. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2222.48s)]
*  Hart thought he was about to make it big when he shot a sitcom for ABC called The Big House in 2003. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2231.48s)]
*  The network flew him out to the up fronts to present the show to advertisers and the media. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2238.48s)]
*  I'm next to walk on stage so they can announce The Big House. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2244.48s)]
*  You're the guy with the microphone that's backstage managing the... [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2247.48s)]
*  This is what I see. He's right here. I'm with him. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2250.48s)]
*  All right, I'll tell him right now. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2254.48s)]
*  Kevin, hold up one second. They just said they're not going to go through or pick it up. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2256.48s)]
*  Somebody should be back here to talk to you shortly. What does that mean? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2260.48s)]
*  The guy with the microphone is telling you that your series is not being picked up by the network. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2263.48s)]
*  Not the network exec. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2268.48s)]
*  Not the CEO of Disney coming out saying hey. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2270.48s)]
*  No, no, no. A guy named Barry in the back holding the curtain. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2273.48s)]
*  It was only because of that rejection. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2278.48s)]
*  I don't want to feel that. I don't like that you got to hire me when you're ready. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2280.48s)]
*  You're saying that my career is basically determined off of the needs of people that I don't know and that I don't talk to? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2286.48s)]
*  I might be sitting here all day if I don't go grab it and I don't go make what I feel should be mine. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2297.48s)]
*  And that is what he did. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2305.48s)]
*  He started a small production company now called Heartbeat and began making his own hour-long stand-up specials. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2307.48s)]
*  He also marketed himself relentlessly through social media. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2314.48s)]
*  Freeze! [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2318.48s)]
*  Hollywood studios took notice. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2319.48s)]
*  Get on my back. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2322.48s)]
*  I would rather die. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2324.48s)]
*  Jump on my back. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2325.48s)]
*  No, I'm going to die. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2326.48s)]
*  Let me down! [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2327.48s)]
*  Kevin, what's up? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2329.48s)]
*  When he was picked in 2018 to host the Oscars, it seemed like a high point in his career. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2330.48s)]
*  I have nothing against gay people. Be happy. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2336.48s)]
*  But then comments he made about gay people years earlier on stage and on Twitter caused controversy. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2337.48s)]
*  With me being a heterosexual male, if I can prevent my son from being gay, I will. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2343.48s)]
*  Heart stepped down as the Oscars host. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2348.48s)]
*  Initially you didn't apologize. Later on you did. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2350.48s)]
*  Well, later on the understanding came from the best light bulb ever. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2352.48s)]
*  Wanda Sykes said, there's people that are being hurt today because of comments like the ones that you made then. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2357.48s)]
*  And there's people that will say it's okay to make those comments today based off of what you did then. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2364.48s)]
*  It was presented to me in a way where I couldn't ignore that. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2370.48s)]
*  So in those moments of despair, great understanding and education can't come out of it if you're given the opportunity. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2375.48s)]
*  These days it's hard to keep track of all the businesses Heart has a hand in. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2383.48s)]
*  The weekend we spent with him he was in constant motion and promotion, starting with his daily pre-dawn workout. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2388.48s)]
*  Sixty minutes, is this what you want? This what you want? I'm going to get you what you want. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2397.48s)]
*  So the good thing is that we make it out of here. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2402.48s)]
*  Then he was off to Walmart to publicize a nutrition supplement company he owns. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2404.48s)]
*  To reach people. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2408.48s)]
*  Finally, you're a real person. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2409.48s)]
*  I am. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2410.48s)]
*  He's also got a fast food chain, a tequila brand and a $100 million venture capital fund. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2411.48s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2419.48s)]
*  And Heartbeat, that little production company he started, is now worth more than $650 million. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2420.48s)]
*  I'm no longer just a comedian. I'm an investment. I'm a studio. I'm a partner. Looking for partnerships. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2427.48s)]
*  Work for hire is not in my best interest if it's a one and done situation. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2436.48s)]
*  That means the endless stream of movies, shows, podcasts and commercials Kevin Heart pops up in. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2442.48s)]
*  Chances are Heartbeat is making money off them too. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2449.48s)]
*  Even my stunt double has a stunt double. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2454.48s)]
*  Are you a billionaire yet? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2456.48s)]
*  I'm not in here business. He's trying to get me robbed. He's trying to get me knocked in my bed. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2458.48s)]
*  You will be a billionaire. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7chVpC4A8&t=2462.48s)]
