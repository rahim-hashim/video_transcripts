**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [May 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI)
*  The story of a friend [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=0.0s)]
*  In the wars since 9-11, thousands of Americans have lost sons or daughters. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=13.68s)]
*  Bereaved parents often become isolated in a familiar world. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=19.44s)]
*  Friends don't know what to say about a grief no words can touch. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=23.28s)]
*  There's no term in the dictionary for a parent who's lost a child. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=28.6s)]
*  So these mothers and fathers call themselves gold star parents. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=32.2s)]
*  It's in the tradition of the military service flag that hung in homes during [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=36.92s)]
*  the world wars. Each blue star on the banner stood for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  a loved one overseas. Gold honored those never coming home. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=44.84s)]
*  Now some of these families are finding solace [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=50.44s)]
*  once a year in San Francisco in the embrace [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=53.64s)]
*  of the only people who can truly understand [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=56.92s)]
*  other gold star parents traveling the same endless road. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  In downtown San Francisco stands an unusual war memorial [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=70.6s)]
*  looking as it did in the 1920s when it was a hotel and theater. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  After World War II, Marines wanted a living memorial so they transformed this into a club [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=80.84s)]
*  that today honors all vets. I look at this building it's like a ship [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  that sails every February. That once we're inside here we're safe. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=96.84s)]
*  We can be ourselves. We don't have to explain to anybody. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  It's sort of a subliminal language that we all understand. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=105.16s)]
*  Mary Shea learned the language of loss when her son was killed. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=109.24s)]
*  It's a language that cannot be translated and so she and her husband Bill felt [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=113.88s)]
*  they could no longer be understood. You're kind of cast adrift [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=119.0s)]
*  and you're sort of floating nowhere and you don't know [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=124.28s)]
*  where to go or what to do and there they were understanding better than we [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=128.44s)]
*  understood the support that we needed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=135.32s)]
*  The gathering the Shays attend every year is organized by women who call [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=138.6s)]
*  themselves the Blue Star Moms of the East Bay Area. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=143.16s)]
*  Blue Stars with sons and daughters who served overseas. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=147.24s)]
*  About 200 of California's gold stars attend this honor and remembrance event [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=151.56s)]
*  which begins with a reception. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  The next morning each of the fallen receives a prayer. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=161.72s)]
*  A grateful nation acknowledges your sacrifice [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=165.72s)]
*  and praise for your peace. Later gold star parents and counselors lead [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=169.88s)]
*  conversations for smaller groups like single parents and siblings. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=175.24s)]
*  It's all invitation only, no press. The only pictures we have are from the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=180.12s)]
*  Marines Memorial Association. Part of the hotel has become a memorial [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=185.16s)]
*  wall where every lost loved one since 9-11 is remembered. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  6,846 stories. Tim Shay was 22. He fought two tours in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=196.12s)]
*  Afghanistan and was in Iraq on his third tour there [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=204.84s)]
*  when his vehicle hit a bomb in August of 2005. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=209.72s)]
*  A night, a Thursday night about 9 30 there was a knock at the door and we were sort [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=214.04s)]
*  of getting ready to go to bed and I was in the bedroom and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=219.32s)]
*  and then I heard Mary's voice. Bill come here right now come here come [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  here come here and I went out there and as [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=232.28s)]
*  soon as we saw them we knew what was what we were facing. Saw who? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=234.84s)]
*  Saw the soldiers. There was a chaplain there was a and two other was it two [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=239.4s)]
*  other soldiers who were there to tell us. Tim [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=244.28s)]
*  grew up in Northern California. Dad a lawyer, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=248.6s)]
*  mom a teacher. How often do you come? Well I come most every day [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=252.2s)]
*  and just have a little chat with Tim. Ten years ago at Tim's funeral Mary [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  noticed women she'd never seen before. Where did these people come from and why [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=265.88s)]
*  are they here? Why do they care? The strangers were blue star moms [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=270.52s)]
*  including Nancy Totman. How many of these funerals have you been to? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=275.56s)]
*  42 funerals and each one is difficult. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=280.2s)]
*  It it just rips your heart out to know that another family their life their [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=289.64s)]
*  normal is never the same. I can think of a couple of parents [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=297.72s)]
*  right off hand. Deb Saunders understood their isolation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=301.32s)]
*  You can express your sympathy but you cannot empathize with someone [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=305.88s)]
*  unless you're walking in their shoes and that's what I knew [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=309.88s)]
*  we had to do was somehow gather these folks together that they were [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=313.32s)]
*  better equipped in their in their journey [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=317.48s)]
*  to help one another. To gather the gold stars [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=321.08s)]
*  Deb Saunders reached out to a tough old leatherneck, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=325.32s)]
*  retired marine major general Mike Myatt, the president and CEO of the Marines [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=328.44s)]
*  Memorial Association. Deb Saunders she was a blue star mom. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=333.48s)]
*  She came to me one day and she said I'm worried about the gold star moms. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=338.04s)]
*  We need to provide some kind of comfort for them. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=343.24s)]
*  I knew General Myatt had the resources to help us do it but I also knew we had [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=347.08s)]
*  the heart and that's exactly what this took. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=350.84s)]
*  Hart led Myatt to order the wall where you find [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=353.64s)]
*  senior airman Jonathan Vega Yelner. He had volunteered after his single mom [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=357.64s)]
*  discovered that he was ditching class in college. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=363.47999999999996s)]
*  I said Jonathan I'm going to give you two options [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  because you fooled mommy. You have a choice [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=370.28s)]
*  Navy or Air Force. Pick one. Yolanda Vega thought those were the safer [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=374.76s)]
*  options. He came over and he hugged me and walked away and as he's walking [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=381.56s)]
*  straight toward the recruiter he just went like this. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=387.8s)]
*  He never looked back. The Air Force gave him maturity [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=391.24s)]
*  and purpose. He served in Iraq then Afghanistan [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  and there safe on base he volunteered for an [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=399.0s)]
*  army patrol. There was a bomb. He was 24. I was told that he was killed [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=402.76s)]
*  instantly. Thank you God and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=410.76s)]
*  yeah [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=419.96s)]
*  my baby. Yolanda barricaded herself behind close friends and family. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=424.76s)]
*  Blue Star moms sought her out and she was amazed. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=431.24s)]
*  Being a Blue Star mother coming over to a Gold Star mother and hugging [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=436.12s)]
*  were their worst nightmare and yet they are so willing [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=441.24s)]
*  to be part of our lives and ensuring our well-being. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=449.72s)]
*  I couldn't have done it without them. Your eyes light up when you talk about [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=453.4s)]
*  them and I'm trying to understand what it was that you found so [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=457.24s)]
*  uplifting redeeming about that experience. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=463.16s)]
*  I knew that my son would always be remembered [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=468.52000000000004s)]
*  and that's one of the biggest fears Gold Star families have that our [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=476.04s)]
*  children will be forgotten. That's not going to happen. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=482.36s)]
*  The children as parents will always call them [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=487.40000000000003s)]
*  are celebrated at tribute tables. Their child lives again in every new [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=490.52s)]
*  introduction because when Tim was a senior and we asked a few families to [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=495.71999999999997s)]
*  assemble for us their tabletop biographies. This is a [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=499.96s)]
*  picture when she was little. Yeah. Meet Alicia Good, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=503.56s)]
*  daughter of Claire and Paul, a senior airman [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=508.76s)]
*  armed with what had to be the biggest smile in the Air Force. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=512.2s)]
*  As you're with more than a hundred other tables at the event, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=517.0s)]
*  people come by. What does it do for you? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=520.76s)]
*  It gives us a sense of that she didn't lose her life for nothing. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=524.44s)]
*  In 2006 Alicia Good was on counter-terrorism duty near the Horn of [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=529.72s)]
*  Africa when her helicopter collided with another. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=534.2s)]
*  She was 23. Her daughter Tabitha was two. Tabitha just recently went through her [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=538.36s)]
*  mom's wardrobe. First thing she did was put on her [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=544.2s)]
*  uniform and just looked just like her mom. It was [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=547.72s)]
*  cute. She realizes that her mom's special [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=551.5600000000001s)]
*  and that she won't be forgotten and she tells people [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=555.88s)]
*  my mommy's a fallen hero. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=559.8000000000001s)]
*  About a day goes by I don't think about my son. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=564.5200000000001s)]
*  He was Mike Jr. He's my only son. He's my first born. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=568.5200000000001s)]
*  Mike Anderson Sr. has been coming to the event [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=573.32s)]
*  all 11 years. When you see that new family come through the door [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=576.9200000000001s)]
*  at the next meeting what do you tell them? Tell them that we love them, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=583.48s)]
*  we welcome them. Again we're walking the same dark valley. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=587.1600000000001s)]
*  I know how you feel. It does get a little better [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=590.36s)]
*  over time. People talk about closure. There's never real closure, at least not [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=593.96s)]
*  in my mind, but there are steps forward to ease the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=598.7600000000001s)]
*  pain to help with that closure. What are those? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=602.04s)]
*  The steps to ease the pain? Faith for me. Going abroad [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=605.0s)]
*  2006, going to Iraq myself to see some of the same faces, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=612.28s)]
*  be in the region, breathe some of the same air that my son [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=616.52s)]

*  Iraq as a civilian. It was a need for me. It was more than just a want. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=623.4s)]
*  Mike Anderson Jr. joined the marines the minute he got out of high school. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=629.4s)]
*  In 2004, 11 days before Christmas, he was shot retaking the city of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=634.4399999999999s)]
*  Fallujah. The burden that you have is [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=640.36s)]
*  unbearable at times, yes sir. But when you come to this event [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=644.84s)]
*  you take on the unbearable burdens of another hundred families. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=651.16s)]
*  My son went abroad to help people that he never met, that would probably never [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=655.48s)]
*  ever see again. It's just that in some ways it's human [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=659.24s)]
*  nature to want to help others. And people ask me what do you say to the [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=664.2s)]
*  Gold Star parents? I say well you don't have to say anything to them. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=668.52s)]
*  Just ask them. Tell me about your son or your daughter. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=671.96s)]
*  Man they'll just talk, they just tell you all they can [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  about the son or daughter. It's really something. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=679.4s)]
*  I wish I had known this as a young officer [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=684.36s)]
*  because I went to Vietnam and I had people killed out of my platoon. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=688.2s)]
*  And I was going to go visit each family and the very last one was in Kansas. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=693.4000000000001s)]
*  I was visiting them and I went to the house and the father said come [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=700.6800000000001s)]
*  on in. And the mother, she got on her apron [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=706.6800000000001s)]
*  she said I just fixed dinner, would you have dinner with us? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=709.96s)]
*  Said no I'm in a hurry but I want to tell you about your son. And I [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=713.08s)]
*  told him how he was killed and everything. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=717.08s)]
*  They really appreciated it. Then won't you stay for dinner? I did. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=719.4000000000001s)]
*  I would not. I realize now [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=722.6800000000001s)]
*  they wanted to tell me about their son and I wasn't mature enough to know it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=728.36s)]
*  That's why they wanted you to stay. Yeah and now I [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=735.48s)]
*  know it. For General Mayotte there is redemption now [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=742.0400000000001s)]
*  in making a home for the memories. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=747.4s)]
*  I remember one time visiting my son's gravesite and thinking about [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=752.6s)]
*  how every day they would face the day and realize that this is dangerous [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=758.0400000000001s)]
*  and they did it anyway. I have a duty to do [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=766.52s)]
*  and this duty is dangerous and I'm going to do it. Tim's death [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=769.96s)]
*  transferred that duty to you. Right. The duty to [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=774.12s)]
*  live your lives and to help other people in the same [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=778.6s)]
*  situation that you're in. I think that's right. I think that's right [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=781.96s)]
*  and that that's the best way to honor him. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=785.96s)]

*  that erupts from high explosives. The evidence [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=830.76s)]
*  was found in the brains of veterans who died and tonight [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=834.1999999999999s)]
*  we have a rare opportunity to introduce you [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=838.04s)]
*  to one of the vets who made the discovery possible. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=841.16s)]
*  Retired Army Sergeant First Class Brian Mancini [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=844.4399999999999s)]
*  killed himself in 2017 after descending into psychosis [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=848.28s)]
*  but we met Mancini years before in 2011 after he made a nearly miraculous [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=853.3199999999999s)]
*  recovery from the impact of a roadside bomb in Iraq. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=859.24s)]
*  There's no one better to begin this story than the late Brian Mancini [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=863.0799999999999s)]
*  himself. I got hit in the face. I knew pretty early that I had lost [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=867.4s)]
*  my eye. I didn't know how severe my injuries were [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=873.0799999999999s)]
*  but I knew I was hurt very bad. We met Brian Mancini six years before his [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=876.12s)]
*  suicide. We had followed a group of wounded vets [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=881.4s)]
*  back to Iraq on a therapy program endorsed by the [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=885.0s)]
*  Pentagon designed to help them come to terms with the day they were wounded [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=888.6s)]
*  and leave that day behind. You know we often hear about guys that [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=893.5600000000001s)]
*  carry these heartaches their whole lives and it slowly erodes them. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=899.16s)]
*  I don't want to be that guy you know I want to be able to [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=904.92s)]
*  have a successful life and not burdened with the demons that were [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=908.76s)]
*  that I've seen here. I'm glad I'm alive. On that return trip to Iraq Mancini [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=916.92s)]
*  visited the field hospital that saved him. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=922.36s)]
*  My whole face has been rebuilt. I used to look like Brad Pitt. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=925.0799999999999s)]
*  This is what I got stuck with. I have a titanium mesh plate in my forehead. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=931.96s)]
*  They rebuilt my whole orbital socket. My sinuses were [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=937.32s)]
*  replaced or rebuilt. How many surgeries did that come to? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=941.0s)]
*  I have no idea. I have no idea. Years of surgeries, pain and struggle [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=945.56s)]
*  were witnessed by Brian Mancini's brother and sister [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=953.08s)]
*  Michael and Nicole. Oh he was a patriot. He loved this country. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=956.6s)]
*  He loved this country. He was a natural leader and I think that [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=966.0400000000001s)]
*  the military was a natural fit for him and he was good at his job and he loved [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=970.0400000000001s)]
*  it. I came up with this idea. After his [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=977.08s)]
*  recovery he created a new job for himself. At home in Phoenix he founded [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=979.72s)]
*  Honor House to provide wounded vets with therapies that helped him [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=984.52s)]
*  including yoga, acupuncture and especially [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=988.84s)]
*  fly fishing. He came leaps and bounds and Brian two years ago was the best Brian [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=992.1999999999999s)]
*  I've ever known in my life. But as he reached his peak in 2015 [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=997.56s)]
*  Mancini suddenly began to suffer delusions. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1002.6s)]
*  He imagined the government was spying on him that members of the Honor House [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1006.1999999999999s)]
*  Board were with the CIA and he thought he was being tracked with [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1010.52s)]
*  cell phones. It was delusional. It was irrational. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1014.76s)]
*  It was like a progression. He wouldn't let us have our cell phones [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1019.56s)]
*  around him. Very paranoid. His mind had started to almost turn against him. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1022.76s)]
*  His mind had turned against him. Yeah. Brian would often say I don't know if [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1027.6399999999999s)]
*  this is real or if I if I dreamt it. The Honor House Board took control of [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1033.4s)]
*  the charity from Mancini. He had been depressed before but not [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1038.52s)]
*  insane. Last year Mancini donated his life [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1043.08s)]
*  savings to his church, drove to this remote canal and shot [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1047.08s)]
*  himself in the head. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1051.48s)]
*  The betrayal of his mind had been so sudden, so shocking [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1058.2s)]
*  that his family was certain there must be a cause that no one understood. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1061.8s)]
*  And the first initial thought to me was I need to find someone who would take [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1066.6s)]
*  my brother's brain tissue for further study and further research. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1073.08s)]
*  The Mancini's found neuropathologist Dr. Daniel Pearl. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1076.9199999999998s)]
*  Pearl oversees the brain tissue repository at the Uniformed Services [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1081.56s)]
*  University of the Health Sciences, the military medical school in Bethesda, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1086.36s)]
*  Maryland. Pearl also wondered whether some [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1091.24s)]
*  torments of war might be rooted in an undiscovered kind of brain injury [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1094.76s)]
*  caused by the supersonic pressure wave of high explosives. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1100.12s)]
*  That started in World War I and we had the whole issue of shell shock and then [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1104.28s)]
*  in World War II we had battle fatigue and in Korea we had PTSD. I mean these [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1108.44s)]
*  were all expressions of responses to being in [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1114.28s)]
*  warfare, much of it being exposed to blast. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1118.12s)]
*  And we knew nothing about what was going on in the brain. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1123.08s)]
*  Pearl's team sliced brain tissue from eight veterans [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1127.3999999999999s)]
*  and examined the tissue under a microscope, rare for its power. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1130.84s)]
*  That doesn't look like the one I had in high school. No, it's not. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1135.1599999999999s)]
*  Pearl says his microscope is thousands of times more powerful than the best [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1139.0s)]
*  MRI and it helped them discover this previously unknown form of brain injury [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1143.8s)]
*  when Pearl compared the brains of the vets to civilians [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1149.48s)]
*  who had injured their brains in car wrecks. The difference is just so [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1153.48s)]
*  dramatic. These on the left are people who suffered... [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1157.4s)]
*  A single individual's brain who suffered an automobile accident, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1161.08s)]
*  a single individual who was exposed to blast, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1165.08s)]
*  stained identically for scarring. The brown area is the stain that [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1168.44s)]
*  reveals the scarring and you don't see it in the person who hit their head in [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1174.6s)]
*  the automobile accident. That's right. When an IED goes off, there's a [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1179.16s)]
*  tremendous explosion and with the explosion comes the [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1184.8400000000001s)]
*  formation of something called the blast wave and [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1189.24s)]
*  it is sufficiently powerful to pass through the skull [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1192.6000000000001s)]
*  and through the brain and when it does that, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1196.52s)]
*  it does damage the brain tissue. Do you have a slide of Brian [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1199.64s)]
*  Mancini's brain? Yes, we do. The dark brown is scarring, running along [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1203.64s)]
*  lines where two types of brain tissue meet, the so-called [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1210.1200000000001s)]
*  gray matter and white matter. The locations were areas of the brain [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1213.96s)]
*  that had differing densities. This was the [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1218.3600000000001s)]
*  interface between gray matter and white matter, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1221.64s)]
*  between brain and fluid such as spinal fluid [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1225.3200000000002s)]
*  or brain and blood. Why do you see the scarring [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1229.16s)]
*  where the white matter and the gray matter come together? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1233.8000000000002s)]
*  The white matter have a somewhat higher density than the gray matter [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1237.24s)]
*  and that's where the energy of the blast wave is released. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1240.8400000000001s)]
*  They bang together? In the sense, yeah. Do you see this scarring at these [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1244.3600000000001s)]
*  interfaces throughout the entire brain? We're [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1249.16s)]
*  looking at that now, okay? By and large, yes. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1252.8400000000001s)]
*  Evidence of this scarring was found in all of the veterans, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1256.84s)]
*  none of the civilians. Do you believe that you're going to find a connection [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1260.4399999999998s)]
*  between this and post-traumatic stress disorder? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1264.84s)]
*  In a sense, we already have. Every case that we've looked at has [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1269.08s)]
*  been diagnosed with PTSD and what that connection is, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1273.3999999999999s)]
*  the nature of that connection, whether the scarring in the brain leads one [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1280.28s)]
*  to be more apt to develop PTSD or whether there's so much overlap [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1284.84s)]
*  between the symptoms that when one gets with the damage in the brain that it [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1289.8s)]
*  looks like PTSD, we don't know yet. Do you see there's a [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1294.84s)]
*  little tiny hole there? That is an abnormality. Earlier this [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1298.12s)]
*  season, we reported on research by another [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1302.04s)]
*  laboratory into vets who showed evidence of CTE, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1305.1599999999999s)]
*  the kind of brain injury found in football players. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1309.1599999999999s)]
*  Dr. Pearl says his team has discovered something [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1312.6s)]
*  distinct from CTE. Very different, okay? One is a huge blast wave [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1315.8799999999999s)]
*  that almost destroys his face, passes through his brain. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1322.84s)]
*  It's a one-time thing, okay? It's not the sort of [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1327.32s)]
*  daily and weekly [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1330.6799999999998s)]
*  impact injury that an NFL player has. The other thing is that our [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1334.76s)]
*  service members are coming home from deployment symptomatic. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1341.72s)]
*  By and large, CTE in the football player, for instance, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1345.88s)]
*  occurs in their retirement after they've played. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1349.8s)]
*  Years later. Well, years later, right. They become symptomatic. So [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1354.3600000000001s)]
*  the timing of it seemed to be a very different proposition. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1358.76s)]
*  But it's absolutely clear to you that Brian Mancini did not have [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1362.44s)]
*  CTE. That's right. We looked very carefully for CTE [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1366.52s)]
*  in Brian's brain and he just did not have it. So [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1370.52s)]
*  what you and your colleagues have discovered is something new. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1373.72s)]
*  Yes, yes. This is new. This has changed thinking about blast [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1376.92s)]
*  exposure and its consequences. We were able to add [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1383.32s)]
*  something to Dr. Pearl's research that he rarely sees, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1387.16s)]
*  a description of the blast that wounded one of his deceased subjects. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1391.08s)]
*  Most of my forehead was blasted out. I had a basal skull fracture [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1396.04s)]
*  along with some fracture of vertebrae in my back and some burns and shrapnel. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1399.56s)]
*  When I was doing the assessment of my injuries, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1404.52s)]
*  I remember laying down and opening my mouth as [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1407.8799999999999s)]
*  wide as possible and reaching in and scraping the debris [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1411.56s)]
*  that had been knocked loose in the blood from my airway so I could breathe. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1415.72s)]
*  And shortly after that, I lost consciousness. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1421.08s)]
*  It's just stunning to see this. It's not something I normally get to experience. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1425.8s)]
*  I mean that he survived this injury is just remarkable, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1433.96s)]
*  much less what happened afterwards. Now that the discovery is known, Pearl [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1437.08s)]
*  Hope's research can begin into improving the lives of those who [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1443.32s)]
*  suffer with this hidden wound of war. What's your theory today on how this [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1447.24s)]
*  damage manifests itself in a living human being? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1452.52s)]
*  Well obviously wherever there is damage there must be some [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1456.12s)]
*  loss of function, persistent headaches, they have problems [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1459.4s)]
*  with sleep, they have problems concentrating, memory problems, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1463.32s)]
*  swings of mood, anger management problems. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1467.32s)]
*  The discovery is a lone fact that raises many questions. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1471.0s)]
*  Can the scarring ever be seen in a living patient? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1475.0s)]
*  How do the scars affect the mind and what can be done? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1478.76s)]
*  If Brian Mancini had come to you in the last year of his life, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1482.76s)]
*  would you have been able to do anything for him? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1487.1599999999999s)]
*  No I don't think so. I don't think so. We're not there yet. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1489.6399999999999s)]
*  We have a lot of people now beginning to take it seriously [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1492.84s)]
*  and begin work on it. It's not just us in our lab. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1496.6799999999998s)]
*  It's really been a game changer in terms of our approach to this problem. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1501.08s)]
*  Dr. Pearl is now searching for preserved brains of World War I veterans [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1505.4s)]
*  to see if the scarring dates to the beginning of widespread use of high [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1510.68s)]
*  explosives in war. Brian Mancini's life was devoted to [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1514.68s)]
*  wounded warriors, first as an army medic, then in [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1519.96s)]
*  rehabilitation, and now even in death. His work to heal [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1524.0400000000002s)]
*  continues. And this is what Brian would have wanted? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1528.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh absolutely. Without a doubt. Brian's still serving his country. Amen. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1532.2s)]
*  I wouldn't trade any of these horrendous and horrific experiences [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1538.52s)]
*  for anything. There's a lesson in everything [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1542.8400000000001s)]
*  that we endure in life and if we can clear all the chaos away and all the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1546.6000000000001s)]
*  heartache away, we can receive that lesson. Why was I [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1552.3600000000001s)]
*  here? What was this for? Why did this happen? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1556.92s)]
*  And kind of get some of those answers. And I think that helps in healing long [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1559.16s)]
*  term. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1564.68s)]
*  Until a few years ago, NFL players who struggled with severe depression, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1577.0s)]
*  bouts of rage, and memory loss in their retirement [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1581.3200000000002s)]
*  were often told they were just having a hard time adjusting to life away from [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1584.6000000000001s)]
*  the game. Doctors have since learned these changes [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1588.52s)]
*  can be symptoms of the degenerative brain disease [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1592.36s)]
*  CTE, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, caused by blows to the head. What we're [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1595.16s)]
*  learning now is that CTE isn't just affecting athletes, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1601.32s)]
*  but also showing up in our nation's heroes. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1605.16s)]
*  Since 9-11, over 300,000 soldiers have returned home with brain injuries. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1608.28s)]
*  Researchers fear the impact of CTE could cripple a generation of warriors. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1614.28s)]
*  When Joy Kiefer buried her 34-year-old son this past summer, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1633.64s)]
*  it was the end of a long goodbye. May his soul rest in peace. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1637.96s)]
*  Kiefer's son, Sergeant Kevin Ash, enlisted in the Army Reserves at the age of 18. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1642.92s)]
*  Over three deployments, he was exposed to 12 combat blasts, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1648.52s)]
*  many of them roadside bombs. He returned home in 2012, a different man. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1652.6000000000001s)]
*  His whole personality had changed. I thought it was exposure to all of the [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1658.3600000000001s)]
*  things that he had seen and he just had become harder, you know. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1665.4s)]
*  But he was not happy. So at this point, you're thinking this [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1670.84s)]
*  decline, this change in my child is just that he's been in war and he's seen too much. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1677.0s)]
*  Right. Did he tell you about blasts that he experienced during that time? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1682.36s)]
*  What did he tell you? That they shook him and he was having [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1685.9599999999998s)]
*  blackouts and it frightened him. Ash withdrew from family and friends. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1690.9199999999998s)]
*  He was angry, depressed. Doctors prescribed therapy and medication. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1696.84s)]
*  But his health began to decline quickly. By his 34th birthday, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1701.8799999999999s)]
*  Sergeant Kevin Ash was unable to speak, walk or eat on his own. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1706.6s)]
*  Looking back on it now, was there anything you feel like he could have done? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1711.56s)]
*  Because? Because it was his brain. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1716.36s)]
*  The thing I didn't know is that his brain was continuing to die. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1719.72s)]
*  I mean, before we went into the service, he said, you know, I could come back with no legs [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1724.44s)]
*  or no arms or even blind or I could be shot. I could die. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1729.8s)]
*  But nobody ever said that he could lose his mind one day at a time. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1739.0s)]
*  His final wish was to serve his country one last time by donating his brain to science. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1745.16s)]
*  A gesture he thought would bring better understanding to the invisible wounds of war. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1751.0s)]
*  Joy reached out to the VA Boston University Concussion Legacy Foundation Brain Bank, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1756.04s)]
*  where neuropathologist Dr. Ann McKee is leading the charge in researching head trauma [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1762.1200000000001s)]
*  and the degenerative brain disease, CTE. I think about some of the military cases. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1767.5600000000002s)]
*  McKee has spent 14 years looking at the postmortem brains of hundreds of athletes [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1772.1200000000001s)]
*  who suffered concussions while playing their sport. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1777.0s)]
*  This past summer, her findings shook the football world when she discovered CTE in the brains of [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1781.8s)]
*  110 out of 111 deceased NFL players, raising serious concerns for those in the game today. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1788.84s)]
*  And when Dr. McKee autopsied Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1797.48s)]
*  who killed himself after being convicted of murder, she found the most severe case of CTE [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1801.48s)]
*  in someone under 30. Now she's seeing a similar pattern in deceased veterans [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1807.4s)]
*  who experience a different kind of head trauma, combat blasts. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1813.0800000000002s)]
*  Of the 102 veterans brains Dr. McKee's examined, 66 had CTE. I can understand a football player [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1821.64s)]
*  who keeps, you know, hitting his head and having impact and concussions, but how is it that combat [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1829.48s)]
*  veteran who may be just experienced a blast has the same type of injury? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1836.04s)]
*  This blast injury causes a tremendous sort of ricochet or a whiplash injury to the brain [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1840.2s)]
*  inside the skull. And that's what gives rise to the same changes that we see in football players, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1847.08s)]
*  as in military veterans. Blast trauma was first recognized back in World War I. Known as shell [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1852.68s)]
*  shock, poorly protected soldiers often died immediately or went on to suffer physical and [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1859.48s)]
*  psychological symptoms. Today, sophisticated armor allows more soldiers to walk away from [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1865.32s)]
*  an explosion, but exposure can still damage the brain, an injury that can worsen over time. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1873.24s)]
*  It's not a new injury, but what's been really stumping us, I think, as physicians is it's not [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1880.28s)]
*  easily detectable, right? You've got a lot of psychiatric symptoms and you can't see it very [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1886.6s)]
*  well on images of the brain. And so it didn't occur to us. And I think that's been the gap, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1892.28s)]
*  really, that this has been what everyone calls an invisible injury. This is the world's largest CTE [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1896.92s)]
*  brain thing. The only foolproof way to diagnose CTE is by testing a postmortem brain. So these [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1904.12s)]
*  are full of hundreds of brains? Hundreds of brains, thousands really. Researchers carefully [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1911.32s)]
*  dissect sections of the brain where they look for changes in the folds of the frontal lobes, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1916.36s)]
*  an area responsible for memory, judgment, emotions, impulse control, and personality. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1921.16s)]
*  Do you see there's a little tiny hole there? That is an abnormality. That is a clear abnormality. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1926.92s)]
*  And what would that affect? Well, it's part of the memory circuit. You can see that clear hole [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1932.68s)]
*  there that shouldn't be there. It's connecting the important memory regions of the brain with [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1937.96s)]
*  other regions. So that is a sign of CTE. Thin slivers of the affected areas are then stained [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1943.24s)]
*  and viewed microscopically. It's in these final stages where a diagnosis becomes clear, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1950.76s)]
*  as in the case of Sergeant Kevin Ash. So this is Sergeant Ash's brain? Right. This is four sections [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1957.0s)]
*  of his brain. And what you can see is these lesions. And those lesions are CTE. And they're [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1964.36s)]
*  in very characteristic parts of the brain. They're at the bottom of the crevice. That's a unique [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1971.56s)]
*  feature of CTE. And in a healthy brain, you wouldn't see any of those kind of brown spots? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1977.32s)]
*  No. No. It would be completely clear. And then when you look microscopically, you can see that [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1982.36s)]
*  the tau, which is staining brown and is inside nerve cells, is surrounding these little vessels. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1987.56s)]
*  And explain what is the tau? So tau is a protein that's normally in the nerve cell. It helps with [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1993.1599999999999s)]
*  structure. And after trauma, it starts clumping up as a toxin inside the nerve cell. And over time, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=1999.88s)]
*  and even years, gradually that nerve cell dies. Dr. Lee Goldstein has been building on Dr. McKee's [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2007.96s)]
*  work with testing on mice. We're in the neurotrauma laboratory. Inside his Boston University lab, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2016.1200000000001s)]
*  Dr. Goldstein built this 27-foot blast tube where a mouse, and in this demonstration, a model, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2022.76s)]
*  is exposed to an explosion equivalent to the IEDs used in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2030.12s)]
*  When it reaches about 25, this thing is going to go. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2035.32s)]
*  Dr. Goldstein's model shows what's going on inside the brain during a blast. The brightly [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2043.8799999999999s)]
*  colored waves illustrate stress on the soft tissues of the brain as it ricochets back and [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2049.56s)]
*  forth within the skull. What we see after these blast exposures, the animals actually look fine, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2055.0s)]
*  which is shocking to us. They come out of what is a near lethal blast exposure, just like our military [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2062.12s)]
*  service men and women do, and they appear to be fine. But what we know is that that brain [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2070.2s)]
*  is not the same after that exposure as it was microseconds before, and if there is a subsequent [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2078.36s)]
*  exposure, that change will be accelerated, and ultimately this triggers a neurodegenerative [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2085.56s)]
*  disease. In fact, we can see that really after even one of these exposures. The Department of [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2091.56s)]
*  Defense estimates hundreds of thousands of soldiers who've experienced a blast like this. What does [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2096.84s)]
*  that tell you? This is a disease and a problem that we're going to be dealing with for decades, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2102.04s)]
*  and it is a huge public health problem. It's a huge problem for the Veterans Administration. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2108.92s)]
*  It's a huge moral responsibility for all of us. A responsibility owed to soldiers like 33-year-old [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2114.7599999999998s)]
*  Sergeant Tom Bates. We were struck with large IED. It was a total devastation strike. Bates [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2121.24s)]
*  miraculously walked away from this mangled Humvee, one of four IED blasts he survived [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2127.4s)]
*  during deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Do you remember feeling the impact in your body? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2133.64s)]
*  Yes. What is that feeling? Just basically like getting hit by a train. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2139.08s)]
*  And you were put back on the front lines? Yes. And that was it? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2143.32s)]
*  When Bates returned home in 2009, his wife Libby immediately saw a dramatic change. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2147.7200000000003s)]
*  I thought something's not absolutely right here. Something's going on for him to just lay there and [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2153.8s)]
*  to sob and be so sad. You know, what do you do for that? How do I help him? He would look at me and [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2160.2000000000003s)]
*  say, if it wasn't for you, I would end it all right now. You know, I'm like, what do you do? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2168.04s)]
*  And what do you say to somebody who says that? You know, I love this man so much. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2175.7200000000003s)]
*  You're going to the VA. You're getting help, but did you feel like you weren't getting [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2184.04s)]
*  answers? Yes. Yes. And so you took it into your own hands and started researching. I knew the way [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2188.36s)]
*  everything had gone and how quick a lot of my neurological issues had progressed that something [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2195.32s)]
*  was wrong. I wanted an answer for it. That led him to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, where [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2201.5600000000004s)]
*  neurologist Dr. Sam Gandy is trying to move beyond diagnosing CTE only in the dead by using scans [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2207.08s)]
*  that test for the disease in the living. By having this during life, this is sort of now gives us [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2214.84s)]
*  for the first time the possibility of estimating the true prevalence of the disease. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2221.48s)]
*  It's important to estimate prevalence so that people can have some sense of what the risk is. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2226.2799999999997s)]
*  In the past year, 36 veterans and athletes have been tested for the disease here. Tom Bates [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2232.04s)]
*  asked to be part of it. The injection I'm going to give you has a radioactive substance tracer. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2238.6s)]
*  That radioactive tracer, known as T807, clings to those dead clusters of protein known as Tau, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2243.0s)]
*  which are typical markers of the disease. Through the course of a 20-minute PET scan, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2250.68s)]
*  high-resolution images are taken of the brain and then combined with MRI results to get a [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2255.8s)]
*  360-degree picture of whether there are potential signs of CTE. Scan results confirmed what Tom and [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2261.8s)]
*  Libby had long suspected. On the right, we see a normal brain scan with no signs of CTE, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2270.04s)]
*  next to Tom's brain, where Tau deposits possible markers of CTE are bright orange. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2277.32s)]
*  Here, these could be responsible for some of the anxiety and depression that he's [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2283.32s)]
*  suffered and we are concerned that it will progress. My hope is that this study becomes [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2287.96s)]
*  more prominent and gets to more veterans and stuff like that so we can actually get like [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2293.32s)]
*  a reflection of what population might actually have this. All right, I want to just watch you walk. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2297.6400000000003s)]
*  There is no cure for CTE. Dr. Gandhi hopes his trial will lead to drug therapies so he can offer [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2303.08s)]
*  some relief to patients like Tom. Dr. Anne McKee believes some people may be at higher risk of [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2310.36s)]
*  getting the disease than others. While examining NFL star Aaron Hernandez's brain, she identified [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2317.32s)]
*  a genetic biomarker she believes may have predisposed him to CTE, a discovery that could [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2323.88s)]
*  have far-reaching implications on the football field and battlefield. Do you think you'll [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2331.0s)]
*  ever be your old self again? I don't ever see me being my old self again. I think it's just [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2337.2400000000002s)]
*  too far gone. So what's your hope then? Just to not become worse than I am now. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2344.36s)]
*  We've seen a lot of stories about veterans and post-traumatic stress disorder, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2362.6s)]
*  but tonight for the first time we're able to show you new therapies that are changing the lives of [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2367.48s)]
*  vets and their families. Two million Americans have served in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Veterans [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2372.68s)]
*  Administration tells us that one out of five suffers from PTSD. One reason we're seeing so [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2378.8399999999997s)]
*  much of it is because many of our troops have been ordered on combat tours three, four, or even five [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2385.3999999999996s)]
*  times. The VA, overwhelmed by the need, decided to try new treatments that were originally designed [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2391.72s)]
*  for rape victims. Over two months, we were allowed to sit in and listen as our troubled [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2399.32s)]
*  veterans fought the war within. How can you live the life where everyone's afraid of you? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2405.48s)]
*  You know, you go to town and people says that's the crazy vet, don't mess with him. My wife told me [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2412.92s)]
*  something's got to change or we got to leave. When you try to talk [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2420.04s)]
*  to somebody that hasn't been there, hasn't experienced it, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2423.4s)]
*  they don't understand and so you just kind of get laughed at. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2430.6s)]
*  The 16 men around this table arrived via Afghanistan, Iraq, or both. Some are here [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2435.7200000000003s)]
*  from Vietnam. I see that I do have, you know, the opportunity to pick myself up. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2442.84s)]
*  I'm 63 years old and start all over again. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2453.4s)]
*  They've started over again many times, but their path has led back to isolation, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2460.52s)]
*  drugs, booze, and suicide attempts. Now they're in the VA hospital in Little Rock, Arkansas, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2465.7200000000003s)]
*  where they will live for eight weeks to break through the emotions that have derailed their lives. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2472.36s)]
*  Depression, anxiety, anger, worthlessness, guilt. Guilt? Survivors, guilt. Why me? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2478.68s)]
*  Why am I alive? Why are they not? That's one of the hardest thoughts to deal with, you know. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2490.12s)]
*  Eric Collins was wounded in a rocket attack in Afghanistan. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2499.3999999999996s)]
*  Over a year, 17 of his buddies died. How did you cope with these feelings of anger and depression [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2503.64s)]
*  and guilt when you first got out? Alcohol and lots of it. That's where it started off. Alcohol [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2513.16s)]
*  led to my depression worsening, which led to more substance abuse, crack. Cocaine is my drug of choice. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2521.08s)]
*  So my whole life spiraled downward out of control. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2529.56s)]
*  To take control, Collins volunteered for one of the new therapies called Prolonged Exposure. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2536.7599999999998s)]
*  It forces him to work at remembering every detail of what he's tried to forget. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2542.7599999999998s)]
*  Next thing you hear a loud boom, my ears start ringing. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2549.2400000000002s)]
*  And I wake up, open my eyes, and I'm on the ground. Dr. Kevin Reeder runs the program. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2557.5600000000004s)]
*  How are you feeling at this point? What were you feeling at that time? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2565.2400000000002s)]
*  Anger, I'm scared, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2568.7599999999998s)]
*  feeling pain, my leg, my back, my arm, my whole body. Okay, let's go from the beginning. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2573.0s)]
*  Gotta keep doing this. Next thing I know, I hear a loud boom. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2581.08s)]
*  They call it Prolonged Exposure because Collins will relive the story of the attack [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2589.0s)]
*  five times a session. There's a tape running and he'll listen to his memory throughout the day [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2594.04s)]
*  to break its power. Tell me about Prolonged Exposure therapy. Sure, they've done everything [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2600.7599999999998s)]
*  they can to push these memories away. In the process, they haven't gained a full realization [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2606.12s)]
*  of the impact and the meaning that these stories have on their lives. I like to use the term, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2611.72s)]
*  we're staring the dragon in the eye. Where did these therapies come from? A lot of these therapies [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2615.72s)]
*  came about with survivors of physical or sexual abuse, those types of traumas. What are the [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2621.48s)]
*  similarities? The symptoms, the symptoms, the avoidance, the isolation, the hypervigilance, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2627.88s)]
*  extreme anxiety, irritability, inability to sleep, nightmares, same thing, different sources, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2634.6800000000003s)]
*  but same thing. I can't move my legs, I can't move my arms. What does that do for you? It helps me [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2642.76s)]
*  to get past the guilt, survivor's guilt, and that's a building block. Every time I get through it, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2649.96s)]
*  I get stronger and it helps every time. It's okay to be alive? Yeah. And you weren't sure that was [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2658.04s)]
*  true before? No, I didn't want to be alive. I wanted to, I wanted to be right there with them. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2666.36s)]
*  I mean, all purpose of life was gone. To lose one of your buddies in a firefight, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2672.76s)]
*  you don't want to see that, you don't want to feel that again. And so, yeah, when you get back to the [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2681.16s)]
*  rear, you're pissed off because you don't want to get close to anyone anymore. Anthony Appolito [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2687.08s)]
*  experienced those multiple tours we talked about. He fought for a year in Afghanistan, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2693.0s)]
*  spent one month at home, then went to Iraq and later Afghanistan again. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2698.6s)]
*  The more deployments you get, the more time you spend out there, it just keeps on stacking. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2704.84s)]
*  I mean, the first one, it hurts, but you don't get really time to heal. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2712.52s)]
*  And then another one happens, and another one. On his first tour, Appolito's patrol was ambushed. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2720.2s)]
*  Two buddies died and 20 were wounded. I had no weapon, no one had my back. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2728.44s)]
*  They write about days like that in the other key therapy here called cognitive processing. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2735.48s)]
*  After a trauma or multiple traumas, often a person can believe the world just is a dangerous place. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2741.56s)]
*  And so what we do with CPT, cognitive processing therapy, is they write an impact statement at the [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2748.84s)]
*  beginning of therapy to show them the impact of the trauma on their lives and on their beliefs. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2755.0s)]
*  They read that statement about the trauma to the group, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2761.72s)]
*  and then they discuss how their lives are still held in the grip of war. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2764.76s)]
*  I never had a fear of life. I never had a fear of living. I never had a fear of going to the [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2770.12s)]
*  gas station and getting shot while I'm pumping gas because I needed gas in my car. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2775.24s)]
*  They plow through a workbook that challenges their guilt with statements like, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2780.12s)]
*  I shot a woman in combat, therefore I'm worthless, or my friend was killed by the enemy, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2784.28s)]
*  I'm responsible. Cognitive processing tries to put the war in the past and help them re-examine [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2790.6000000000004s)]
*  who they are today. It's tough. We noticed this on Appolito's workbook. How many of you would go [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2797.32s)]
*  back to a deployed environment with your branch of service right now if that opportunity was [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2805.0s)]
*  available to you? A lot of hands up. Real quick, why are your hands going up so much? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2809.88s)]
*  You miss everything about how hard it was, how bitter you got, how angry and emotional, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2815.4s)]
*  the things you saw. You missed that camaraderie, that brotherhood, your buddy. Yes, that downtime, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2820.84s)]
*  the struggling with things. Man, it's everything, but you miss it. You mourn that. It's weird. It's [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2830.36s)]
*  that intimacy. I will never get that back. None of us will ever get that back. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2836.28s)]
*  Gable Darbone never planned to be part of that brotherhood he mentioned. In 2001, he was out of [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2843.2400000000002s)]
*  high school headed to college, but then 9-11 pushed him to an Army recruiter instead. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2849.0800000000004s)]
*  My mom, I remember she was crying in the kitchen. She goes, Gable, you don't know what it's like [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2855.6400000000003s)]
*  for those boys coming back from Vietnam, how hard they had it and what they came back with. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2860.04s)]
*  I said, Mom, it's different though. We got attacked. We got attacked. I said, I'm volunteering. I said, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2866.7599999999998s)]
*  I'll take anything. You know, I'm willing to give my life. That's how strongly I felt. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2871.72s)]
*  Darbone was one of the most thoughtful people we met. He served in Afghanistan and Iraq. One day, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2881.4s)]
*  his unit was clearing a house. It exploded and two buddies were burned. You get angry, get mad. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2888.28s)]
*  You know, we get very angry and we took it out on certain people, you know, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2896.6800000000003s)]
*  and you enjoyed it at the time. You did. You did things to Iraqis that you're not proud of. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2904.1200000000003s)]
*  Of course, but that was surviving emotionally, mentally. I was never a violent man. I became [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2909.96s)]
*  different slowly. We all have that instinct, that survival instinct, and that survival instinct [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2919.88s)]
*  is very real. At home, the survival instinct didn't let go. Darbone was like most other vets here. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2929.0s)]
*  Certain triggers brought the instinct back. The smell of diesel returned him to his combat outpost. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2936.28s)]
*  Crowds made him fearful. I started isolating. I couldn't do anything. My dad had to come over [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2942.84s)]
*  and mow my lawn. Mama had to come over and pay my bills. I just, I wouldn't leave my house for a day [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2947.7200000000003s)]
*  or two. I didn't want to make small talk. I didn't want somebody to ask me, hey, how you doing? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2952.84s)]
*  I didn't like those words. You know, I just, I got very secluded, like a recluse. For nine years, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2957.6400000000003s)]
*  Darbone told himself he was okay or would be okay, and then the folks at work urged him to get help. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2963.72s)]
*  This was Darbone after seven weeks of self-examination as they all prepared to go home. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2971.3999999999996s)]
*  When I went in, I had a heart, and I volunteered. I don't blame nothing on anybody. I don't blame [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2977.72s)]
*  nothing on myself. I don't blame nothing on my leaders. In fact, I had good leaders. I blame [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2988.84s)]
*  nothing on the Army. I think it's just the way it is, and it sucks. I hate it. I hate it. I don't want to go home. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=2993.56s)]
*  You all right? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3006.76s)]
*  She kissed me, you all right? She kissed me, you all right? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3008.76s)]
*  You all right? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3012.76s)]
*  People always ask me when I came back, so what do I tell my boyfriend when he comes back, or [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3018.1200000000003s)]
*  how do I approach this to my son? I say when he starts talking, just listen. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3022.76s)]
*  Yeah, don't judge it. Just listen. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3025.88s)]
*  There is probably a soldier or a Marine sitting alone watching this on television right now. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3039.4s)]
*  Thousands of them, I might imagine. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3047.8s)]
*  And to them, you would say what? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3050.12s)]
*  I hope you can find the courage to get help, because all you're doing is killing yourself. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3053.16s)]
*  And you don't have to live like that. There is good people in this world that are willing to help you, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3059.16s)]
*  and it's been the hardest thing for me to do, but I wouldn't have changed coming here for the world. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3065.16s)]
*  In our two months here, 28 men sat around the table. Three couldn't endure it and dropped out. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3071.16s)]
*  The VA finds that nationwide, about 77 percent graduate from this with a drop in their PTSD symptoms. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3079.7999999999997s)]
*  It's progress, but they also have a saying around here. There is no cure. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3087.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't think there is a cure for what we're talking about. We're talking about living, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3093.7999999999997s)]
*  and putting people more in touch with their lives, and emotions, and good days and bad days. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3097.7999999999997s)]
*  This isn't cancer. We can't go get it. We have to teach people that they can live [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3103.7999999999997s)]
*  with this and live a valued life, a life they want. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3109.4s)]
*  After eight weeks here, how are you doing? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3112.92s)]
*  How am I doing? I don't know yet. That's an honest answer. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3116.6000000000004s)]
*  But I know deep down inside, things will work themselves out. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3123.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh9TiIFgXFI&t=3138.76s)]
