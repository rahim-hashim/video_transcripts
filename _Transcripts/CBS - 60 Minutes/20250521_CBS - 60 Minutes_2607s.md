# China's Spies; The Future of Warfare; Sounds of Cajun Country | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q)
*  What has this 76-year-old retired historian been doing in the United States? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Were you spying for the Chinese government? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=12.32s)]
*  According to U.S. intelligence, he was part of a massive network of covert agents recruited [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=14.72s)]
*  by China to spy for its Ministry of State Security. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=20.2s)]
*  This is in scale and in scope and in brazenness the biggest espionage operation against the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=25.8s)]
*  U.S. in its history. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Palmer Luckey may not look like your typical defense industry executive, but the 32-year-old [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=37.0s)]
*  billionaire is the founder of Andrel, whose line of autonomous weapons is powered by artificial [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=42.68s)]
*  intelligence. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=49.24s)]
*  It's a scary idea to some people. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=50.24s)]
*  It's a scary idea, but that's the world we live in. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=52.0s)]
*  I'd say it's a lot scarier, for example, to imagine a weapon system that doesn't have [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=54.12s)]
*  any level of intelligence at all. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=58.76s)]
*  You need no passport to enter Cajun country, but it's an exotic land like nowhere else, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=63.28s)]
*  home to a cuisine, a language, a landscape, even a pacing all its own. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=68.72s)]
*  And then there's the singular sound. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=74.64s)]
*  What defines the Cajun sound? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=77.72s)]
*  Typically, Cajun music has a Cajun accordion, fiddle, sung in Cajun French, they play two [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=79.16000000000001s)]
*  step and waltzes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  It's got a very unique rhythm, a very syncopated rhythm that you don't hear in a lot of other [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  kinds of music. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=89.64s)]
*  It's the syncopation that drives the music. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=90.64s)]
*  And it has the hauntingness about it, the music, and it's just got soul, you know? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=92.82000000000001s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=99.92s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=101.44s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=102.72s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonzi. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=103.92s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm Nora O'Donnell. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=107.84s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelly. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=109.2s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=110.72s)]
*  According to the latest assessment from America's intelligence agencies, China remains the most [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=122.0s)]
*  active and persistent cyber threat to the U.S. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=128.24s)]
*  Its hackers have infiltrated the U.S. government, the private sector, and critical infrastructure [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  like water systems and power grids. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=137.68s)]
*  Hacking, however, has not replaced Beijing's pursuit of old-fashioned human intelligence. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=140.56s)]
*  China's Communist Party remains intent on leveraging a worldwide network of covert agents [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  to monitor and influence events outside its own borders and to surveil and intimidate Chinese [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=152.8s)]
*  dissidents right here in America. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  Tonight, you'll hear about why China spies are on the rise and what happens when one gets caught. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=162.32s)]
*  This is, in scale and in scope and in brazenness, the biggest espionage operation against the U.S. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=169.92s)]
*  in its history. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=177.84s)]
*  Jim Lewis is a former U.S. diplomat whose direct experience with China's intelligence agencies [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=179.92s)]
*  spans more than 30 years. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=186.24s)]
*  He says since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, China's spies no longer seem to fear the U.S. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=188.24s)]
*  Why do China's espionage efforts appear to be growing so big, so fast under Xi Jinping? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=198.96s)]
*  Xi Jinping thinks it's China's time to move to the center of the world stage. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  Xi Jinping looks at the West and at the U.S. and says these people are feeble-minded [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  and I'm going to be able to beat them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=216.4s)]
*  It may not be a household name in the U.S., but according to Lewis, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=218.4s)]
*  China's Ministry of State Security, or MSS, is now the largest and most active spy agency in the world. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=222.8s)]
*  In a propaganda video the spy agency posted last year on China's largest social network, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=233.12s)]
*  a voiceover boasts that the MSS senses things before they happen and fights against evil. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=239.68s)]
*  The slick production is a public message to both foreign adversaries [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=246.88s)]
*  and China's own citizens about the ministry's growing power. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=251.6s)]
*  It's sort of the equivalent of the CIA, but it has much greater powers. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=256.32s)]
*  One estimate says the MSS might have 600,000 employees [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=261.2s)]
*  and they are committed to going after the United States. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=266.08s)]
*  We are target number two for them. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=269.52s)]
*  Who's target number one? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=271.6s)]
*  Target number one is China's own people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=272.56s)]
*  When Xi Jinping wakes up screaming in the middle of the night, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=274.8s)]
*  he's really worried that the Chinese Communist Party was on the path [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=277.68s)]
*  that the Soviet Communist Party was on. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=281.76s)]
*  Lewis says to maintain absolute power at home, President Xi looks abroad. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=284.48s)]
*  Xi Jinping probably remembers that a lot of revolutions start outside the home country [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=290.64s)]
*  and he doesn't want that to happen to China. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=295.76s)]
*  So there's a huge effort to pay attention to the expatriate population. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=297.92s)]
*  One way Beijing paid attention, according to the FBI, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=303.04s)]
*  was to secretly open an overseas Chinese police station [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  right in the middle of New York City. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=310.96s)]
*  It was discovered in 2022, hidden among businesses [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  in a commercial building in Manhattan's Chinatown. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=317.76s)]
*  While Chinese expats could renew government documents there like driver's licenses, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=321.28s)]
*  federal prosecutors said the main purpose of the outpost [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  was to target and harass Chinese dissidents. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=330.48s)]
*  They've done it in the Netherlands, they've done it in Canada, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=334.0s)]
*  but the idea that you'd open a police station in another country, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=336.88s)]
*  that's a signal disrespect of the sovereignty of that nation. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  After the station was shut down, two Chinese Americans who allegedly opened it [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  were charged with conspiracy to act as unregistered foreign agents of China. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=351.12s)]
*  In total, over the last five years, the Department of Justice has indicted more than 140 people [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=357.44s)]
*  for felonies related to harassment, hacking, and spying for China within the U.S. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  And one of the accused worked for the governor of New York. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=371.28s)]
*  Federal prosecutors allege a former top aide to Kathy Hochul named Linda Sun [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=376.08s)]
*  accepted millions of dollars to influence who the governor met with [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=381.76s)]
*  and what she said about China. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=386.16s)]
*  Sun and her husband, who have pled not guilty, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=388.48s)]
*  owned a multi-million dollar home on Long Island and a condo in Hawaii. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=391.68s)]
*  Having a Ferrari in two multi-million dollar houses is a bad idea. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=397.04s)]
*  Or a government employee. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=401.20000000000005s)]
*  Everyone leaves a record. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=402.72s)]
*  Some records are more flamboyant than others. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  Flamboyant is not a word that comes to mind when you meet Xujun Wang, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=408.0s)]
*  the 76-year-old retired historian came to the U.S. from China in 1994 [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=413.2s)]
*  as a visiting scholar at Columbia University. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=419.36s)]
*  In New York, home to more exiled Chinese activists than any other city in the world, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=423.12s)]
*  Wang helped found a group that met regularly and was dedicated to democracy in China. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  In the 2010s, the overseas democracy movement was gaining momentum, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=438.08s)]
*  and I was eager to be a part of it and promote democracy. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=441.92s)]
*  What was your specific role in the pro-democracy community in Flushing Queens? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=445.68s)]
*  I was assigned the role of vice president, secretary general for publicity and events. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=453.04s)]
*  All kinds of events. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=458.0s)]
*  While Xujun Wang became a trusted member of the Chinese dissident community here in New York, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  he kept another role secret. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=466.56s)]
*  For almost 20 years, he was spying for China's Ministry of State Security. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=469.04s)]
*  Did you take notes about who attended these meetings and what they said? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=475.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  When did you start sharing that information with China's largest intelligence group? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=481.92s)]
*  That is a very big misunderstanding. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=490.32000000000005s)]
*  In 2022, Xujun Wang was indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=492.96000000000004s)]
*  for sharing dissidents' names, contact information, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=498.64s)]
*  and private conversations at the direction of the MSS for 17 years. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  When we spoke with him in February through an interpreter, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=508.88s)]
*  he was at times combative and disputed basic facts of his case. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=511.76s)]
*  So we eventually asked Mr. Wang point blank. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  Were you spying for the Chinese government? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  No. Throughout the entire trial, they were very careful. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=523.52s)]
*  They never used the word spy. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=527.28s)]
*  Just look at the record and you'll see that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=529.52s)]
*  We did. And while lying to 60 Minutes may not be a crime, lying to the FBI is. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=532.48s)]
*  Mr. Wang repeatedly told federal agents he had no contact with the Ministry of State Security. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  But according to federal prosecutors, he met with these MSS officers in China, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  and they offered him plane tickets and helped his family with a business dispute. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=552.64s)]
*  In 2021, someone claiming to be from the MSS showed up at Mr. Wang's door [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=557.36s)]
*  to help delete communications from his computer that might incriminate him. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=563.6s)]
*  Video from the encounter showed he welcomed the man's help. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=568.48s)]
*  Unfortunately for Mr. Wang, the Chinese operative was actually an undercover FBI agent. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=572.72s)]
*  Mr. Wang had pled not guilty. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=580.56s)]
*  This past August, he was convicted of making false statements, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=583.52s)]
*  illegally possessing democracy activists' identification, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=587.92s)]
*  and acting as an unregistered foreign agent of China. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  Our position has always been that he never had the intent to be an agent of the Chinese government. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=596.96s)]
*  Mr. Wang's lawyers, Zachary Margolis Onoma and Kevin Tung, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=603.1999999999999s)]
*  admit their client was in touch with Chinese intelligence. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=606.96s)]
*  But they argue he didn't break the law and claim FBI agents went after him [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=610.8s)]
*  once they were unable to recruit him for the U.S. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=616.64s)]
*  They were hoping he would roll over and identify handlers higher up the food chain. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=620.4s)]
*  No, he did not do so. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  And they felt a little vindictive and angry and frustrated about their inability [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=626.8s)]
*  to stop higher up actual espionage. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=631.12s)]
*  And they turned him into this fall guy. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=634.4799999999999s)]
*  But when you look at the reality, he didn't have any access to top secret information. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=636.88s)]
*  All he passed over is the attendance sheet of the democracy movement. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=642.8000000000001s)]
*  Those information are available in public. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=648.48s)]
*  People's names that attend a private event are not public. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=651.6s)]
*  They're only made public. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  Wow, so in this case... [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=656.08s)]
*  Can we hone in on that? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=656.96s)]
*  There's no evidence of any harm to the United States' interests [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=658.4s)]
*  or to democracy movement interests from anything that he did. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=661.84s)]
*  Democracy! [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=665.28s)]
*  Anna Young Chung disagrees. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=667.6s)]
*  She testified against Mr. Wang in court. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=670.16s)]
*  The pro-democracy activist's name and contact information, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=674.0s)]
*  along with 63 others, was found in Mr. Wang's luggage when he returned to New York [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=678.24s)]
*  from a trip to China in 2019. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=684.16s)]
*  Did you ever imagine that Mr. Wang was one of the people who was reporting [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=687.92s)]
*  what you were doing and others back to China? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=693.84s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=696.88s)]
*  Did you lose sleep over it? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I also make sure my door chain was on all the time at night [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=699.2800000000001s)]
*  because you never know. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=705.44s)]
*  Born in Hong Kong, Ms. Young Chung is now a U.S. citizen and professor of biology. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  She organizes demonstrations for the Hong Kong democracy movement in the U.S., [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=714.96s)]
*  where she's become increasingly wary of who might be watching. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=720.16s)]
*  I believe they are collecting information. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=724.9599999999999s)]
*  What kind of information? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=727.04s)]
*  Like what are we doing, what exactly what we are saying in the protest, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=728.16s)]
*  and how many people are showing up there, things like that. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=732.0s)]
*  And collecting that information for whom? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=735.28s)]
*  For Beijing. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=737.92s)]
*  Why do you think China goes to such lengths to spy on pro-democracy activists here in the U.S.? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=739.68s)]
*  This is their tactics, right? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=747.36s)]
*  They try to silence you, harass you, or intimidate you so that you stop what you're doing. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=749.04s)]
*  They want to cripple me and cripple my ability to advocate for Hong Kong. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=755.04s)]
*  Anna Kwok now runs the pro-democracy organization that Anna Young Chung co-founded. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=759.76s)]
*  Because of her outspoken activism, the Hong Kong government [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  has placed a $130,000 bounty on her head. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=771.28s)]
*  So every single day I wake up, I open my social media, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=776.16s)]
*  and then I would see people talking about how if I keep talking here in the United States, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=779.04s)]
*  they will come kidnap me and take my body to the Chinese consulate so that they can send me back to China. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=784.3199999999999s)]
*  How are you viewed by the Chinese government? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=790.88s)]
*  If I do go back to Hong Kong, it's going to be life imprisonment. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  So basically they see me as a traitor, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=796.7199999999999s)]
*  as someone who betrays the Chinese government and the Hong Kong government. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=798.9599999999999s)]
*  And what's the crime you've committed? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=803.28s)]
*  They think that fighting for democracy, wanting a say in our own future, is a crime. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=805.44s)]
*  The United States is known as the land of the free. Do you feel free here? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=811.2s)]
*  Honestly, with China's long arm repression, it's difficult to feel free anywhere in the world. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=815.6s)]
*  The thing about the Chinese government is that you can leave the country, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=820.4000000000001s)]
*  you can leave the territory, but you can never actually leave their governance. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=824.1600000000001s)]
*  After we met her, Anna Kwok's father and brother were arrested in Hong Kong. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=828.24s)]
*  She is currently seeking political asylum in the U.S. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=833.92s)]
*  In March, the Trump administration announced sanctions against officials in Hong Kong [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=837.52s)]
*  who have targeted her and 18 other prominent activists living abroad. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=842.16s)]
*  As for Xu Junwang, on April 14th, a federal judge sentenced him to three years supervised release. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=847.68s)]
*  He spared Mr. Wang prison time because of health problems, including cognitive decline. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=855.04s)]
*  But the judge reiterated he had committed serious crimes against the U.S. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=861.28s)]
*  He was an agent. He worked with the Chinese government to identify targets for them to [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=866.56s)]
*  surveil and compromise. According to China analyst Jim Lewis, there's still no substitute for on the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  ground human intelligence, even if Mr. Wang was an expendable asset for China's top spy agency. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=878.72s)]
*  Not exactly James Bond. Definitely not James Bond. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=887.76s)]
*  Definitely not. That's the scary part, though, is that the Chinese are very good. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=891.52s)]
*  And so he was not number one on the list of assets to protect. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=897.52s)]
*  That means there are other assets who are being protected. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=903.36s)]
*  By now, we've all heard about Elon Musk's efforts to reshape the U.S. government. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=914.48s)]
*  But tonight, we'll introduce you to another tech billionaire, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=919.68s)]
*  one who set his sights on radically changing the way the Pentagon buys and uses weapons. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=923.52s)]
*  His name is Palmer Luckey, and he's the founder of Andrel, a California defense products company. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=929.6s)]
*  Luckey says for too long, the U.S. military has relied on overpriced and outdated technology. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=936.24s)]
*  He argues a Tesla has better AI than any U.S. aircraft, and a Roomba vacuum has better autonomy [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=942.4s)]
*  than most of the Pentagon's weapons systems. So Andrel is making a line of autonomous weapons [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=949.52s)]
*  that operate using artificial intelligence, no human required. Some international groups [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=955.4399999999999s)]
*  have called those types of weapons killer robots. But Palmer Luckey says it is the future of warfare. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=961.5999999999999s)]
*  I've always said that we need to transition from being the world police to being the world gun store. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=969.68s)]
*  Do we want to be the world's gun store? I think so. I think we have to. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=975.04s)]
*  Says the guy who sells weapons. See, I agree it sounds self-fulfilling, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=977.76s)]
*  but you have to remember I also got into this industry because I believe that. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=982.4s)]
*  Palmer Luckey isn't your typical defense industry executive. His daily uniform, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=986.4s)]
*  flip flops and Hawaiian shirt, is more suited for Margaritaville than the military. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=992.08s)]
*  But the 32-year-old billionaire is the founder of Andrel, whose line of American-made autonomous [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=997.36s)]
*  weapons looks like it came straight out of a sci-fi movie and whose slick marketing videos [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1003.84s)]
*  wouldn't be out of place in one. There's the Road Runner, a twin turbo jet-powered drone [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1009.9200000000001s)]
*  interceptor that can take off, identify and strike. If it doesn't find a target, it can land and try [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1017.0400000000001s)]
*  again. Andrel also makes headsets which allow soldiers to see 360 degrees in combat. And there's [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1026.88s)]
*  this. It's an electromagnetic warfare system that can be programmed to jam enemy systems knocking [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1035.44s)]
*  out drone swarms. It's not some futuristic fantasy. Andrel's systems are already being [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1042.8000000000002s)]
*  used by the U.S. military and in the war in Ukraine. We shouldn't be sending our people [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1049.1200000000001s)]
*  to stand in other countries putting our men and women, our sons and daughters at risk [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1054.32s)]
*  for the sovereignty of other nations. So you'd rather have an American-made product in their [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1060.96s)]
*  hands than our soldiers over there? Absolutely. Every time. And I think that that's one of the [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1065.9199999999998s)]
*  reasons that autonomy is so powerful. Right now, there's so many weapon systems that require manning. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1069.76s)]
*  If I can have one guy commanding and controlling a hundred aircraft, that's a lot easier than having [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1074.8s)]
*  to have a pilot in every single one. And it puts a lot fewer American lives at risk. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1080.88s)]
*  To be clear, autonomy does not mean remote control. Once an autonomous weapon is programmed and given [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1086.96s)]
*  a task, it can use artificial intelligence for surveillance or to identify, select and engage [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1093.8400000000001s)]
*  targets. No operator needed. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1101.04s)]
*  It's a scary idea to some people. It's a scary idea, but I mean, that's the world we live in. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1108.8799999999999s)]
*  I'd say it's a lot scarier, for example, to imagine a weapon system that doesn't have any [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1112.8s)]
*  level of intelligence at all. There's no moral high ground in making a landmine that can't tell [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1118.0s)]
*  the difference between a school bus full of children and Russian armor. It's not a question [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1121.52s)]
*  between smart weapons and no weapons. It's a question between smart weapons and dumb weapons. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1124.48s)]
*  Lucky showed us how those so-called smart weapons can be synchronized on Andrew's AI platform. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1129.6s)]
*  It's called Lattice. Lattice collects data from various sensors and sources, including satellites, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1136.1599999999999s)]
*  drones, radar, and cameras, allowing, he says, the AI to analyze move assets and execute missions [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1142.8799999999999s)]
*  faster than a human. If you are having to require the human operator to actually map every single [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1151.84s)]
*  action and say, hey, do this, if that, then this, it would take so long to manage it that you would [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1158.08s)]
*  be better off just remotely piloting it. It's the AI on board all these weapons that makes it [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1163.04s)]

*  trust it. It's going to go rogue. I would say that it is something to be aware of, but in the grand [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1172.72s)]
*  scheme of things, things to be afraid of, there's things that I'm much more terrified of. And I'm a [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1180.1599999999999s)]
*  lot more worried about evil people with mediocre advances in technology than AI deciding that it's [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1184.24s)]
*  going to wipe us all out. Lucky says all Andrew's weapons have a kill switch that allow a human [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1191.2s)]
*  operator to intervene if needed. But the secretary general of the United Nations has called legal [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1196.72s)]
*  autonomous weapons, quote, politically unacceptable and morally repugnant. When people say to you, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1202.8s)]
*  look, it's evil. How do you respond to that? I usually don't bother because if I am going to [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1209.68s)]
*  argue with them, I usually poke it. I'm like, okay, so do you think that NATO should be armed with [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1216.3200000000002s)]
*  squirt guns or slingshots? How about sternly worded letters? Would you like that? Would you like it if [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1220.8s)]
*  NATO just, they just have a bunch of guys sitting at typewriters, a thousand monkeys writing letters [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1226.48s)]
*  to Vladimir Putin, begging him to not invade Ukraine. Our entire society exists because of a [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1231.04s)]
*  credible backstop of violence threatened by the United States and our allies all over the world. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1236.48s)]
*  And thank goodness for it. It might sound flip, but part of Palmer Lucky's philosophy is that [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1241.28s)]
*  autonomous weapons ultimately promote peace by scaring adversaries away. My position has been [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1247.3600000000001s)]
*  that the United States needs to arm our allies and partners around the world so that they can be [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1255.1200000000001s)]
*  prickly porcupines that nobody wants to step on. Nobody wants to, to bite them. In your mind, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1260.48s)]
*  is it enough just to have all these things as deterrent or do they have to be deployed and used? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1266.4s)]
*  They have to believe that you can use them. By the end of this year, Andrew says it will have [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1272.48s)]
*  secured more than $6 billion in government contracts worldwide. When you first came into [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1277.2800000000002s)]
*  this space and you're a tech guy in a Hawaiian shirt and you're walking into the Pentagon, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1283.92s)]
*  maybe in flip-flops, I don't know, were you welcomed with open arms? There were a very small [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1289.0400000000002s)]
*  number of people who welcomed me with open arms and everyone else thought that I was nuts. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1295.2s)]
*  Nuts because there hasn't been a new company in the defense industry in a significant way [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1299.28s)]
*  since the end of the Cold War. For decades, five defense contractors called the Primes have [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1304.48s)]
*  dominated the industry. Typically, the Primes present an idea to the Pentagon. If the Pentagon [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1310.4s)]
*  buys it, the government pays for the company to develop it, even if it's late or goes over budget. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1316.72s)]
*  Lucky started Andrel to flip that procurement structure on its head. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1323.44s)]
*  The idea behind Andrel was to build not a defense contractor, but a defense product company. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1327.76s)]
*  What's the difference? Contractors, in general, are paid to do work, whether or not it succeeds. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1334.88s)]
*  A product company has a very different mentality. You're putting in your own money, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1340.96s)]
*  you're putting in your own time. My vision was to build a company that would show up, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1344.72s)]
*  not with a PowerPoint describing how taxpayers are going to pay all my bills, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1349.44s)]
*  but with a working product where all the risk has been baked out. It will work for enough things [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1353.44s)]
*  that you can save our country hundreds of billions of dollars a year. It may not surprise you that [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1358.72s)]
*  Palmer Lucky's father was a car salesman. His mother took on the role of homeschooling him [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1363.6000000000001s)]
*  and his three sisters. Lucky says he was fascinated by electronics and spent a lot of time tinkering [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1368.96s)]
*  in his parents' garage in Long Beach, California. By age 19, his tinkering turned into Oculus, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1375.52s)]
*  the virtual reality company. And at 21, Palmer Lucky fulfilled every young founder's dream [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1382.6399999999999s)]
*  when he sold Oculus to Facebook for $2 billion. The wonder kid graced the covers of magazines, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1389.36s)]
*  but two years later, he was fired from Facebook. Why did you get fired? Well, you know, everyone's [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1396.4s)]
*  got a different story, but it boils down to I gave $9,000 to a political group that was [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1403.12s)]
*  for Donald Trump and against Hillary Clinton. To be a Trump supporter in 2016, you know, this was [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1408.7199999999998s)]
*  at the height of the election insanity and derangement in Silicon Valley. And so I think [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1414.0s)]
*  that a lot of people thought back then that you could, you could just fire a Trump supporter. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1419.4399999999998s)]
*  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has denied that Lucky was fired for his political views. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1424.8s)]
*  What do you think now when you see those tech leaders, Mark Zuckerberg, lined up behind [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1430.4s)]
*  President Trump now at his inauguration? I am inclined to let every single one of them get away [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1434.8000000000002s)]
*  with it. Look, what do you mean get away with it? Coming around to a point of view that is more [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1439.52s)]
*  aligned with the American people broadly, I think is good for the country. I think it is not good [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1445.1200000000001s)]
*  for you to have techno corpo elites that are radically out of step with where the American [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1449.8400000000001s)]
*  people are. In 2017, Lucky says he left Silicon Valley with hundreds of millions of dollars in [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1456.4s)]
*  the bank and a chip on his shoulder. I was fired at the height of my career. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1462.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, my gears were ground and I really wanted to prove that I was somebody, that I was not a [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1468.5600000000002s)]
*  one-hit wonder and that I still had it in me to do big things. He says he thought about starting [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1473.2s)]
*  companies to combat obesity or fix the prison system, but ultimately decided to break into [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1479.2s)]
*  the defense industry. Have you run into any people who don't take you seriously because [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1485.04s)]
*  you were never in the military? I don't think so. I think I owe that to the James Bond franchise. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1489.84s)]
*  Everyone in the military has seen James Bond movies and they all like you, right? I'm the [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1497.52s)]
*  wacky gadget man. I'm the guy who types on the computer and pushes up my glasses and then gives [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1504.24s)]
*  them a strange thing to help them accomplish their mission. And this is his laboratory, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1508.72s)]
*  Andrew's 640,000 square foot headquarters in Costa Mesa, California. It's a mix of high-tech [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1513.52s)]
*  carpentry and robotic engineering. A sign on the floor pokes fun at the boss's shoe choice. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1521.12s)]
*  But Lucky wanted to show us something off campus. We hopped in his 1985 Humvee. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1528.4s)]
*  The billionaire told us he also owns a decommissioned Blackhawk helicopter, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1536.16s)]
*  a 48-cruise submarine and a Navy speedboat. In Dana Point, we took a ride 15 minutes off the coast [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1540.88s)]
*  to see the largest weapon in Andrew's arsenal, this submarine. It's called the Dive XL. It's [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1549.2s)]
*  about the size of a school bus and works autonomously. It's not remote controlled by [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1556.16s)]
*  this computer. It's doing it on the brain on the submarine itself. So if I told you to go off and [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1561.3600000000001s)]
*  perform some mission, it's months long, like go to this target, listen for this particular signature. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1566.56s)]
*  And if you see this signature run, if you see this one hide, if you see this one follow it, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1571.84s)]
*  it can do that all on its own without being detected, without communicating with it. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1577.52s)]
*  Andrew says the Dive XL can travel a thousand miles fully submerged. Australia has already [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1582.24s)]
*  invested $58 million in the subs to help defend its seas from China. But Andrew's most anticipated [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1589.04s)]
*  weapon has been closely guarded until this month. Hidden inside this hanger, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1597.76s)]
*  Andrew's unmanned fighter jet called Fury. There is no cockpit or stick or rudder because there's [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1605.28s)]
*  no pilot. The idea is that you're building a robotic fighter jet that is flying with manned [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1612.32s)]
*  fighters and is doing what you ask it to do, recommending things that be done, taking risks [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1619.2s)]
*  that you don't want human pilots to take. Fury represents a big turning point for the company. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1624.1599999999999s)]
*  Andrew was viewed by some inside the defense industry as a tech bro startup until it beat out [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1629.84s)]
*  several of the prime defense contractors to make an unmanned fighter jet for the air force. Fury [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1635.76s)]
*  is scheduled to take its first test flight this summer. If selected by the Pentagon, it, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1642.0s)]
*  like all Andrew products, will be produced in the U.S. The war games say we're going to run out of [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1647.84s)]
*  munitions in eight days in a fight with China. If we have to fight Iran and China and Russia all at [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1653.36s)]
*  the same time, we are screwed. If we go to war, right? Your version of what Andrew's place is [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1657.84s)]
*  in a conflict. How do you view it? I think what we're going to be doing is first connecting a lot [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1665.36s)]
*  of these systems that otherwise would not have been talking to one another. We're going to be [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1671.28s)]
*  making large numbers of cruise missiles, large numbers of fighter jets, large numbers of surface [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1674.3999999999999s)]
*  and subsurface systems. I guess I would hope that Andrew is making most of the stuff that's being [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1679.68s)]
*  used on day nine, day 10, day 11, day 100. I think a lot of that is going to be coming out of our [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1684.56s)]
*  factories after everything else is run dry. A closer look at the Fury unmanned fighter jet [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1690.24s)]
*  is an entirely new way of fighting at 60 minutes overtime.com. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1701.28s)]
*  The idea that this country has become one big bland conformist culture, United States of [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1713.28s)]
*  generica. Well, if you're in search of a counterpoint, hang out as we did in the marshy [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1718.6399999999999s)]
*  interior of southern Louisiana. You need no passport to enter Cajun country, but it's an [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1724.0s)]
*  exotic land like nowhere else, home to a cuisine, a language, a landscape, even a pacing all its own. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1729.04s)]
*  And then there's the singular sound. Cajun music and its cousin from across the way, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1735.92s)]
*  Zydeco resists easy description, but it is intoxicatingly catchy, often sung in French [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1741.04s)]
*  and enjoying a most unlikely renaissance. The sun is out and living is easy on the bayous of [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1747.36s)]
*  Louisiana. The fish are jumping. Those are carp and the cypress trees grow high. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1756.0s)]
*  On dry land, the music hangs in the humidity. In Eunice, Louisiana, the Savoy family has lived on [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1765.04s)]
*  this patch of land for eight generations. Music is often a family inheritance down here. And you can [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1772.32s)]
*  think of the Savoy's as the von Trapp clan of Cajun country, Acadiana as it's known. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1779.04s)]
*  Joel is a Grammy winning producer and musician, often accompanied by his brother Wilson, also a Grammy winner. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1784.24s)]
*  Their father, Mark, an accordion maker by day is a prominent musician in his own right, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1795.6s)]
*  as is their mother, Anne, who once recorded with Linda Ronstadt. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1801.28s)]
*  What defines the Cajun sound? Typically, Cajun music has a Cajun accordion, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1807.52s)]
*  fiddle, sung in Cajun French. They play two step and waltzes. It's got a very unique rhythm, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1812.08s)]
*  a syncopated rhythm that you don't hear in a lot of other kinds of music. The syncopation that [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1817.52s)]
*  drives the music. And it has the hauntingness about it, the music, and it just got soul, you know? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1821.4399999999998s)]
*  These sounds are sourced from the unique blend of people that converged on Cajun country over [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1829.6s)]
*  the centuries. Music is obviously born out of this swirl of different cultures. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  The accordion arrived with some part of the population. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1842.8s)]
*  Fiddle arrived with different part of the population. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1847.12s)]
*  The syncopation comes from people that we encountered here, the African Americans, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1850.48s)]
*  the Creoles, the Spanish, things like that. It's also a social music, you know, anytime there's [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1855.1999999999998s)]
*  music there's somebody hanging out, somebody cooking. These things just are part of life, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1861.4399999999998s)]

*  The music is a bit more creative. As we saw, when the sun sets in Acadiana, the volume turns way up. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1869.0400000000002s)]

*  how's New Orleans? I'm like, I don't know. I don't live in New Orleans. I live in southwest [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1928.0800000000002s)]

*  I started playing my songs and she started looking over to her husband going, wow, this is great. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1970.0s)]

*  Most of the people that be in these kind of dances are as far removed from a hipster as [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=1996.88s)]
*  you can possibly imagine. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2000.96s)]

*  of life. You've just sang, you say a lot that's in some of your song lyrics. You want to tell us [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2018.32s)]
*  what it is? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2026.64s)]
*  It means either live your culture or you kill your culture. There's no in between. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2031.2s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2034.96s)]
*  You see this vanishing of cultures, of dialects, of everything to just create this one generic [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2035.76s)]
*  human. And it's really sad to me. So I'm going to get up every day and I'm going to live my culture [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2043.3600000000001s)]

*  Time was Louisiana French could be heard on every street corner, both in Cajun and Creole [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2057.52s)]

*  as the march of Americanization proceeds. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2068.64s)]
*  Imagine still being home and saying, oh, I miss home. It's a very hard feeling to convey. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2071.44s)]
*  I wonder if the language is diminishing, the Cajun music becomes that much more important [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2078.24s)]
*  as this transmitted culture. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2084.24s)]
*  No, without a doubt. There are countless kids who are learning the language just from the music. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2085.28s)]
*  The Cajun story starts in Nova Scotia where this French speaking people led a peaceful life [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2091.84s)]
*  until they didn't. In the middle of the 1700s, the conquering British kicked out the Acadians, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2097.1200000000003s)]
*  shortened to Cajuns. Expelled, they found an improbable home amid the backwaters of French [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2103.6800000000003s)]

*  it would take the kids. They'd put us some life jacket and throw us out the boat to go swim so [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2133.6800000000003s)]
*  they could fish in peace, you know, and she'd make the turn. If you'd see an alligator, mama, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2137.44s)]
*  they got an alligator. You can see him. Yes, ma'am. That is fine. If you can't see him no more, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2142.16s)]
*  let me know. The Cajuns didn't come with much, but they did bring their old French melodies. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2148.08s)]
*  We sing a lot fishing. When we're sitting fish, me and my little girl, my youngest, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2153.2000000000003s)]
*  she likes to sit and sing. So while we're fishing, she sings to the fish to get them to come. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2157.76s)]
*  Long as he brought up fish, well, there's an unwritten rule in Cajun country. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2163.28s)]
*  You can't have the music without the food. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2167.84s)]
*  Joel Savoie and his family invited us into their kitchen. We're cooking some shrimp, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2171.6800000000003s)]
*  etouffé. Etouffé is a French word that means smothered. So we smothered them. Where did you [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2176.88s)]
*  learn from your folks? Yeah. A lot of people say, what's the recipe? I said, I don't know what the [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2182.32s)]
*  recipe is. New York, you can go into a Michelin star restaurant and they've got etouffé and gumbo. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2188.48s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not the same. Not the same. They don't know what they're doing. I propose a toast [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2194.32s)]
*  to my grandmother who lived in this house. And with her lack of gentility, she would always say, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2198.88s)]
*  I read the badger lay, I see to it, I don't bother it. Quit your babbling, sit down and let's stuff [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2205.28s)]
*  ourselves. Here, here. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. The music, the food, the drink, the bon temps, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2210.88s)]
*  the good times, these traditions braid all the communities here, but with slight twists. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2218.96s)]
*  Chubby Carrier's father and grandfather were sharecroppers who played music at night. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2226.0s)]
*  He showed us the difference between the blues heavy zydeco he grew up with [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2231.44s)]
*  in the more country infused Cajun sound. So I took one of my grandfather's songs. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2235.36s)]
*  Now you see, I did all my zydeco. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2243.28s)]
*  That's a zydeco song. Now watch your waltz. Take it to the Cajun. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2247.52s)]
*  You hear that? Then I take that same song and I speed it up, it's going to turn into a zydeco [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2256.8s)]
*  song. Whoa. All in one, brother. Though entwined musically for decades, the black zydeco and the [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2260.8s)]
*  white Cajun scenes couldn't mingle much in the Jim Crow deep south. We first met Chubby at Le [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2268.0s)]
*  Poussière, The Dust, a dance hall in the town of Brow Bridge. He remembers when black bands and [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2274.1600000000003s)]
*  patrons weren't allowed in. I wonder if you thought about what your dad and your grandpa [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2280.48s)]
*  would have been thinking watching you play this venue where they wouldn't have been playing. I [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2285.84s)]
*  mean we can't even step in that club. Like daddy and my grandfather, I want to say this, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2289.6s)]
*  they fought the fight for us, man. Daddy and granddaddy is in heaven looking down going, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2293.8399999999997s)]
*  my son is playing at a white venue that I never thought in a million years that I would ever ever [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2298.16s)]
*  see. But how good it is, how sweet it is, huh? Today the Cajun and zydeco crowd overlap like [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2303.52s)]
*  never before. The music has found new audiences with new sensibilities. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2311.36s)]
*  It feels like a train moving and that's why. Like virtually all the musicians we interviewed, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2324.7200000000003s)]
*  little Nate Williams has seen a surge in popularity. Last year his streaming audience jumped by, get [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2329.36s)]
*  this, more than 3,000 percent. How do you describe your style of zydeco? It's not traditional, is it? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2335.84s)]
*  Very much not traditional, man. It's a fusion. That's that's how I think of it. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2343.52s)]
*  Keyboard synthesizers, a lot of R&B, a lot of R&B. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2347.52s)]
*  Nate learned to play from his father, also a renowned zydeco musician, and he's found pushing [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2355.28s)]
*  musical boundaries is not always frictionless. What's dad say about this? My dad has always been [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2361.28s)]
*  encouraging, but I could see his face sometimes. You know, we'll sit down in the studio, he'll look [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2367.36s)]
*  at me and listen to my stuff. Can we put some more accordion in there? Can we put some more [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2374.4s)]
*  French in there? Can we put this in there? But at the end of the day, you know, we come to some [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2382.2400000000002s)]
*  compromising, understanding that this is you, this is me. And the music has struck a chord beyond [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2386.96s)]
*  Louisiana. Jordan's band tours across the country and internationally. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2395.12s)]
*  We met Jordan, Joel and Wilson after they played a packed show in the red-hooked neighborhood of [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2406.7200000000003s)]
*  Brooklyn, of all places. The band, like us, ponders what precisely is fueling this interest [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2412.0s)]
*  outside Louisiana. They don't speak French, they're not getting the lyrics. What are they [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2422.96s)]
*  connecting to? I wonder that all the time. I really just believe it's the emotion. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2431.28s)]
*  If we play in here, and I'm happy, and we're cutting up, and you can see and feel that good time, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2438.4s)]
*  you're going to feel that good time. Same thing, if the song's horribly sad, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2444.4s)]
*  maybe it makes you feel a little sadness inside of you, and you connect on that emotional level. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2454.0s)]
*  Emotional connection to a sound that, like the accordion itself, can contract and expand. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2459.6800000000003s)]
*  Old melodies in a new era. True music, it's emotive. You're gonna feel it, and that's... [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfRA2gnX1Q&t=2468.2400000000002s)]
