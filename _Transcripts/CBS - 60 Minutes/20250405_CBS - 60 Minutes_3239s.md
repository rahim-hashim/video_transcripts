**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY)
*  The hottest thing in police work these days is the Taser, a device which sends painful [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=0.0s)]
*  jolts of electricity into the human body, throwing muscles into uncontrollable spasms. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=17.76s)]
*  Police see it as a whole new way of controlling people without injuring either themselves [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=23.92s)]
*  or the suspect. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=27.72s)]
*  Frequently the mere sight of a Taser will convince a criminal to give up without a fight. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=29.6s)]
*  It's so effective, police are sometimes too quick to use it, subjecting people to excruciating [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=34.44s)]
*  pain for no good reason. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=39.36s)]
*  Some have even died after being hit by a Taser. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=41.84s)]
*  Whatever you think of Taser after watching this story, you better get used to it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=44.96s)]
*  Taser is now used by more than 16,000 law enforcement agencies in the U.S. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=50.0s)]
*  It all started when two brothers, Rick and Tom Smith, founded Taser International and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=55.28s)]
*  set out to corner the stun gun market. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=60.0s)]
*  We believe in what we are doing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=63.36s)]
*  We have changed the world. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=65.64s)]
*  Very few people can say that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=68.04s)]
*  By Tom Smith's count, more than 500,000 law enforcement officers in the United States [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=70.08s)]
*  now carry Tasers. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=75.8s)]
*  He and his brother Rick have taken what began as a backyard experiment and built it into [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=77.28s)]
*  a policeman's weapon of choice, a device which uses electricity to subdue unruly suspects [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=82.56s)]
*  without having to resort to the blunt force of a billy club or the deadly force of a firearm. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  The idea of using electricity to incapacitate at its core is frankly a beautiful and simplistic [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=95.2s)]
*  idea that rather than causing death or injury to someone, if we can just temporarily take [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=101.92s)]
*  away control of their body and get them under control, it's about as nonviolent as you could [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=107.04s)]
*  get. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  Taser uses compressed gas to fire two small darts attached to copper wires. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=112.52s)]
*  When they pierce the skin, the electric current flows through the body, seizing up the muscles [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  and sending the suspect crashing to the ground screaming in pain. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=122.63999999999999s)]
*  This is a whole new device. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  It's a whole new way to control people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=129.28s)]
*  Jeffrey Alpert has written what to date is the definitive study of Taser use for the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  National Institute of Justice. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=136.0s)]
*  When used properly, a Taser is a very effective tool in law enforcement. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=138.32s)]
*  Well then I guess the question is do police use a Taser properly? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=142.32s)]
*  Well that's the million dollar question. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=146.48s)]
*  Alpert's study found instances of what he calls lazy cop syndrome, using the Taser instead [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  of proper police procedures. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=154.6s)]
*  So the Taser is now the go-to weapon? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  Yes sir. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=159.28s)]
*  We see very often that Taser is what officers turn to very quickly now in an encounter. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=160.68s)]
*  Are they using them too quickly? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=167.36s)]
*  Some are. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  Some are using them way too fast. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  One of the police departments Alpert studied was Austin, Texas, where a police officer [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=173.34s)]
*  was suspended for three days after this traffic stop. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=177.88000000000002s)]
*  I have no idea why you are asking me. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=181.36s)]
*  Step out of the vehicle. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=183.36s)]
*  Take your seatbelt off. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=184.36s)]
*  Step out of the vehicle. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=185.36s)]
*  The driver had been going five miles over the speed limit. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  Step out of the vehicle. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  Step out of the vehicle. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  Put your hands on the vehicle. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  Not to the back of the vehicle. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  Stop. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  Stop. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  Las Vegas was one of the first big city police departments to issue Tasers to cops on the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  beat. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=205.06s)]
*  Marcus Martin, the department's chief Taser instructor, says that in the first year they [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=206.44s)]
*  were used more than twice as often as they are now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=211.16s)]
*  When you consider in 2004 we had 573 uses, we're down to 247 at the end of 2010. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=213.82s)]
*  Does that say officers were too quick to reach for the Taser at first? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=220.85999999999999s)]
*  I can only be frank with you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=225.98s)]
*  I think there might have been those instances, but that's the same with any tool that comes [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=227.66s)]
*  along. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=232.62s)]
*  Again, we have to go back and we have to train that out of those officers. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=233.62s)]
*  With all its high roller entertainment and hard party glitz, Las Vegas may be the only [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=236.26s)]
*  city in America where police end up in a standoff with a suicidal Elvis impersonator. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=241.14s)]
*  And casualties are down on both sides. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=248.14s)]
*  The number of suspects who had to be taken to the hospital after they were arrested has [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  gone down every year since Taser was brought in. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=257.41999999999996s)]
*  And so has the number of policemen injured. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=260.97999999999996s)]
*  Right now, Taser appears to be the best tool out there and it's changed the face of police [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=263.94s)]
*  work forever. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=269.94s)]
*  That's a bold statement. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=271.14s)]
*  That is a bold statement. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=272.14s)]
*  And why do you make a statement like that? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=273.14s)]
*  There's a lot of misinformation out there, but the real information eventually does come [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=275.82s)]
*  out, the truth does come out, that this person is alive today and that person is alive today [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=279.86s)]
*  or this police officer is not harmed today because of this less than lethal device. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=285.66s)]
*  The first Taser was invented by space scientist Jack Kover. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=291.38s)]
*  He designed it to look like a flashlight, fired it using gunpowder, and named it for [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=295.34s)]
*  one of his science fiction heroes, the Thomas A. Swift electric rifle, Taser. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=300.18s)]
*  The Smith brothers struck a deal with Kover and then they re-engineered his weapon. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  They drew straws and went out in the backyard to take the first hits from their new improved [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=311.7s)]
*  Taser. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=316.34000000000003s)]
*  First Tom, then Rick, standing in a pool of water. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=317.68s)]
*  Today they run a worldwide business from their over-the-top headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=321.9s)]
*  which the Smith brothers designed from the ground up as a corporate statement. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=327.78s)]
*  This is an iris scanner. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  Identification is completed. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=333.78s)]
*  Allows access to the building without the need for keys. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  They don't have those at the Pentagon, you know. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=338.9s)]
*  I did not know that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=341.46s)]
*  It is part fortress, part tribute to Star Trek. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=342.46s)]
*  We certainly again wanted that projection of high tech, that we're on a cutting edge, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=346.29999999999995s)]
*  we're making things that are right out of Hollywood, we're the wired version of a Star [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=350.34s)]
*  Trek Taser. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=353.78s)]
*  The Smith brothers may not have invented the Taser, but they certainly turned it into the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=355.1s)]
*  household name it is today. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  They took a device that had been fired by gunpowder and converted it to compressed gas. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=361.06s)]
*  That freed them from all the regulations which governed the use of firearms and turned Taser [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=366.26000000000005s)]
*  into a $100 million a year company. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=371.32000000000005s)]
*  In the eyes of federal regulators, getting rid of the gunpowder converted Taser from [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  a firearm to a run-of-the-mill consumer product. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=378.94s)]
*  That allowed the Smith brothers to corner the market. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  It moved it from a regulated weapon to an unregulated tool that allowed not only police [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=386.38s)]
*  officers but civilians to use them without any kind of mandated training or with any [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=392.74s)]
*  kind of mandated rules. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=397.86s)]
*  The production line turns out 100,000 Tasers a year with a combination of one-of-a-kind [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=400.78000000000003s)]
*  technology and old-fashioned manual assembly. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=406.18s)]
*  All the way down to attaching the darts to their wires. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=410.08s)]
*  How much of a jolt does it put out? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=414.02s)]
*  It's putting out about 2.1 milliamps. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=417.0s)]
*  It's a very, very low current. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=419.64s)]
*  The battery that runs this is basically the same battery that would run a digital camera. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=421.3s)]
*  So while the voltage is high, the amount of electricity or current the Taser puts out [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=424.97999999999996s)]
*  is low. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=429.52s)]
*  And that's the difference between being electrocuted and living to tell about it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm not a huge fan. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=435.76s)]
*  Baltimore Police Commissioner Frederick Bielfield may be Taser's most reluctant customer. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=437.36s)]
*  I recognize, one, the utility of this device. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=442.56s)]
*  It makes the public safer in a lot of situations. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=448.28000000000003s)]
*  It has helped contribute in some measure to reductions of deadly force. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=452.16s)]
*  But you're not a fan. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=458.52000000000004s)]

*  And then there are the tragic but rare cases like that of 17 year old Darryl Turner, who [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=615.0s)]
*  in 2008 was fired for stealing snacks from the grocery store where he worked. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=620.44s)]

*  Now you can see the laser sight of the Taser on his chest and now he's tased. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=644.04s)]
*  But Turner doesn't go down. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=649.3599999999999s)]
*  The darts are too close together and don't incapacitate enough muscles. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=651.54s)]
*  So the police officer keeps tasing him. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=655.88s)]
*  And now he is collapsed on the floor and he never moves again. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=658.84s)]
*  And I think the only explanation is that the electrical shocks from the Taser device caused [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=663.96s)]
*  this young man to have cardiac arrest and die. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=670.2s)]

*  A verdict Taser has asked the judge to set aside. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=677.88s)]
*  Taser has been sued 192 times for allegedly causing injury or death and has lost only [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=681.64s)]
*  one other case. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=687.96s)]
*  Because the Turner case is still in court, the Smith brothers won't talk about it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=690.1s)]
*  But in other cases they argue strenuously against assuming the electric shock is the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=694.4000000000001s)]
*  cause of death. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=699.5400000000001s)]

*  Elijah McClain did nothing wrong. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=969.72s)]
*  The officers don't know that, though. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=972.36s)]
*  The officers know nothing about Elijah McClain. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=974.4000000000001s)]
*  Adams County District Attorney Dave Young, whose jurisdiction covers Aurora, reviewed [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=977.2s)]
*  all the recordings in the case. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=981.32s)]
*  You can see that the officers are at least trying to have a conversation with Elijah [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=983.32s)]
*  McClain. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=986.9200000000001s)]
*  But it's a one-way conversation. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=987.9200000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=988.9200000000001s)]
*  They're not listening to Elijah McClain. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=989.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, they're not listening to Elijah McClain. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=991.48s)]
*  That's correct because they're trying to control the situation. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=993.44s)]
*  It goes from zero to 60 pretty quickly. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=996.16s)]
*  He's pretty articulately saying, I'm an introvert. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=998.56s)]
*  Please don't hurt me. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1002.52s)]
*  I can't breathe. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1003.52s)]
*  And yet the escalation of force continues. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1005.28s)]
*  Well, the escalation started when Elijah McClain didn't stop walking. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1008.28s)]
*  They took it to the next level and said, all right, this person's not complying with our [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1013.1999999999999s)]
*  lawful commands. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1016.64s)]
*  Now we're going to stop and go hands-on. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1018.64s)]
*  The escalation continued. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1021.12s)]
*  McClain's pleading did, too. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1023.12s)]
*  According to their statements and the district attorney, the police and medical workers said [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1024.96s)]
*  they thought the 140-pound McClain wasn't making sense and showed super strength, signs [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1029.2s)]
*  they took not as a struggle to survive, but as symptoms of excited delirium. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1035.3600000000001s)]
*  So, when the ambulance gets here, we're going to go ahead and give him some ketamine. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1040.48s)]
*  All the cops are OK. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1043.44s)]
*  Yes, sounds good. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1044.44s)]
*  Perfect, dude. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1045.44s)]
*  And so, adhering to their protocol, paramedics injected him with a drug called ketamine, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1046.44s)]
*  powerful anesthetic used in hospitals. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1049.92s)]
*  Paramedics gave McClain a ketamine dose for someone closer to twice his weight, according [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1053.76s)]
*  to the family's civil rights lawsuit. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1057.9599999999998s)]
*  He suffered respiratory and cardiac arrest and died three days later. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1060.28s)]
*  His death triggered protests and calls for accountability. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1064.76s)]
*  But district attorney Dave Young chose not to file criminal charges against the officers. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1068.56s)]
*  Now, if the officers came right out and shot Mr. McClain, it would be an easy decision [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1073.8s)]
*  for me, OK? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1078.1999999999998s)]
*  If that's the bar, that seems like an extremely high bar. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1079.9199999999998s)]
*  It was the carotid hold, and the pathologist came in and said he died from strangulation. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1083.24s)]
*  And then I would have to look and say, what the heck is going on here? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1088.32s)]
*  Why did they have to use that amount of force under these circumstances? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1092.1200000000001s)]
*  Let me borrow that sentence from you. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1097.36s)]
*  What the heck is going on here that they had to use that amount of ketamine? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1099.36s)]
*  Why isn't that the same thing? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1103.48s)]
*  They have a policy in the city of the Aurora that says paramedics do this when you have [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1104.84s)]
*  these circumstances, and they follow that policy. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1109.64s)]
*  That policy is now on hold and under review in the wake of McClain's death. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1112.12s)]
*  The county coroner who consulted with police in conducting the autopsy concluded the cause [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1116.76s)]
*  of McClain's death was undetermined because he may have died from a host of possible causes, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1122.28s)]
*  including excited delirium. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1128.3999999999999s)]
*  And that possibility, district attorney Dave Young said, convinced him he could not win [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1130.34s)]
*  a homicide case against the officers. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1134.4399999999998s)]
*  Did the excited delirium being included in the autopsy make your job easier or harder [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1137.08s)]
*  in terms of making your final determination? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1141.76s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1145.24s)]
*  And the answer to that question is it made it easier because you're missing a key element [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1146.2s)]
*  to a homicide investigation. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1153.24s)]
*  You can't file a homicide charge without cause of death. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1154.8000000000002s)]
*  The term excited delirium, not all doctors agree that it even exists as a condition. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1158.44s)]
*  Do you see problems in that or do you think it's an airtight term? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1164.88s)]
*  Well, I think it's science. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1169.1200000000001s)]
*  I think there's always, you know, in pathology, there's a best guess for lack of a better term. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1170.44s)]
*  When you listen to the audio of the arrest, do you hear him being delirious? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1176.8400000000001s)]
*  When I hear him on that tape, I hear him completely sane, completely in his right mind. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1181.8400000000001s)]
*  I truly believe was in his right mind up until the time he passed out. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1188.4s)]
*  Elijah McClain's case is not an isolated one. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1192.48s)]
*  A 2018 review of 66 studies and articles referencing excited delirium found it was cited in more than 10 percent of deaths in police custody. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1195.68s)]
*  Though it is supported by some in law enforcement and emergency medicine, it is not recognized by the American Medical Association, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1205.5600000000002s)]
*  the World Health Organization or the American Psychiatric Association. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1213.44s)]
*  Paul Applebaum, who oversees changes to psychiatry's main diagnostic manual, says excited delirium is bad science [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1218.3999999999999s)]
*  based on faulty studies that grew out of the 1980s cocaine epidemic. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1227.0s)]
*  Excited delirium is a perplexing term from my perspective. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1232.3999999999999s)]
*  Perplexing what? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1237.04s)]
*  It doesn't correspond to any discrete reality out there in the world. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1238.12s)]
*  So it's a catch all phrase? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1244.84s)]
*  It's a wastebasket phrase. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1247.16s)]
*  It also had utility for the police since so many of the early cases and some of the continuing cases occur in police custody and result in death. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1249.0800000000002s)]
*  It's a way of explaining what happened without necessarily bearing responsibility for it. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1263.72s)]
*  If there's a bad outcome, you have a ready excuse at hand. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1270.76s)]
*  And as Applebaum discovered, it is disproportionately associated with one sector of the population. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1275.0s)]
*  They tend to be young, they tend to be male and they tend to be African-American. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1280.96s)]
*  So what are people applying excited delirium to? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1286.76s)]
*  Large numbers of people who are agitated and hard to control, often hard for the police to control. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1289.72s)]
*  Should it be sufficient to just say they're hard to control? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1298.32s)]
*  You might want to go beyond that and ask why they're agitated. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1301.32s)]
*  Is this somebody who's intoxicated? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1305.16s)]
*  Is this somebody who is experiencing a psychotic episode? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1307.8s)]
*  Or is this somebody who's just afraid, who's been confronted by the police on a dark street at night, minding his own business and is suddenly fearful for his life? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1312.44s)]
*  While the debate over the validity of excited delirium continues, even some of its proponents say it has been applied too often. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1322.48s)]
*  Creating a demand for a quick acting solution and triggering a rise in the use of the drug ketamine, which can be deadly during arrests. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1330.2s)]
*  Over the last several years, there's been almost an exponential growth in the use of ketamine in exactly these kinds of encounters on the street with the police, with the EMTs then called to help subdue the person. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1338.96s)]
*  In Colorado, for example, in the last two and a half years, 900 doses of ketamine. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1351.3600000000001s)]
*  Does that seem excessive? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1355.96s)]
*  That seems astounding. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1356.96s)]
*  Resulting, Colorado data shows in nearly a 17 percent rate of complications. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1358.8s)]
*  Using ketamine for excited delirium became more widespread after a 2009 paper by the American College of Emergency Physicians and a 2013 study co-authored by Jeffrey Ho, former medical director of EMS at Hennepin Health Care in Minneapolis. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1365.2s)]
*  In a blurring of roles, Ho is also a sheriff's deputy in rural Minnesota. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1381.72s)]
*  In Minneapolis, a city review found a 3000 percent increase in the use of ketamine during police encounters from 2010 through 2017, and the jump has led to mistakes. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1387.0s)]
*  I was trying to figure out how when you have a diabetic seizure, do you end up getting ketamine? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1399.48s)]
*  Last July, Barb Johnson's son, Max, had a diabetic seizure and his girlfriend, Abby, called 911. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1405.96s)]
*  Johnson, who spoke on her son's behalf, says the police didn't think it was diabetes, but that Max had been using drugs. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1412.6s)]
*  The officers had Abby cornered continually asking her about drugs, telling her that if you, you know, we don't want to rip your apartment apart, where are they? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1419.6799999999998s)]
*  Were drugs involved in any way? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1429.44s)]
*  This was a seizure related to hypoglycemia. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1431.72s)]
*  As Max emerged from the seizure, confused, agitated and combative, records show paramedics gave him ketamine, a bad choice after seizures, according to his mother, a nurse. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1435.12s)]
*  It's unacceptable to me. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1446.24s)]
*  You know, EMS doesn't always have a reliable, accurate witness to tell them what's going on. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1449.4399999999998s)]
*  These folks did. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1454.8799999999999s)]
*  His girlfriend, Abby, watched as after two doses, Max lost consciousness and was rushed to Hennepin Health Care, the same facility where Dr. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1456.0s)]
*  Jeffrey Ho launched ketamine studies. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1464.08s)]
*  Max had to be put on a ventilator for two days, but ultimately recovered. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1466.68s)]
*  Hennepin Health Care declined our request for an interview. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1471.16s)]
*  I'm literally telling you, if this happens to my family, it can happen to anybody. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1474.52s)]
*  Ketamine is supposed to be a medical choice by paramedics in Minnesota, not a law enforcement tool wielded by the police. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1481.2s)]
*  If they're fighting with police and they don't want to be placed under arrest, that's not a medical emergency. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1489.48s)]
*  Paramedic Joe Baker says he believes it is a tempting way to end rocky police encounters. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1494.52s)]
*  Baker, who brought a whistleblower's lawsuit after resigning from his job in Woodbury, Minnesota, was called last year to the home of a man suffering a mental health crisis. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1499.8400000000001s)]
*  He says the police requested that he arrive needle ready, prepared to administer ketamine. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1510.0s)]
*  Each police officer asked me if I had my ketamine drawn up, but I let the police officers know I have it with me. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1515.2s)]
*  I'm not going to draw it up. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1521.08s)]
*  I want to make sure that the patient's being evaluated. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1522.3600000000001s)]
*  And they were not happy with that. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1524.88s)]
*  Joe Baker said he settled the patient without medication. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1526.68s)]
*  We moved him inside the ambulance. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1529.88s)]
*  And the interesting part of that was the next thing that that individual said was, well, what's the score of the Vikings? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1531.72s)]
*  And at that point, I realized how much regret I would have if I decided to follow those directives and administer ketamine. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1539.2s)]
*  So you deliver the patient to the hospital. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1547.04s)]
*  After you do that, what happens? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1549.76s)]
*  I found out from my partner that the police officer was asking why I wasn't willing to play ball and cooperate with them when they're asking me to drop ketamine. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1551.4s)]
*  And so I found the police officer waiting for me at the fire station after we finished the call. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1562.6s)]
*  Was he trying to make you feel like you had made them less safe by not coming in and administering it? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1569.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1574.04s)]
*  In a statement, the city of Woodbury said Baker's claims are without merit and its officers followed policy. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1575.84s)]
*  Policing by needle for a highly debated condition of excited delirium is hard to track because emergency medical services are decentralized. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1582.56s)]
*  But Baker says the practice overrides the paramedic's duty to care for patients, a point that he said he made to his superiors. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1591.4s)]
*  Did they say you did the right thing? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1599.64s)]
*  No, they told me that I was being insubordinate to that police officer for refusing to administer ketamine. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1601.3600000000001s)]
*  How can you be insubordinate in doing something you're. That they're not supposed to ask you to do. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1608.5600000000002s)]
*  That's a very good question. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1613.44s)]
*  Every time there's a massacre at a school like the recent one in Oregon, it reignites the debate for more gun control, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1622.4s)]
*  not only because of the mass shootings, but because of the hundreds of incidents of gun violence every day on our streets and in our homes. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1630.4s)]
*  One idea that keeps coming up is smart guns. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1639.4s)]
*  These are firearms that only work when they're fired by their owner. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1642.4s)]
*  It seems that gee whiz technology is seeping into every corner of our lives. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1647.4s)]
*  Why not guns in the 2012 movie Skyfall? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1652.4s)]
*  Q gives James Bond a smart gun that only he can activate encoded to your palm prints. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1658.4s)]
*  Only you can fire it later when the bad guy gets a hold of it. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1665.4s)]
*  Good luck with that. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1670.4s)]
*  Firearms that recognize only their owner aren't just the stuff of movies. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1671.4s)]
*  Army veteran Tom Lynch is developing a touch pad scanner that recognizes fingerprints like an iPhone. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1680.4s)]
*  Add it to an existing gun and it's a smart gun. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1688.4s)]
*  So it's recognizing you. It's recognizing me. OK. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1692.4s)]
*  Now, now it's unlocked. It's still on fire. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1695.4s)]
*  Let me try it. Let's see if I can pull the trigger. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1701.4s)]
*  I can't even pull the trigger. That's the point. It's locked. It's locked. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1705.4s)]
*  Other inventors are working on guns that recognize the squeeze of your grip or unlock wirelessly if the shooter wears a watch or a ring. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1709.4s)]
*  These guns would not have prevented many of the mass shootings because the gunmen owned the firearms. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1719.4s)]
*  But smart gun advocates say they could counter this all too common grim reality. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1725.4s)]
*  A 14 year old boy accidentally shot and killed his nine year old brother. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1731.4s)]
*  Children shot and killed by other children. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1736.4s)]
*  That tragic shooting, two friends playing with a gun when it goes off. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1738.4s)]
*  Smart guns could curtail the number of suicides and cut down on the resale of stolen guns estimated to be two hundred thirty thousand every year. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1743.4s)]
*  What good is a gun? No one but the owner can fire. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1753.4s)]
*  Shots fired in the city of an officer down. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1756.4s)]
*  And they would help on duty cops. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1758.4s)]
*  There was a struggle and Clark grabbed Officer Smith's gun and shot him two times. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1761.4s)]
*  And yet with at least a half dozen smart guns in advanced development and some ready for manufacturing, no major U.S. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1766.4s)]
*  gun company is making them and no gun dealer is willing to sell them. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1774.4s)]
*  Why? Well, consider what happened to one Maryland gun dealer who tried. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1780.4s)]
*  I like the way Sterling Sterling Arsenal actually painted this thing. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1784.4s)]
*  Last year, Andy Raymond, co-owner of Engage Armament, announced that he'd sell the Armatix IP1, a smart pistol made in Germany. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1788.4s)]
*  Who did you think would be interested in that kind of a gun? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1797.4s)]
*  Typically what I like to call fence sitters. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1801.4s)]
*  So people who people who aren't normally into guns and don't normally want one, you know, I'm too afraid or whatever. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1803.4s)]
*  Did you anticipate the reaction that you got? No. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1810.4s)]
*  Within minutes of his announcement, angry emails and phone calls started coming. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1814.4s)]
*  We got about 2000 phone calls and maybe about the same emails. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1819.4s)]
*  All against. Yeah, that was just in one day. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1823.4s)]
*  I mean, it was insane. I mean, one person threatened to burn down the shop. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1825.4s)]
*  Another person threatened that I would be raped. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1828.4s)]
*  That was that was classic. Yeah. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1831.4s)]
*  Did you get any death threats? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1833.4s)]
*  Yeah, the crazies did come out of the woodwork. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1835.4s)]
*  That's him that night shaved head and whiskey bottle at his side. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1837.4s)]
*  He stayed in his store to guard it and posted this video on Facebook. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1842.4s)]
*  So anyway, obviously I received numerous death threats today. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1847.4s)]
*  I really appreciate that. That's that's classy. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1851.4s)]
*  That's a great thing for gun rights when you threaten to shoot somebody. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1854.4s)]
*  He thinks the campaign against him was viral, not organized by the gun lobby. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1857.4s)]
*  Though in his rant, he wondered why gun lovers and the National Rifle Association would oppose the sale of any gun. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1863.4s)]
*  How can the NRA or people want to prohibit a gun when we're supposed to be pro gun? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1870.4s)]
*  We're supposed to say that any gun is good in the right person's hands. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1876.4s)]
*  How can they say that a gun should be prohibited? How hypocritical is that? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1881.4s)]
*  If you believe in the Second Amendment, the Second Amendment is absolute. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1884.4s)]
*  The right of people keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1887.4s)]
*  Then you should be able to buy whatever you want. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1890.4s)]
*  What Andy didn't realize is that there's a long beleaguered history to these devices. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1893.4s)]
*  Fifteen years ago, gunmaker Smith and Wesson promised the Clinton White House to develop smart guns as part of a deal to fend off liability litigation. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1899.4s)]
*  Under the agreement, Smith and Wesson will develop smart guns that can be fired only by the adults who own them. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1909.4s)]
*  The gun lobby organized a boycott against Smith and Wesson, seeing smart guns and other concessions in the deal as part of the gun control agenda. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1916.4s)]
*  Factories closed, employees were laid off, and after that, no big U.S. gunmaker ever went near a smart gun. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1926.4s)]
*  There's a lot of skepticism and a lot of resistance to them. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1934.4s)]
*  Steve Sinetti, president of the Gun Lobby and Trade Group, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, represents over 12,000 gunmakers, dealers and businesses. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1937.4s)]
*  Does your organization see the smart gun as gun control? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1948.4s)]
*  People that own guns are not the ones saying, I'm the one that want this, please develop it. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1952.4s)]
*  It's coming from the gun control side. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1957.4s)]
*  It's coming from people who, frankly, really want to put as many obstacles to a gun going off as they can. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1959.4s)]
*  Why are dealers who want to sell it, why are they being intimidated not to, why not let the market decide? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1966.4s)]
*  People don't want it, don't buy it. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1973.4s)]
*  Well, I agree. We think the market should be able to decide that. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1976.4s)]
*  Well, we have never fought the idea that dealers can put them on the shelves. It's totally up to the marketplace. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1979.4s)]
*  So where is that fight coming from? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1984.4s)]
*  That's the point. People don't understand the passion that firearms owners have for the firearms that they own. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1986.4s)]
*  The passion has been fueled by the NRA, which says on its legislative website, smart guns could open the door to a ban on all other guns. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=1992.4s)]
*  Why do they say that? Well, it's actually happened. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2002.4s)]
*  In 2002, New Jersey's governor signed a law that became known as the mandate. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2006.4s)]
*  There is a statute in the state of New Jersey that would say that once a gun like this is offered for sale anywhere, that's the only kind of gun that could be sold. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2011.4s)]
*  If these guns are sold in Wyoming or California, this triggers this law that everybody in New Jersey has to have that. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2020.4s)]
*  Loretta Weinberg, the New Jersey state senator who authored the law, didn't foresee its consequences. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2029.4s)]
*  We passed that bill to help spur this technology. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2036.4s)]
*  It appears it totally backfired because it spurred this passionate objection to the gun. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2040.4s)]
*  Because of the intervention of the NRA and the Second Amendment folks. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2046.4s)]
*  That they say the reason they intervene is because of the mandate. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2050.4s)]
*  Right. It isn't the law that stopped the development. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2053.4s)]
*  It is the people who threatened folks who actually wanted to sell such a gun. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2057.4s)]
*  Andy Raymond came to realize that even if he had sold the Armitix gun in Maryland, it might have triggered the mandate, banning the sale of regular handguns in New Jersey. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2063.4s)]
*  The people of New Jersey, my apologies. You've got nothing to worry about from me. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2075.4s)]
*  I did apologize. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to this day. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2080.4s)]
*  Did you actually sell any of the Armitix guns? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2086.4s)]
*  No. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2089.4s)]
*  After his case came to her attention, the New Jersey senator offered to rescind the mandate if the gun lobby publicly removed its opposition to smart guns. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2090.4s)]
*  She's yet to hear back. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2100.4s)]
*  They seem to oppose almost everything. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2102.4s)]
*  Any time we suggest anything, we've gotten very little cooperation back. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2105.4s)]
*  If the law were completely repealed, do you think that the gun lobby would then let this go forward? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2111.4s)]
*  No. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2117.4s)]
*  Why are you trying to take my firearm, which I store safely and properly and I've never had problems with it, and add something to it that's going to make it more prone to failure? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2118.4s)]
*  What about this argument that we have seat belts, we have airbags, they're mandatory. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2126.4s)]
*  Why not make a safe gun mandatory? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2133.4s)]
*  Firearms are safe. The firearms manufacturers include appropriate locking devices for their guns along with them when they're shipped. They may be low tech, but they work. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2136.4s)]
*  He says adding high tech to guns may make them less safe. For example, the batteries that operate the smart guns. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2145.4s)]
*  We've all had battery operated devices where the battery dies. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2153.4s)]
*  So the people who are working on this tell us that the batteries will have a 10 year life. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2156.4s)]
*  What about the 11th year? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2162.4s)]
*  Well, you change the battery. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2164.4s)]
*  If you remember. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2166.4s)]
*  No, you're going to get a warning. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2168.4s)]
*  If the gun is stored inside a cabinet or a box or a safe or something like that, you might not see the warning. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2170.4s)]
*  Other concerns. Will fingerprints work in snow and rain? Will they work if you're sweating because an intruder entered your home? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2175.4s)]
*  Could guns using wireless technology be hacked or jammed and disabled remotely by the government? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2184.4s)]
*  We have to be careful not to fall into the technology trap. It doesn't solve every problem. It's great. We're not we're not Luddites. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2191.4s)]
*  We're not here saying that technology is a bad thing. Technology obviously improves our life in many ways. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2197.4s)]
*  But I think you have to look at firearms in a slightly different way. Their mechanisms are the way they are over centuries of development. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2202.4s)]
*  They're at the state now that the consumers want them. And in the United States, there's lots of tradition involved with firearms. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2209.4s)]
*  People like guns of the old west. They like them the way Davy Crockett used them. They like them the way they were used years ago. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2216.4s)]
*  That was the case a decade and a half ago as Jonathan Mossberg found out he had left his family's gun making business Mossberg and Sons and invented a smart gun that works in conjunction with a ring. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2222.4s)]
*  Do I get my get my own? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2236.4s)]
*  You get your own ring. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2238.4s)]
*  The ring has a tiny computer chip inside a black stone which transmits a signal when it's close to the trigger. It unlocks the gun. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2239.4s)]
*  Alternatively, if I were to grab it, you know, nothing happens. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2248.4s)]
*  Mossberg's gun was ready to sell 13 years ago, but people weren't really there were some market, but not enough. So we decided not to sell it. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2253.4s)]
*  And is something changed? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2263.4s)]
*  Yes, we all started living with with these evil things. And so we became comfortable trusting it. They guide us to our destinations. They make sure we're OK for meetings and they're extremely reliable. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2265.4s)]
*  He thinks that today's young parents comfortable with technology are a ripe market and Silicon Valley agrees. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2277.4s)]
*  This is going to happen outside the gun industry. Why they aren't doing research and investing in this baffles me. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2286.4s)]
*  Ron Conway, one of the early investors in Facebook and Google, is now looking for, he says, the Mark Zuckerberg of guns. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2295.4s)]
*  He has funded at least 15 smart gun inventors, including those involved in the two guns we tested. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2303.4s)]
*  Are you thinking that if the gun manufacturers don't come along, that they're going to be like Kodak? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2310.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2318.4s)]
*  This is what you're saying. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2319.4s)]
*  Yes, Kodak and Polaroid all wrapped in one. You cannot stop innovation. And this is an area where innovation is taking over. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2320.4s)]
*  Are you not worried about the politics of this whole issue? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2330.4s)]
*  I think for technology and innovation, we have to ignore politics. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2333.4s)]
*  Can you? Of course you can. But when it comes to guns, it's all about politics. Just ask Andy Raymond. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2339.4s)]
*  I got caught up in the middle of something that was way beyond me, way beyond my capabilities and got caught between two sides that I mean, it was just I will never, ever, ever touch anything else like that ever, ever again. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2347.4s)]
*  As of today, you cannot find a smart gun to buy in the United States. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2363.4s)]
*  Senator Loretta Weinberg told us that she plans to ask the New Jersey state legislature to repeal the mandate, but replace it with a demand that dealers display at least one smart gun in their stores. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2368.4s)]
*  Question is, will dealers be too gun shy? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2383.4s)]
*  If this gun does take off, would you sell it? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2387.4s)]
*  Absolutely not. Ever. I would rather be shot by a smart gun than sell one. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2392.4s)]
*  As the coronavirus pandemic sweeps through the country, panic and fear have caused a run on hand sanitizer, toilet paper and guns. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2423.4s)]
*  Retailers tell us they have never seen such a surge in firearm sales. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2434.4s)]
*  One kind of weapon that has been selling out is a build-it-yourself firearm known as a ghost gun because it skirts most federal gun laws. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2439.4s)]
*  There is no background check and no serial number making ghost guns invisible to police and almost impossible to trace when used in a crime. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2449.4s)]
*  We were surprised that it is all perfectly legal. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2458.4s)]
*  After a year and a half of reporting, we discovered that ghost guns, once mainly popular with gun enthusiasts, have also become a weapon of choice for criminals, manufactured by gangs and used in mass shootings. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2462.4s)]
*  So this is ATF's firearms reference library. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2479.4s)]
*  We sought out America's top gun cops, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the ATF, to find out exactly what a ghost gun is. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2482.4s)]
*  Thomas Chidham, ATF's Assistant Director of Field Operations, gave us rare access to its West Virginia weapons repository and told us the latest additions here are ghost guns. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2493.4s)]
*  What's the difference between these two guns? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2506.4s)]
*  Well, this is a firearm that was manufactured by a licensed manufacturer. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2508.4s)]
*  The law requires them to mark them with certain markings, including a serial number. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2513.4s)]
*  This is not marked. No background check is completed when you purchase it. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2518.4s)]
*  It's made at home by somebody using commonly available hand tools. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2522.4s)]
*  So they both do the same thing? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2528.4s)]
*  They both shoot. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2530.4s)]
*  As Chidham says, usually if you bought a gun at a store, it would have a traceable serial number and you would need to pass a background check under federal law. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2531.4s)]
*  A ghost gun can circumvent all of that because it's put together from unfinished, untraceable parts. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2541.4s)]
*  It's virtually invisible to you in government. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2548.4s)]
*  It also makes it challenging to keep it out of the hands of people who are not allowed to possess firearms. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2551.4s)]
*  Up to that day, I never heard the term ghost gun. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2556.4s)]
*  I didn't even know what that was. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2561.4s)]
*  Brian Muehlberger found out one day last November there had been a mass shooting at his daughter's high school and 15-year-old Gracie was murdered. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2563.4s)]
*  They bring in one of the head doctors and just like you see on the movies, he sits across from you with that real quiet, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2573.4s)]
*  kind of solemn stare right at you. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2585.4s)]
*  And I just remember saying, you know, I'm like, please, no, don't tell me the bad news, please. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2589.4s)]
*  This was the aftermath at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2597.4s)]
*  A typical Thursday morning disrupted. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2602.4s)]
*  The quad littered with backpacks after students dropped everything and fled for their lives. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2605.4s)]
*  That's where Gracie was waiting for friends before class. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2610.4s)]
*  She was about as close as I am to you right now. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2614.4s)]
*  Shot her right through the backpack and right through her chest. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2617.4s)]
*  And thankfully, he didn't aim at the back of her head. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2620.4s)]
*  You know, at least we got to see her face one more time. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2624.4s)]
*  This senseless act of violence. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2627.4s)]
*  Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva arrived at the scene not long after the shots were fired. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2629.4s)]
*  This kid shows up at school. What happened? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2636.4s)]
*  He shows up at school. He has a backpack. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2639.4s)]
*  His mom had packed the lunch for him. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2642.4s)]
*  In the backpack was also a 45 auto. It was loaded. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2645.4s)]
*  Carrying that loaded ghost gun was Nathaniel Burhow, a high school junior. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2650.4s)]
*  In addition to Gracie, he shot and killed Dominic Blackwell and wounded three other students. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2655.4s)]
*  He saved the last round for himself. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2662.4s)]
*  He's 16 years old. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2665.4s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Just turned. That was his birthday. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2667.4s)]
*  How does a 16-year-old get his hands on a gun? He's underage. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2670.4s)]
*  Underage, but his father was a gun enthusiast and was in possession of a lot of weapons. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2675.4s)]
*  They were ultimately confiscated because he was detained for psychiatric evaluation. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2681.4s)]
*  So he, the father, was not supposed to have guns. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2686.4s)]
*  And all the weapons were removed legally at the time. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2689.4s)]
*  Sheriff Villanueva suspects that's when the father turned to ghost guns and his son got his hands on one. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2693.4s)]
*  Six months later, the Saugus investigation is still ongoing. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2700.4s)]
*  This is the actual weapon that was used in the Saugus shooting. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2705.4s)]
*  It is a ghost gun. It was assembled. We don't know by who, but we believe it was the father of the suspect, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2708.4s)]
*  and it came into possession then of the shooter himself. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2713.4s)]
*  Ghost gun parts can be used to fabricate a handgun or even an AR-15. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2717.4s)]
*  The parts are widely available across the country in stores and online. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2723.4s)]
*  In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, they have been flying off the shelves. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2728.4s)]
*  They're shipped right to your door, not much harder than ordering a pizza. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2733.4s)]
*  We bought a kit online for $575 that has everything you need to make a 9-millimeter handgun. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2738.4s)]
*  It came in parts like IKEA furniture, but for firearms, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2746.4s)]
*  and even includes the drill bits you need to put the gun together in the comfort of your own home. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2750.4s)]
*  Why is it so easy to buy? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2756.4s)]
*  Because federal gun law only regulates this part, called a frame or a lower receiver. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2759.4s)]
*  But until you drill out these holes and file down this bit here, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2766.4s)]
*  in the eyes of federal law, it's just a hunk of metal or in this case, plastic. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2771.4s)]
*  What you do is you get your lower here. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2777.4s)]
*  YouTube videos will show you step by step how to turn that piece of plastic or metal into a gun. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2780.4s)]
*  So if I can do this, anybody can do this. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2787.4s)]
*  So you have pretty much this open season. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2790.4s)]
*  Anyone who is a prohibited person that wants to arm themselves now has a very easy way to do it. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2793.4s)]
*  But if you're a felon or a judge mentally unfit, for example, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2798.4s)]
*  federal law says you're not supposed to have any kind of firearm. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2802.4s)]
*  Build a ghost gun? No one knows you have it. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2806.4s)]
*  These are all ghost guns? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2810.4s)]
*  Everything here is a ghost gun. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2812.4s)]
*  Ironically, California has some of the strictest state gun laws in the U.S. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2813.4s)]
*  And yet, it's the epicenter of this growing problem. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2818.4s)]
*  Where on your list of worries do these ghost guns fall? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2822.4s)]
*  Well, along with terrorism, active shooter, this is way up there on the list. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2826.4s)]
*  Via Nueva oversees the largest sheriff's office in the country. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2831.4s)]
*  And he says over the last year, the number of ghost guns turning up in L.A. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2835.4s)]
*  County investigations has jumped by 50 percent. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2840.4s)]
*  Domestic assault, assault with a deadly weapon, distribution of child pornography, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2844.4s)]
*  possession of child pornography armed with a ghost gun, domestic violence, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2850.4s)]
*  domestic violence, assault with a deadly weapon, drug deal. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2855.4s)]
*  It's an epidemic that has blindsided police across the country. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2860.4s)]
*  Without a serial number or paperwork, ghost guns are very difficult for law enforcement to trace or track. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2864.4s)]
*  Which is why Thomas Chidham and the ATF are struggling to get a handle on the problem. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2871.4s)]
*  How many of these guns are on the streets? You have no idea? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2879.4s)]
*  No, I have no idea. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2882.4s)]
*  And how many crimes are being committed by these guns? You have no idea? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2884.4s)]
*  Well, not with precision. They still represent a minority of the firearms that are being used in crimes. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2888.4s)]
*  But we do see that they're increasing significantly and rapidly. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2895.4s)]
*  So you have no idea how many guns are out there and you don't know who has them? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2901.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2907.4s)]
*  Here's what our reporting found. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2909.4s)]
*  Contacting local and national law enforcement over the course of a year and a half, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2911.4s)]
*  at least 38 states and Washington, D.C., have seen criminal cases involving ghost guns. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2916.4s)]
*  There were at least four mass shootings. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2923.4s)]
*  Drop that gun! [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2926.4s)]
*  Violent police shootouts. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2928.4s)]
*  High-profile busts of gangs making and selling ghost guns on the street. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2930.4s)]
*  And cases involving terrorism and white supremacists. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2935.4s)]
*  But Demetrius Karras says that's not his clientele at all. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2940.4s)]
*  You can get the whole gun out the door for about $550. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2944.4s)]
*  He is a former Marine and one of the first to get into the business of selling ghost gun parts in California 10 years ago. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2947.4s)]
*  Between 300 and 500,000 individual units have passed through my hands. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2955.4s)]
*  Over what period of time? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2960.4s)]
*  The last 10 years. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2961.4s)]
*  Sounds like a lot to me. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2963.4s)]
*  That's just from your store. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2964.4s)]
*  That's just from what I've been involved in. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2966.4s)]
*  There's a lot of companies that are now in this industry, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2969.4s)]
*  and there are multiple millions of these things that have been created throughout the country at this point. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2972.4s)]
*  So who is buying these kits? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2976.4s)]
*  It's guys in hard hats. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2978.4s)]
*  It's also the people who like to work with their hands and do this sort of thing anyway. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2980.4s)]
*  I'd say hogwash to that entire idea. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2983.4s)]
*  Hogwash. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2987.4s)]
*  Hogwash. Absolute hogwash. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2988.4s)]
*  The only people that are interested in that are not enthusiasts into, you know, tink around with machines. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2990.4s)]
*  Hobbyists. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2996.4s)]
*  No, they're not hobbyists. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2997.4s)]
*  These are people that should never have a firearm, and that's how they found a way to get one. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=2998.4s)]
*  Carras insists the store where he now works, which touts just how invisible their ghost gun parts are... [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3002.4s)]
*  That thing looks cool. I really like it. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3009.4s)]
*  ...has safeguards to prevent ghost gun parts from getting into the wrong hands. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3011.4s)]
*  And what are they? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3016.4s)]
*  I'm not going to get too much into it because it would undermine our ability to use them. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3017.4s)]
*  Do you ever worry that someone who's buying one of these kits might have a mental illness [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3023.4s)]
*  or, you know, be planning to use an AR-15 for something that's horrible, unimaginable? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3029.4s)]
*  Does a car salesman worry that someone might take a car that they've sold to them and drive it through a crowd of people? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3037.4s)]
*  So you see them as the same? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3042.4s)]
*  I do. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3045.4s)]
*  Carras' home state, California, is phasing in a law to regulate ghost gun parts like regular firearms. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3046.4s)]
*  Three other states and the District of Columbia have passed their own restrictions. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3053.4s)]
*  But Villanueva says that's not enough. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3058.4s)]
*  We need national laws, or federal, from Congress that covers a total ban on the creation or the selling of these ghost gun kits. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3061.4s)]
*  State by state is not going to do it? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3070.4s)]
*  It doesn't because then you can just defeat it by going to another state. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3072.4s)]
*  Hey, what's up, dude? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3075.4s)]
*  In today's political climate, new federal gun control measures seem unlikely. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3076.4s)]
*  Cool. You're all set, man. Thanks a lot, dude. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3081.4s)]
*  So that leaves it to the ATF to determine what is and is not a gun. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3083.4s)]
*  Currently, ATF says this is not a gun. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3088.4s)]
*  But the ATF has changed its thinking on similar issues recently. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3093.4s)]
*  After the 2017 massacre in Las Vegas, the ATF and the Department of Justice banned bump stocks, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3099.4s)]
*  an accessory that turns semi-automatic weapons into machine guns. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3106.4s)]
*  Former acting director of the ATF, Thomas Brandon, helped implement that change [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3111.4s)]
*  and was ready to recommend to his bosses at the Department of Justice that they reclassify certain ghost gun kits, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3117.4s)]
*  like the one we ordered, as firearms because of how easy they are to put together. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3124.4s)]
*  You were alarmed at what you were seeing? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3129.4s)]
*  Yeah. And so I said, well, right now we have a public safety concern. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3131.4s)]
*  You thought that the ATF should reclassify these kits as firearms? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3136.4s)]
*  Yes. As the head of the agency at the time, I said I'm going to do everything I can for public safety with my team. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3143.4s)]
*  If you want to buy a kit and make your own gun, it's just going to have a serial number on it. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3148.4s)]
*  Thomas Brandon retired last spring before any action was taken. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3152.4s)]
*  We asked the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives if there was any follow-up on Brandon's plans [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3157.4s)]
*  and were told, quote, ATF routinely reviews our practices, procedures and determinations. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3165.4s)]
*  However, it would be inappropriate to comment on internal discussions. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3172.4s)]
*  Thomas Chidum says the ATF is doing everything it can. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3177.4s)]
*  Is this just one of those political hot potatoes that nobody wants to touch? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3182.4s)]
*  Well, gun law is one of the most divisive topics in America, and ATF sometimes finds itself in the middle. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3186.4s)]
*  As for Saugus, it was the first high school mass shooting with a ghost gun. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3194.4s)]
*  Brian Muehlberger, a pistol owner himself, says if something isn't done about ghost guns, it won't be the last. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3200.4s)]
*  I'm not against owning guns, but I also believe strongly that this is a serious problem that's occurring that no one knew about. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3208.4s)]
*  So I just feel like something needs to be done. It's just, it's become too easy. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3219.4s)]
*  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afoi27lHlY&t=3230.4s)]
