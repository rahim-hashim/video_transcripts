# Master of the Mind; Sealand | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc)
*  We're going to go work right in there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=0.0s)]
*  Most American families know someone who's been afflicted with Alzheimer's disease or [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  the scourge of addiction. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=12.92s)]
*  Tonight, we will show you research that is being done on both and introduce you to the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=14.84s)]
*  pioneering neuroscientist who allowed us to follow his startling progress. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=20.46s)]
*  Okay ready we can sonicate now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=25.84s)]
*  There we go. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=28.04s)]
*  There's always risk, but you cannot advance and make discoveries without risk. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=29.2s)]
*  But we need to push forward and take the risk because people with addiction and Alzheimer's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=34.8s)]
*  is not going away. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=40.84s)]
*  It's here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=42.32s)]
*  So why wait 10, 20 years? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=43.32s)]
*  Do it now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=45.76s)]
*  Enter some countries you arrive in style. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=49.68s)]
*  Here you arrive in what's basically a backyard swing hoisted by a crank 60 feet above the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=52.2s)]
*  North Sea. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=57.44s)]
*  And if you're wondering about the safety regulations, yeah us too. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=58.44s)]
*  Then again, when you are a sovereign nation, you by definition set your own rules. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  That's a hell of a way to get into a country. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=68.8s)]
*  The only way to travel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=71.08s)]
*  Welcome to Sealand, a monarchy that declared its independence in 1967. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=72.92s)]
*  Just wait till you hear this story. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=78.82s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=83.3s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=84.84s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=87.48s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=88.84s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=90.04s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=91.4s)]
*  Those stories tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  Anyone who has had experience with Alzheimer's disease knows the agony of watching someone [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=103.64s)]
*  fade away as it steals memory and at the end a person's own identity. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  Tonight we'll show you an experimental way to try and beat back Alzheimer's. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=114.12s)]
*  It's been tested on just a handful of patients but caught our attention because of the doctor [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=118.72s)]
*  involved, Dr. Ali Rezai, who 60 Minutes first met 20 years ago. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  Dr. Rezai is a neuroscience pioneer who has developed treatments for Parkinson's disease [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=128.84s)]
*  and other brain disorders. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=134.84s)]
*  For over a year we followed this master of the mind as he attempted to delay the progression [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  of Alzheimer's disease and its worst symptoms using ultrasound. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=142.78s)]
*  As we first reported in January, we saw a cutting edge approach to brain surgery with [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=147.82s)]
*  no cutting. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=152.88s)]
*  If we can we should not be doing brain surgery. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  You're a brain surgeon. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=157.34s)]
*  I am but I should be out of a job because brain surgery, it's cutting the skin, opening [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=158.34s)]
*  the skull, it can be barbaric. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=163.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to go right in there. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=165.5s)]
*  It looked like a scene from a sci-fi movie. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=168.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  A halo-wrapped patient pushed into a tube as a team of doctors manipulate his brain [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=172.05999999999997s)]
*  from the other side of the glass. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=178.78s)]
*  Gain high, modulate power, three minutes, okay we're ready to go. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=180.26s)]
*  Dr. Ali Rezai allowed us to witness his revolutionary attempt to use ultrasound to slow down the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=184.17999999999998s)]
*  cognitive decline in three patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=190.33999999999997s)]
*  It's never been done before. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=195.22s)]
*  There's no miracle cure here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  It's advancing medicine with calculated risks and pushing the frontiers. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=199.14s)]
*  So we're targeting these areas. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=203.05999999999997s)]
*  Dr. Rezai and his team are focused on these red patches in the patient's brain scans. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=204.66s)]
*  The red indicates the densest beta amyloid protein. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=210.17999999999998s)]
*  That gummy protein is believed to play a major role in Alzheimer's by disrupting communication [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=214.45999999999998s)]
*  between brain cells. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  In people with Alzheimer's it accumulates much faster. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=222.38s)]
*  And over time these protein aggregates we call them plaques, like plaques in the arteries. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=226.32s)]
*  They keep on accumulating and impacting function. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=232.76s)]
*  There are new drugs that can help break up the beta amyloid plaque in the brain. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=236.88s)]
*  The first to be approved by the FDA was aducanumab in 2021. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=241.44s)]
*  The drug is given intravenously but Dr. Rezai told us it works slowly. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=246.9s)]
*  Typically you go into the clinic and you get an IV and you have the antibody infusion [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=252.92s)]
*  over one to two hours and you have to do it once a month or twice a month for 18 months [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=258.47999999999996s)]
*  and longer. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=264.12s)]
*  And during those 12 to 18 months the brain is continuing to progress. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=265.12s)]
*  Alzheimer's is not going away. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  It takes so long because the drugs have a hard time getting through something called [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=271.64s)]
*  the blood-brain barrier. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  This tight filter of cells lined the blood vessels to keep toxins from leaking into the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=277.74s)]
*  brain but it also prevents almost all of the medication from getting into. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=282.54s)]
*  We think that that's what's causing the baby disruption by opening this ear. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=288.14s)]
*  Dr. Rezai thought he could solve that problem with ultrasound. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=291.38s)]
*  The same technology that's been used for 70 years to give doctors a view of organs and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=295.22s)]
*  fetal development. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=300.18s)]
*  He chose ultrasound because it easily penetrates the skull and can be focused like sunlight [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=303.82s)]
*  through a magnifying glass to help open the blood-brain barrier and allow the drugs to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=310.02s)]
*  rush in. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=315.23999999999995s)]
*  This way we're getting the payload, the therapeutic payload exactly to the area that needs to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=316.23999999999995s)]
*  go with a high penetration. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=320.79999999999995s)]
*  But we've got to be careful because we want to be safe about this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=323.17999999999995s)]
*  You don't want to deliver too much. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=325.5s)]
*  You don't want to open the blood-brain barrier too much. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=326.5s)]
*  Because if you open it too much what could happen? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  You can get bleeding in the brain, you can get swelling in the brain, you can get many [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=330.7s)]
*  other problems so you have to get it just right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=334.65999999999997s)]
*  We will show you exactly how that worked and the early results in a minute. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=337.74s)]
*  But to understand why one of the country's most accomplished brain surgeons is betting [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=342.34s)]
*  on ultrasound, we have to go back to 2002 when Dr. Rezai first caught our attention [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=346.86s)]
*  in a story Morley Safer reported on treating Parkinson's disease. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=354.62s)]
*  Look up, show me your teeth, stick a tongue out. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=359.74s)]
*  Very good. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=362.70000000000005s)]
*  Dr. Rezai was among the first to implant a pacemaker-type device in the brain which stopped [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=363.70000000000005s)]
*  uncontrollable movements suffered by Parkinson's patients. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=369.66s)]
*  It's like traveling through a labyrinth as in the Greek myth. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=373.34000000000003s)]
*  Around every quarter you have that blood-thirsty monster that can jump on you so you want to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=377.54s)]
*  be careful to avoid these areas. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=381.38s)]
*  That kind of implant surgery is now routine for advanced Parkinson's. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=383.98s)]
*  Dr. Rezai went on to write hundreds of scientific papers, secure dozens of patents and present [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=388.38s)]
*  his Parkinson's research to Congress and the White House. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=393.98s)]
*  He could have gone to any big city research center but, true to form, he chose to try [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=397.38s)]
*  something different and moved to Morgantown, West Virginia where he is the executive director [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=402.26s)]
*  of the Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  It was a fantastic move because we were able to achieve so many things that would have [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=411.21999999999997s)]
*  been difficult at other institutions. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=414.54s)]
*  Sometimes in the bigger institutions you may not be hungry as much for it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=417.3s)]
*  You may have a thousand different agendas and priorities. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=420.1s)]
*  Here we think we have a very nimble and agile team that can quickly get outcomes. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=424.46000000000004s)]
*  Like in 2019, this is video Dr. Rezai's team took when they were among the first to use [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=429.14s)]
*  ultrasound to treat tremors. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=434.78000000000003s)]
*  For 15 years, Dan Wall had been suffering from essential tremor, a neurological disorder. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=437.26s)]
*  You okay? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=442.74s)]
*  You got a hat on now. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=443.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=444.74s)]
*  All right, very good. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=445.74s)]
*  Rezai's team focused ultrasound into a part of the brain called the thalamus to destroy [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=447.18s)]
*  a pinpoint-sized patch of tissue doctors believed was responsible for the tremors. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=451.94s)]
*  These are the 980 elements converging right there. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=457.78000000000003s)]
*  Wall was awake during the procedure. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=461.38s)]
*  After two hours, the 71-year-old's tremor was gone. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=465.62s)]
*  I'm feeling afraid I'm on drop. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=469.42s)]
*  You got it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=471.3s)]
*  I've got it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=472.3s)]
*  Really good. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=473.3s)]
*  Do you want to show off? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=474.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=475.3s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=476.86s)]
*  Praise the Lord. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=477.86s)]
*  That success helped convince Dr. Rezai that focused ultrasound could be adapted to patients [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=481.62s)]
*  with other brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=487.34000000000003s)]
*  My first symptoms that I noticed were that I was having trouble typing at work. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=491.74s)]
*  Did you think you had Alzheimer's? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=498.14s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=499.66s)]
*  Dan Miller is just 61 years old. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=501.3s)]
*  His wife Kathy began noticing changes four years ago. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=504.24s)]
*  He kind of hit it pretty well. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  And then I noticed he was having trouble, his clothes would be backwards and those kinds [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=510.0s)]
*  of things. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  Just little things. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  Just little things, yes. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  A scan of his brain revealed what Dan had been hiding. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  Mr. Miller had very large amounts of beta amyloid. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  The red spots indicated a buildup of those beta amyloid proteins, the so-called brain [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=527.24s)]
*  plaque, a marker of Alzheimer's. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=532.76s)]
*  Dr. Rezai explained to Miller he couldn't cure him of the disease, but he hoped to slow [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  its progression. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=540.4s)]
*  Why take part in the trial if it's not a cure? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=542.84s)]
*  I have to explain to you that I was at the point, you know, like in Dante's Inferno, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=546.24s)]
*  where it says, abandon all hope, you who enter here. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=552.04s)]
*  For me, it was just, you know, let's do this, you know. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=555.5s)]
*  What do I have to lose? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=558.68s)]
*  And you are infused in sari. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=560.16s)]
*  Here's how it worked. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=561.96s)]
*  Hours before the procedure, Miller was given an IV treatment of adacanumab, one of those [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=563.52s)]
*  new drugs to reduce beta amyloid plaque. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=568.52s)]
*  Miller was then fitted with this million-dollar helmet, similar to the one the team used to [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=573.52s)]
*  treat tremor patients. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=578.36s)]
*  It directs nearly a thousand beams of ultrasound energy at a target the size of a pencil point. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=580.4000000000001s)]
*  Basically, the patient lies on the MRI table and the head goes inside the helmet. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=587.24s)]
*  And the patient is immobilized with a halo or with a mouthpiece because we don't want [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=593.4000000000001s)]
*  movements to cause errors in our targeting in the brain. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  Is that comfortable? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=601.08s)]
*  It pops out? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=602.08s)]
*  Once inside, the MRI machine gave Dr. Rezai a 3D view of the plaque he would target in [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  Dan Miller's brain. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=609.4000000000001s)]
*  The next step was an IV solution that contained microscopic bubbles. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=611.22s)]
*  When hit with ultrasound energy, the bubbles pry open that blood-brain barrier. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=615.88s)]
*  Okay, ready, we can sonicate now. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=620.76s)]
*  There we go. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=623.16s)]
*  The bubbles start vibrating. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=626.08s)]
*  They're moving. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=628.04s)]
*  They're moving. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=629.04s)]
*  They start expanding. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=630.04s)]
*  So you can open the barrier temporarily. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=631.04s)]
*  Now it's open for 24 to 48 hours and then it reseals. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=635.64s)]
*  So this gives you a tremendous opportunity for 24 to 48 hours with the barrier being [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=639.92s)]
*  open so now therapeutists can get inside the brain. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=645.04s)]
*  You can't hear ultrasound. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=650.36s)]
*  That noise is a signal to tell Rezai's team the ultrasound is doing its work. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=652.12s)]
*  Very nice opening of the blood-brain barrier. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=657.5999999999999s)]
*  Each dot represents an area where all the waves, all the ultrasound waves converge and [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=661.36s)]
*  open the blood-brain barrier. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=666.68s)]
*  So this is just one blast, if you will. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=668.1999999999999s)]
*  One blast getting there. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=670.28s)]
*  And you're hitting one point. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=671.68s)]
*  One point and then it moves to the next one. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=673.26s)]
*  Even though patients were awake, they told us they didn't feel a thing. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=677.22s)]
*  It all took a couple of hours and they went home when it was over. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=681.14s)]
*  The three patients were given the treatments of ultrasound with infusion once month over [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=685.14s)]
*  six months. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=689.7s)]
*  That's another target right there. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=690.7s)]
*  The result? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=692.02s)]
*  Beta amyloid plaque targeted with ultrasound were reduced 50% more than areas treated by [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=693.02s)]
*  infusion alone. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=699.9s)]
*  Dr. Rezai shared the three patients' brain scans with us. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=702.82s)]
*  And the red indicates more density of beta amyloid plaques in the brain. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=706.86s)]
*  So you can see as you treat it with ultrasound. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=711.98s)]
*  Look closely at the areas outlined in white that were targeted with ultrasound and the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=714.1s)]
*  drug. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=718.5s)]
*  You get reduction. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=719.5s)]
*  Whoa, that's after. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=720.5s)]
*  That's after. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=721.5s)]
*  You can see the plaques are very significantly reduced by opening the blood-brain barrier [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=722.5s)]
*  just in one area. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=727.1s)]
*  Ready? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=728.34s)]
*  How do you lay back? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=729.34s)]
*  Dan Miller and the third patient in the trial had larger areas of their brain targeted with [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=730.34s)]
*  ultrasound. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=735.22s)]
*  And this is his baseline and then you can see here after 26 weeks, there's a very dramatic [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=736.34s)]
*  reduction in the beta amyloid in the areas as outlined by this white mark. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=742.74s)]
*  And now we're going to look at patient number three. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=749.46s)]
*  And this patient underwent antibody infusion therapy plus ultrasound. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=752.0600000000001s)]
*  You can see this area, which is really amazing. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=756.7s)]
*  The ultrasound opened the blood-brain barrier and the antibody went in faster and cleaned [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=759.98s)]
*  out the plaques. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=764.6s)]
*  What was your reaction when you saw this scan? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=765.86s)]
*  I mean, my jaw dropped. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=768.02s)]
*  I'm like, whoa. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=769.38s)]
*  I was actually even in the clinic seeing patients and the PET scan technician called and said, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=770.46s)]
*  oh yeah, there's a big change. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=775.78s)]
*  I'm like, how do you know? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=777.1800000000001s)]
*  We have to analyze it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=778.1800000000001s)]
*  He's like, no, you can see it on the screen. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=779.1800000000001s)]
*  What did you think when Dr. Razai shared the scans with you? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=781.26s)]
*  It was surreal. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=788.22s)]
*  You can really see it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=789.86s)]
*  You don't have to be a doctor to understand what's going on there. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=791.46s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=793.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=794.66s)]
*  Even the res decrease. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=795.66s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=796.66s)]
*  Kathy Miller says she can see it in her husband too, who slips up once in a while, but hasn't [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=797.66s)]
*  slipped further away. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=803.42s)]
*  He has trouble finding things. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=805.14s)]
*  I'll send him into the kitchen to get something and he's like, it's not there. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=807.1800000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, yes, it is. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=810.46s)]
*  I can see it, but he can't see it. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=812.34s)]
*  But if that's the worst, that's nothing. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=815.26s)]
*  He'll take it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=818.82s)]
*  Do you feel hopeful about the future? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=820.7800000000001s)]
*  I do, yes. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=823.46s)]
*  I learned that what I needed to do is accept that the old Dan is gone and then start working [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=825.1400000000001s)]
*  on the new me, which has a future. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=834.7800000000001s)]
*  Dr. Razai's team told us there was no change in the ability of the three patients to do [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=838.58s)]
*  their daily activities after the ultrasound treatments ended in July 2023. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=844.16s)]
*  Now the doctor has shown focused ultrasound can clear beta amyloid plaques faster. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=850.0799999999999s)]
*  He has FDA approval to use ultrasound to try and restore brain cell function lost to Alzheimer's. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=855.52s)]
*  What's the result of breaking up all those plaques to the damage that's already been [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=862.3199999999999s)]
*  done to the brain? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=866.1999999999999s)]
*  We don't know if it's going to reverse the damage to the brain because Alzheimer's, the [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=867.6s)]
*  underlying cause, is still occurring. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=872.68s)]
*  So we have another study that we're looking at with ultrasound. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=874.9599999999999s)]
*  First clear the plaques, then deliver ultrasound in a different dose to see now if we can reverse [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=878.3599999999999s)]
*  it or boost the brain work for people with Alzheimer's. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=885.4399999999999s)]
*  Since we first reported this story in January, Dr. Ali Razai says two of the three patients [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=890.9599999999999s)]
*  who had the limited treatments for Alzheimer's have experienced some decline. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=896.8s)]
*  When we come back, we will show you Dr. Razai's attempt to use ultrasound to reset the brain [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=901.84s)]
*  and help people suffering from drug addiction. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=907.2800000000001s)]
*  The human brain contains 100 billion neurons. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=918.5600000000001s)]

*  Dr. Ali Razai has spent 25 years exploring this frontier of medicine. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=925.32s)]

*  Dr. Razai allowed us to see his latest research over the last year at the Rockefeller Neuroscience [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=936.2s)]
*  Institute in Morgantown, West Virginia. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=942.5600000000001s)]
*  It includes revolutionary treatments for a brain disease suffered by 24 million Americans, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=945.44s)]
*  addiction. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=951.08s)]
*  As we first reported in January, the results have been life-changing for the people we [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=952.24s)]
*  met once trapped by drugs. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=957.28s)]
*  Looking back, I didn't have a chance. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=961.4s)]
*  What do you mean you didn't have a chance? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=963.4s)]
*  I couldn't do anything without having that drug in my system. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=964.92s)]
*  Jared Buchalter is the son of a coal miner. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=972.36s)]
*  At 6 foot 3, he was a high school football standout who dreamed of playing wide receiver [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=975.24s)]
*  at Penn State. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=980.4399999999999s)]
*  But after a shoulder injury, he got hooked on painkillers. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=982.24s)]
*  The very first time that I took that first pill, I knew that I wanted that feeling for [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=986.48s)]
*  the rest of my life. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=992.52s)]
*  What does it feel like? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=993.52s)]
*  It's just pure euphoria. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=995.24s)]
*  He took us to where he said he often went to buy drugs, including heroin. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=997.36s)]
*  Everybody in Morgantown knows to come here. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1002.4s)]
*  Probably 17, 18 years old, you know, just a kid. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1005.24s)]
*  Buchalter still looks like an athlete. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1009.52s)]
*  It's hard to imagine he was an addict for more than 15 years. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1011.9200000000001s)]
*  He told us he does not remember how many times he overdosed and that he couldn't stay clean [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1016.32s)]
*  for more than four days at a time. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1021.2s)]
*  I didn't know where I was going to sleep some nights. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1023.6s)]
*  My family didn't want me around anymore. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1026.24s)]
*  I did so many things to hurt them that it was just too much for them to deal with. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1029.64s)]
*  Five years ago, a psychologist who'd worked with Buchalter introduced him to Dr. Oli Rezai, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1035.3200000000002s)]
*  who was gearing up to perform a new kind of brain surgery to treat severe addiction. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1041.32s)]
*  Our protocol was people that have failed everything. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1047.28s)]
*  Once you've tried everything. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1050.6399999999999s)]
*  Everything. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1051.6399999999999s)]
*  Residential programs, multiple failures, detox multiple times, outpatient, inpatient, multiple [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1052.6399999999999s)]
*  overdoses. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1059.08s)]
*  I think he classified it as end-stage drug user. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1060.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, end-stage makes you think that this is the end of your life. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1064.04s)]
*  Correct. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1068.24s)]
*  Hearing that at the age of 34, it was crazy. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1069.4s)]
*  Bring the EBS electrode in. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1073.68s)]
*  Dr. Rezai thought he might be able to adapt technology he helped develop years earlier [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1076.04s)]
*  to treat Parkinson's disease to treat people with severe addiction. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1081.48s)]
*  We've been able to map out with neuroscience imaging there's a specific part of the brain [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1086.68s)]
*  that is electrically and chemically malfunctioning that is associated with addiction. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1092.16s)]
*  So it's not just willpower. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1097.32s)]
*  What's happening in the brain? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1099.84s)]
*  It's a brain disease. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1101.28s)]
*  It's an electrical and chemical abnormality in the brain that occurs over time with recurrent [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1102.3999999999999s)]
*  use of drugs. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1108.1599999999999s)]
*  And this can be any substance. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1110.0s)]
*  It's alcohol, can be opioids, amphetamines, cocaine. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1111.6s)]
*  And they all are involving the same part of the brain. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1115.72s)]
*  And so your idea was what with the implant? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1119.06s)]
*  Parkinson's, we implant that in the movement part of the brain that is electrically malfunctioning, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1122.24s)]
*  causing shaking. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1127.56s)]
*  In this case, we're going into behavioral regulation, anxiety and craving parts of the brain. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1128.9199999999998s)]
*  Dr. Rezai has seen the impact of addiction in his community. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1135.44s)]
*  The problem is so severe in Morgantown, a vending machine dispenses the overdose antidote, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1139.8799999999999s)]
*  Narcan, for free. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1145.36s)]
*  You got your baseline. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1146.72s)]
*  The National Institute on Drug Abuse agreed to support Dr. Rezai's attempt to fight addiction [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1148.2s)]
*  with a brain implant. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1153.6399999999999s)]
*  In 2019, the FDA gave him a green light to attempt the groundbreaking surgery. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1155.28s)]
*  That is Jared Buchhalter. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1163.04s)]
*  He agreed to be the first addiction patient in the U.S. to get the implant. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1164.8s)]
*  Dr. Rezai's team interviewed him the day before the surgery. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1169.24s)]
*  The best outcome possible would be just to cut the cravings out and make me feel a little [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1173.24s)]
*  bit better. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1181.92s)]
*  If those couple things happen, that's all I could possibly ask for. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1182.92s)]
*  At that time, I was so desperate for a better life that I was willing to do just about anything [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1190.8000000000002s)]
*  and I signed up to do it. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1196.8000000000002s)]
*  I think some people might look at this and think an electronic implant in the brain sounds [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1199.3200000000002s)]
*  a little creepy. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1204.76s)]
*  People maybe 50 years ago, they say an implant in the heart sounds creepy. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1206.28s)]
*  Now it's like normal. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1210.3200000000002s)]
*  Twenty-five years ago, people were saying, what are you doing? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1212.0400000000002s)]
*  You're putting an implant in the brain for Parkinson's. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1215.1200000000001s)]
*  But now it is routine, part of standard of care for advanced Parkinson's. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1217.76s)]
*  This is video from the seven-hour procedure. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1223.6000000000001s)]
*  Surgery so new it didn't have a name yet. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1227.8000000000002s)]
*  Dr. Rezai opened a nickel-sized hole in Buchhalter's skull. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1230.2s)]
*  Then he directed a thin wire with four electrodes deep inside. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1234.88s)]
*  Jared, are you OK? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1239.48s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1240.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1241.48s)]
*  Jared was awake during the surgery. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1242.48s)]
*  Why was that necessary? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1244.08s)]
*  To map the brain, we have tiny microphones the size of a hair we put inside the brain [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1245.8799999999999s)]
*  and they're going slowly with micro robots. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1251.16s)]
*  They go at increments of a thousandth of a millimeter, very slow. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1253.76s)]
*  We drive them into the brain and we're listening to the neurons talking to each other. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1257.24s)]
*  In addiction, we want to find the area in the reward center so that confirms where we [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1261.44s)]
*  are in the brain. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1266.6s)]
*  Once we listen and say, OK, that's the right sound, then we put the final therapeutic pacemaker. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1268.12s)]
*  What does it sound like? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1273.8799999999999s)]
*  Static electricity, which may be electricity to you, but it's music to my ears. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1275.4399999999998s)]
*  Music because Dr. Rezai says it's a signal that he found the right spot in the brain [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1280.6s)]
*  for the implant. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1286.08s)]
*  Once in place, the wire was connected to a device placed below the collarbone. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1288.32s)]
*  The electrical pulses it sends to the brain are intended to suppress cravings. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1293.96s)]
*  Buckhalter said it was painless. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1299.28s)]
*  Post-surgery, the system is adjusted remotely with a tablet computer as needed. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1301.28s)]
*  When they turned the unit on, it was an immediate change. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1307.04s)]
*  What was the change? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1310.8400000000001s)]
*  Just felt better. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1312.64s)]
*  You know, just felt like I did prior to ever using drugs, but a little bit better. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1313.64s)]
*  It was at that point that I knew that I was going to have a legitimate shot at doing well. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1321.0400000000002s)]
*  In all, four patients with severe drug addiction had the implant surgery. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1328.88s)]
*  One had a minor relapse. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1333.5200000000002s)]
*  Another dropped out of the trial completely. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1335.48s)]
*  But two have been drug-free since their operations, including Jared Buckhalter, who's been clean [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1337.44s)]
*  for four years. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1344.0400000000002s)]
*  If you hadn't met Dr. Rezai, if you hadn't gone through this implant, do you think you'd [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1345.66s)]
*  be sitting here talking to me today? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1350.48s)]
*  You may be talking to my parents, you know, those that have lost their loved ones to a [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1353.1200000000001s)]
*  drug overdose, but you wouldn't be talking to me. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1358.76s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1362.96s)]
*  Ah, beautiful, beautiful. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1364.52s)]
*  The surgery was a success, but opening someone's skull is always risky. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1366.92s)]
*  Dr. Rezai thought he could reach more patients quickly if he used ultrasound. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1372.24s)]
*  He was already using it to treat other brain disorders and was convinced focused ultrasound [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1378.32s)]
*  could target the same area of the brain as the implant. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1383.84s)]
*  Is this brain surgery without a knife? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1387.84s)]
*  It is, indeed. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1390.04s)]
*  So there's no skin cutting, there's no opening the skull. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1391.32s)]
*  So it is brain surgery without cutting the skin, indeed. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1395.52s)]
*  Now, this is just the measuring part, right? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1398.24s)]
*  Dr. Rezai explained how his team would be the first to treat addicts by aiming hundreds [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1400.48s)]
*  of beams of ultrasound to a precise point deep inside the brain. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1405.68s)]
*  So the area that we're treating is the reward center in the brain, which is the nucleus [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1410.68s)]
*  that comes, which is right down at the base of this dark area. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1416.28s)]
*  And then we deliver ultrasound waves to that specific part of the brain and we watch how [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1422.0s)]
*  acutely on the table your cravings and your anxiety changes in response to ultrasound. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1429.44s)]
*  How is the ultrasound making a change here? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1435.36s)]
*  Ultrasound energy is changing the electrical and chemical activity in this structure in [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1439.4799999999998s)]
*  the brain involving addiction and cravings. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1446.0s)]
*  Just resetting them and giving them kind of a fresh start? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1449.6799999999998s)]
*  At this point it seems like the brain is being reset or rebooting of the brain and the cravings [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1453.6399999999999s)]
*  are less, they're managed, anxiety is better. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1458.56s)]
*  So now that allows them to interact with the therapist. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1462.62s)]
*  It's very important to know that this is not a cure but an augmentation of the therapy [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1465.3s)]
*  by reducing the cravings and anxiety that's so overwhelming that the therapist has difficulty [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1470.7399999999998s)]
*  working with the patient. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1476.4599999999998s)]
*  In February 2023, we watched Dr. Rezai use focused ultrasound to treat Dave Martin, who [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1478.02s)]
*  told us he's been surrounded by friends and family who use drugs his whole life. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1484.4599999999998s)]
*  When did you start using drugs? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1489.6999999999998s)]
*  When I was seven years old. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1491.34s)]
*  Seven? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1492.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1493.58s)]
*  I did drugs for 37 years. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1494.58s)]
*  What kind of drugs were you using? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1496.78s)]
*  Anything I can get my hands on. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1499.46s)]
*  Inside the MRI, Martin was shown these images of drug use to stoke his cravings. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1502.74s)]
*  Legs were moving a lot and he was very agitated. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1508.62s)]
*  A simultaneous brain scan allowed Dr. Rezai and his team to immediately spot the area [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1510.8999999999999s)]
*  in the nucleus accumbens that was most active. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1517.3s)]
*  I'd like to see the targets one more time. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1520.1399999999999s)]
*  90 watts of ultrasound energy were beamed at a target the size of a gumdrop. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1522.14s)]
*  Ready, sonicate. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1527.3400000000001s)]
*  Within minutes, we noticed Martin's foot that had been anxiously bouncing was still. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1530.3400000000001s)]
*  And he told Rezai's team that those same images of drugs he was shown earlier were [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1534.94s)]
*  now not sparking the need for a fix. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1540.0200000000002s)]
*  Heroin is going down. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1542.9s)]
*  Meth is also going down. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1543.9s)]
*  Marijuana is down. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1544.9s)]
*  Marijuana is down? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1545.9s)]
*  A lot, actually. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1546.9s)]
*  Good. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1547.9s)]
*  Keep on sonicating. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1548.9s)]
*  Keep on sonicating. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1550.66s)]
*  The day of the procedure, it was the best day of my life. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1553.18s)]
*  I didn't experience the same effect as like the times before. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1556.3400000000001s)]
*  You didn't feel like I need that? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1562.5400000000002s)]
*  I want that? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1564.22s)]
*  No, I didn't feel like I needed that. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1565.22s)]
*  The urge or the desire to use wasn't there anymore. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1566.22s)]
*  So within 15 to 20 minutes of treatment, the craving and anxiety melts away. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1570.42s)]
*  And we're seeing this pattern in multiple instances. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1576.22s)]
*  Then they can walk away after this? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1578.7s)]
*  Get off the table and go home. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1580.98s)]
*  And how long does this entire procedure take? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1584.1399999999999s)]
*  One hour. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1586.42s)]
*  One hour. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1587.42s)]
*  One hour. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1588.42s)]
*  Have you been around people still using drugs? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1589.42s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1591.54s)]
*  Unfortunately, I have. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1592.54s)]
*  And what happens? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1593.54s)]
*  It didn't even trigger me. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1594.54s)]
*  I used to use endurinius with needles. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1597.46s)]
*  And it was a little while ago, not too far back. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1600.7s)]
*  This one individual was trying to hit herself and they couldn't hit. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1604.62s)]
*  And they asked me, can you hit me? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1609.66s)]
*  Do you actually put drugs in this person? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1612.62s)]
*  Yeah, I actually stuck them, drew the blood back. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1615.18s)]
*  Now before when I drew the blood back, it would make me sweat because I couldn't wait [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1617.8999999999999s)]
*  to hit myself. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1622.66s)]
*  But this time it was just like, God, I hope they don't OD and I kill them here. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1623.82s)]
*  But I didn't have any urge or desire or anything. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1628.46s)]
*  Dr. Rezai's team told us Dave Martin did admit to taking one pain-killing pill at a party [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1634.22s)]
*  in December. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1640.46s)]
*  Still, 12 of the 16 patients remain drug-free throughout the three-year trial. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1641.8999999999999s)]
*  Dr. Ali Rezai is trying the same ultrasound therapy on 45 more addiction patients. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1650.62s)]
*  He's also been given FDA approval to use ultrasound... [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1657.42s)]
*  I want to get it faster. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1661.8999999999999s)]
*  ...to help people with obesity. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1663.46s)]
*  We can just do it again. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1665.54s)]
*  This is serious business. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1667.46s)]
*  Research never been done before. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1669.02s)]
*  We have to learn more. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1670.58s)]
*  We have to replicate our findings. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1671.98s)]
*  Is there any risk at running towards something quickly? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1674.06s)]
*  There's always risk. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1677.94s)]
*  But you cannot advance and make discoveries without risk. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1679.22s)]
*  But we need to push forward and take the risk because people with addiction and Alzheimer's, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1683.58s)]
*  it's not going away. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1689.7s)]
*  It's here. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1691.06s)]
*  Why wait 10, 20 years? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1692.06s)]
*  Do it now. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1694.5s)]
*  Okay, name that country. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1705.98s)]
*  It's planted opposite Europe, sitting proudly on the other side of the North Sea. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1707.62s)]
*  It's a monarchy that features its own currency, postage stamps, constitution, national anthem, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1711.94s)]
*  and a pair of handsome princes born two years apart. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1717.9s)]
*  We speak of... [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1722.18s)]
*  Sea-land. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1723.18s)]
*  A crumb of real estate off the English coast that declared its independence in 1967, Sea-land [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1724.18s)]
*  has a full-time population of one. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1729.66s)]
*  It has a landmass the size of roughly two tennis courts. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1732.6200000000001s)]
*  Its leading export might be the national mythology, a history of piracy, coups, counter-coups, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1736.3400000000001s)]
*  rogues, and offshore internet schemes. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1742.38s)]
*  It may make tiny Liechtenstein look like China by comparison. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1745.38s)]
*  But as we found out last year, by rights, Sea-land is a sovereign nation. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1749.3400000000001s)]
*  Join us as we compile some notes from a truly small island. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1753.98s)]
*  We can see Sea-land over there by the way now. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1757.98s)]
*  You see that? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1761.38s)]
*  Oh, there she is. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1762.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1763.38s)]
*  On a starboard bow. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1764.38s)]
*  Behold the world's smallest state. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1767.14s)]
*  It's a micronation in the extreme, a principality which sits, or stands, only seven miles off [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1769.98s)]
*  the coast of England. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1777.22s)]
*  Its self-described reigning monarch is this guy, Prince Michael Bates. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1778.98s)]
*  Here we are. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1783.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1784.46s)]
*  A platform and a couple of concrete husks and this is a state. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1785.46s)]
*  Yep. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1791.74s)]
*  Enter some countries, you arrive in style. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1792.9s)]
*  Here, you arrive in what's basically a backyard swing hoisted by a crank 60 feet above the [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1796.1799999999998s)]

*  Then again, when you are a sovereign nation, you, by definition, set your own rules. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1807.6599999999999s)]
*  That's a hell of a way to get into a country. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1812.8999999999999s)]
*  The only way to travel. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1815.1s)]
*  On the plus side, there's no long line at the arrivals hall. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1816.98s)]
*  I'm following you to passport control. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1820.34s)]

*  Welcome to sea land. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1837.18s)]
*  It wasn't always named sea land and it was never intended to be a country. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1841.18s)]
*  Originally called His Majesty's Ruffs Tower, it was a hastily constructed nautical fort, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1846.46s)]
*  one of several the British set up in the North Sea during World War II. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1853.14s)]
*  Equipped with anti-aircraft artillery, these forts were designed to prevent German bombing [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1858.9s)]
*  raids on London. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1863.98s)]
*  During the war, more than 100 Royal Marines were crammed into these towers for months [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1866.22s)]

*  had a monopoly on broadcasting in Britain, gave the rock bands just an hour of airtime [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1947.46s)]
*  a week. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1953.06s)]
*  The younger set in Britain, millions of them, tuned their radio knobs to the pirate stations. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1955.06s)]
*  In 1965, Prince Michael's father, Roy Bates, an enterprising swashbuckling World War II [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1963.78s)]

*  Bates set up Britain's first 24-hour outfit. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1981.98s)]
*  He called it Radio Essex. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1985.22s)]

*  And I think while this demand is here, we'll remain in business. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1995.38s)]
*  But not for long. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=1998.6s)]
*  The British government enacted a new law rendering all pirate radio stations illegal. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2000.02s)]
*  Bates was forced to shut down, but true to his nature, he was something other than scared [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2005.42s)]
*  off. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2010.82s)]

*  I mean, no. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2018.26s)]
*  Far from surrendering, Bates seized another fort, Ruff's Tower, which was outside UK territorial [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2020.1s)]

*  Instead of restarting Radio Essex, he did something bolder still. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2027.9399999999998s)]
*  On September 2nd, 1967, he declared it an independent state, sea land, and declared [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2032.3799999999999s)]
*  himself its prince. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2039.1599999999999s)]
*  It was his wife Joan's birthday. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2041.18s)]
*  And it was, of course, a hugely romantic gesture to make my mother a princess. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2043.9s)]
*  In addition to taking you out to dinner, I'm going to make you a princess. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2047.9s)]
*  He didn't take her out to dinner, but he just made her a princess, yeah. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2050.46s)]
*  Prince Roy and Princess Joan, along with their two children, Michael and Penny, set up home [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2055.38s)]
*  on sea land. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2060.14s)]
*  The sheer novelty of their lifestyle was a constant source of amusement on the mainland. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2061.6800000000003s)]

*  The start of another day, even for the new royals, is no different than for millions [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2069.18s)]
*  of others. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2072.94s)]
*  The request for a common cuppa. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2073.94s)]
*  Mrs Bates, how is it possible to keep looking glamorous in conditions like these? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2076.14s)]
*  It's no more difficult than anywhere else in the world. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2081.94s)]
*  We're quite comfortable here. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2084.54s)]
*  We have all the things I want. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2085.74s)]
*  Look, make-ups, brushes, and things. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2087.58s)]
*  At age 16, Penny was less convinced. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2090.18s)]
*  It was freezing cold, and it had no electricity. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2093.14s)]
*  To flush the toilet, you'd have to chuck a bucket over the side, drop it down about [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2096.78s)]
*  80 feet, pull it up, and flush the toilet. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2100.38s)]
*  That was your toilet? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2102.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2103.54s)]
*  The Bates family had big ambitions to turn sea land into a tax haven, a luxury island, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2104.54s)]
*  and casino. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2110.22s)]
*  And they went all in on the trappings of statehood, fashioning a flag, stamps, currency, an anthem, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2111.22s)]
*  even a national motto, Imare Libertas, from the sea of freedom. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2119.42s)]
*  As teens, Michael and Penny would spend months on sea land, holding down the fort, as it [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2127.02s)]
*  were, firing off warning shots and tossing Molotov cocktails overboard to fend off periodic [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2132.62s)]
*  attempts of invasion from rivals and buccaneers. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2138.74s)]
*  When the press eventually came out and took photographs, my father called me down and [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2142.3s)]
*  he said, now look, he said, how many times have I told you, you do not hold a gun like [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2146.82s)]
*  that? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2153.46s)]
*  You weren't holding the gun the right way. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2154.46s)]
*  And actually, if you look at the picture, the one holding the guns is dreadful. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2155.9s)]
*  Firmly settled on sea land, the Bateses remained a nuisance to the British government. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2160.02s)]
*  So much so, as a warning to the family, a team of royal engineers blew up a similar [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2165.3s)]
*  North Sea fort. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2170.86s)]

*  It's crazy, isn't it? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2202.1s)]
*  But it wasn't just the British government that wanted to dislodge the family. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2204.38s)]
*  In August 1978, a band of rogue German and Dutch lawyers and diamond merchants launched [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2208.96s)]
*  a coup d'etat with designs of founding their own offshore casino. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2214.52s)]
*  They arrived by helicopter, with a film crew in tow, taking Prince Michael by surprise [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2219.16s)]
*  and then roughing him up. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2224.52s)]
*  They tied my elbow together, my knees together, my feet together, my hands down to my knees, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2226.36s)]
*  and they picked me up and they swung the other in German. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2231.6s)]
*  Let's chuck this bastard over the side, he's too much trouble. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2234.2400000000002s)]
*  You're a full on political prisoner right now. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2237.52s)]
*  Sea land had fallen. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2241.04s)]
*  After three days, Michael was released. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2242.88s)]
*  Did Michael and his father then return via helicopter, fully armed and flanked by a group [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2245.84s)]
*  of bruisers to stage a successful countercoup? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2250.66s)]
*  Yes, yes they did. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2253.88s)]
*  I jumped and landed, crash in the middle of the Germans. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2256.52s)]
*  The sawed-off shotgun hit the deck, boom, and all the Germans went like that. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2259.56s)]
*  Surrender, that's it. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2263.88s)]
*  You've reclaimed your principality. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2265.12s)]
*  Disarmed, the plotters were released, all except for one. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2267.7599999999998s)]
*  His name was Putz. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2271.52s)]
*  And he was made to clean the bathroom, make coffee, and imposed a fine for treason, $37,000. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2273.08s)]
*  His imprisonment brought a German diplomat to sea land. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2281.3599999999997s)]
*  But if you have German emissaries coming here to try and negotiate the release of this prisoner, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2284.68s)]
*  doesn't that imply that sea land is a state that's having relations? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2291.52s)]
*  Absolutely, it's de facto recognition, hasn't it happened? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2296.12s)]
*  This diplomatic visit was critical for the Bates family. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2300.08s)]
*  An international treaty signed in the 1930s established four requirements for statehood. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2303.68s)]
*  One is recognition by another state. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2310.12s)]

*  I do most of the engineering work, electrically and whatever. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2325.12s)]

*  If need be, yes. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2341.52s)]

*  In the early 2000s, they partnered with fringe internet entrepreneurs who invested millions [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2351.84s)]

*  which my father was against. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2381.68s)]
*  Gambling and porn is okay, but we draw a line at harvesting human organs. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2383.52s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2387.04s)]
*  That venture failed dismally. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2389.2s)]

*  The Bates family won't disclose the size of the national debt or the yearly budget, but [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2397.18s)]
*  it is serviced through the online sale of noble titles. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2402.12s)]
*  Become a lord or lady for $30. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2406.04s)]
*  $600 will make you a sea land duke or duchess. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2408.96s)]
*  People are buying these titles. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2412.92s)]
*  What is that all about? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2414.4s)]

*  That national myth, the very idea of sea land, has now far outgrown the country itself. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2430.96s)]
*  As for the House of Bates, well, Roy and Joan have passed on. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2437.2400000000002s)]
*  And the rest of the lineage lives in the small English resort town of Southend-on-Sea. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2441.76s)]

*  Is this the golden age for sea land? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2473.92s)]
*  Hopefully. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EfX25igUbc&t=2476.8399999999997s)]
