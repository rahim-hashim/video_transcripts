*  It sounded like you was at the ocean, and it looked like the ocean except it was dirtier, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  muddier. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=217.5s)]

*  In front of here? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=221.62s)]

*  the family has run for more than 60 years. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=242.74s)]
*  She took this video from the second floor. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=246.66000000000003s)]
*  We have two doors down that way outside, and then we have this back one. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=250.02s)]
*  We tried to block them, and you don't stop water. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=254.9s)]
*  It busted through the back door, and then it started coming in the front door. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=257.7s)]
*  The water's coming through the store? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=262.06s)]
*  It came three different ways. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=263.46000000000004s)]
*  So when we got up there, and we stood on the steps and watched it come in, and all we could [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  do is just sit and watch it and pray that it didn't get no higher. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=270.54s)]
*  It came up to the seventh step. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=274.94s)]
*  This is what those answered prayers look like today. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=279.58000000000004s)]
*  Only the skeleton of the family's store is left. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=283.1s)]
*  Her father's old cash register is clogged with mud, and her mother's home was destroyed. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=286.02000000000004s)]
*  She's 96. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=292.62s)]
*  She's raised seven kids and worked 16, 18 hours a day. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=293.94s)]
*  It's really hard for her, but my mom got up the next morning singing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=299.54s)]
*  Singing? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=303.54s)]
*  Singing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=304.54s)]
*  When the road is cold up yonder, I'll be there. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=305.54s)]
*  A hymn about the expectations of a home in heaven. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=310.06s)]
*  On her front lawn, 96-year-old Parzadeh Whitson shared it with us, surrounded by what's left [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=314.02s)]
*  of her home on Green Mountain. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=320.21999999999997s)]
*  When the road is cold up yonder, I'll be there. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=323.02s)]
*  For so many, this was their slice of heaven. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=328.58s)]
*  Living in the haulers, the communities built in the valleys of the Appalachian Mountains. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=331.9s)]
*  What do you do next as a family? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=337.74s)]
*  We keep going. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=340.38000000000005s)]
*  It's what we've always done. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=341.38000000000005s)]
*  I've not been a whole lot of places, but I would never go nowhere else to live. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=342.86s)]
*  Everybody knows everybody. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=349.22s)]
*  And if you need a hand, we're there. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=351.98s)]
*  We'll do anything we can to help you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=354.74s)]
*  This is home? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=356.90000000000003s)]
*  This is home. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=357.90000000000003s)]
*  I call it God's country. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=359.26000000000005s)]
*  I know everybody says that because where they live, but this little piece of western North [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=360.26000000000005s)]
*  Carolina is just, the mountains are just, they're magical. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=366.46000000000004s)]
*  Jeff Howe's family has lived in the area for seven generations. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=370.98s)]
*  Howe is the Emergency Management Coordinator for Yancey County, an area that was hit hard [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=376.22s)]
*  by Helene. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=381.62s)]
*  The devastation caught most residents by surprise. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=384.62s)]
*  Western North Carolina hasn't seen anything like this since the Great Flood of 1916, when [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=389.14s)]
*  two storms converged and pushed rivers over their banks. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=395.9s)]
*  It's going to hit the pool there right here. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=399.82s)]
*  Forecasters say this time, the stage was set for disaster well before Helene roared in. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=401.94s)]
*  Days earlier, a weather front stalled over the mountains. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=409.97999999999996s)]
*  Some areas got more than a foot of rain. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=413.7s)]
*  When Helene arrived, these mountains were already saturated. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=417.21999999999997s)]
*  There had been three days of rain. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=420.94s)]
*  Streaks and streams rerouted and grew bigger and stronger. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=423.02000000000004s)]
*  There was nowhere for all that water to go but down, and it took everything in its path [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=427.38s)]
*  with it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=432.78000000000003s)]
*  We started getting the entrapments, the landslide calls, and the most worrisome thing about [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=434.26s)]
*  it is when the calls stopped because we had no radio communication, we had no cell phone, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=442.14000000000004s)]
*  we had no internet. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  You couldn't talk to anyone, and that was terrifying. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=450.72s)]
*  Forty-five miles to the south, Asheville, which sits in a valley of the Blue Ridge Mountains, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=455.20000000000005s)]
*  acted as a catch basin for the water that funneled down the Appalachians, triggering [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=461.16s)]
*  landslides along the way. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=468.20000000000005s)]
*  The two rivers that intersect with the city swelled to the highest levels in history. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=472.88000000000005s)]
*  The water was so strong, it pushed homes off their foundations and lifted a 10,000-pound [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=478.14000000000004s)]
*  tractor trailer into the treetops. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=486.12s)]
*  Rescue crews wound through the city on boats. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=489.90000000000003s)]
*  Radios, cell phones, and the internet were knocked out. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=492.62s)]
*  Up in Yancey County, they couldn't call for help or wait for it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=496.38s)]
*  We basically just abandoned the Emergency Operations Center, and the sheriff's department, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=501.86s)]
*  they were already out doing rescues. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=508.90000000000003s)]
*  But we would just go in, give me another name, and we'd take off and try to find these people [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=511.1s)]
*  and get them. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=517.14s)]
*  A local firefighter and his wife were among those rescued. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=518.14s)]
*  He and his wife were asleep in their house when the flood washed it off the foundation, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=522.32s)]
*  and they were floating down where the river became, and it shoved them through the wall [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=527.34s)]
*  of their house. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=534.84s)]
*  They hung onto a tree for two or three hours until they were found, but then the next day [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=536.3000000000001s)]
*  he was at work. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=542.0s)]
*  His face was scratched all to pieces, bandaged up, but that's the kind of people we had. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=543.0s)]
*  I say we work our way this way up here. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=548.38s)]
*  More than 70 search and rescue teams from across the country were dispatched to North Carolina. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=550.64s)]

*  But what I can do is, you know, working with the people around here and keep the miscommunications [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=686.74s)]
*  down is the best thing I can do right now. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=692.82s)]

*  Jeff Howe is now dealing with a storm of disinformation. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=697.98s)]
*  He told us conspiracy theories and false claims about the government's response to the flood [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=702.0200000000001s)]

*  that is really not happening. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=719.1s)]
*  How does that impact workers on the ground? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=721.0s)]
*  It takes their focus away from what they're supposed to be doing when they're having to [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=723.64s)]
*  debunk this sort of stuff and explain to people, no, the U.S. government did not geo-engineer [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=728.72s)]
*  this storm. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=735.88s)]
*  But, like I said, some people, they're going to believe it no matter what. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=736.88s)]
*  The day after we spoke to Howe, a neighboring county was investigating reports of an armed [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=740.84s)]
*  militia, quote, hunting FEMA. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=745.84s)]
*  An arrest was made. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=748.24s)]
*  FEMA suspended door-to-door operations in western North Carolina for 48 hours. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=751.04s)]
*  But the agency reports all operations have resumed. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=757.16s)]
*  This is one of the areas still in need of help, a place curiously called Relief. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=762.32s)]
*  This is the old post office. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=767.88s)]
*  You used to play in here? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  We did. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=772.08s)]
*  James Warwick told us the area was named after a medicine the town doctor sold in the 1800s [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=773.24s)]
*  that provided relief to its patrons. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=779.24s)]
*  The main ingredient was alcohol. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=782.0s)]
*  Warwick and his mother, Jewel, have lived in that same doctor's house for the past 55 [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=785.84s)]
*  years. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=791.0s)]
*  Today, it is buried in mud. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=792.0s)]
*  Less than 1 percent of residents in the hardest-hit areas of western North Carolina have flood [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=795.32s)]
*  insurance. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=800.48s)]
*  What was it like before? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=801.88s)]
*  Life was wonderful. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=803.88s)]
*  It was wonderful. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=805.36s)]
*  Were we to sit up here somewhere? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=806.36s)]
*  James and Jewel evacuated days before the storm and say they encouraged their neighbors [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=807.5600000000001s)]
*  to leave as well. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=812.88s)]
*  But by the time they tried, it was too late. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=814.52s)]
*  There was a wall of water that came down the river that engulfed this area. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=817.4s)]
*  And that's probably the same wall of water that took our neighbors with it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=822.2s)]
*  So we are the only two surviving people here in relief. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=825.72s)]
*  Six of our neighbors have died. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=831.6s)]
*  That is what's left of the car the couple next door and her two young boys tried to [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=835.36s)]
*  escape in. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=839.76s)]
*  It was crushed by water so powerful it twisted the train tracks in town. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=841.0400000000001s)]
*  More than three weeks after the storm, crews are still searching the debris along the rivers. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=848.12s)]
*  In North Carolina, at least 125 people were killed by Helene. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=853.72s)]
*  More than 50 are still missing. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=858.64s)]
*  Across the Appalachian Mountains, the road to relief will be a long one. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=863.28s)]
*  I'm still in shock. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=868.16s)]
*  I mean, I carry on a laugh and a joke and I take my time. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=869.16s)]

*  I'm not going to keep silent. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1105.34s)]
*  He called Putin a madman who was sucking the blood out of Russia and more insults as he [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1108.1799999999998s)]
*  built a pro-democracy movement opening offices all across Russia. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1114.74s)]
*  It was a time when other Putin opponents were dying in suspicious suicides, a car bombing. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1120.3799999999999s)]
*  Dissident Boris Nemtsov was shot out in the open near the Kremlin, and Navalny himself [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1128.22s)]
*  was subjected to multiple arrests and beatings, an attack with green dye laced with a caustic [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1133.62s)]
*  chemical, and in 2020, an assassination attempt that he recounts in the beginning of his book. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1140.4199999999998s)]
*  He writes that shortly before he boarded a plane in Siberia, he was poisoned with a Soviet-era [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1148.1399999999999s)]
*  military-grade nerve agent. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1154.86s)]
*  He collapsed, moaning in agony, as his body began to shut down. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1160.82s)]
*  While he was in a coma at a Russian hospital, Yulia waged a campaign to pressure Putin to [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1170.02s)]
*  release Alexei so he could fly to Germany for treatment. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1176.1399999999999s)]
*  We met them in Berlin about two months after the attack. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1180.94s)]
*  You have said you think that Mr. Putin's responsible. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1185.24s)]
*  I don't think I'm sure that he's responsible. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1189.1s)]
*  He spent five months recovering in Germany. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1193.1s)]
*  That's when he started writing the memoir. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1196.78s)]
*  Then in January of 2021, the Navalnys returned to Russia. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1200.1399999999999s)]
*  When they landed, they were met by Russian police. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1206.78s)]
*  He was arrested, said goodbye to his wife, and was led away. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1212.58s)]
*  This is a question you're going to be asked over and over and over, but it's almost the [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1218.58s)]
*  essential question. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1224.82s)]
*  Why did you decide to go back, the two of you? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1227.3799999999999s)]
*  You knew the danger for sure, and do you regret it now? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1232.46s)]
*  You asked me about our decision. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1236.8999999999999s)]
*  Like we were sitting together and discussing if he needs to go back or he doesn't need [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1242.1799999999998s)]
*  to go back. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1248.14s)]
*  It didn't work like this. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1249.14s)]
*  From the first day when I realized that he could recover after this poisoning, I knew [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1252.18s)]
*  that he would go back as soon as possible. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1259.18s)]
*  So it wasn't even a debate? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1263.38s)]
*  No. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1264.7s)]
*  When do we go back as opposed to if? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1265.7s)]
*  We never had any debates, and of course I would love to live all my life with my husband. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1267.7s)]
*  But at that moment I knew that there is just one decision which he could take, and it was [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1273.18s)]
*  his decision. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1282.22s)]
*  And I knew how important it was for him. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1283.7s)]
*  And I knew that he wouldn't be happy to live in exile. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1287.42s)]
*  His arrest sparked protests across Russia. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1296.3s)]
*  But far from disappearing in prison, Navalny managed to maintain a presence on social [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1300.1s)]
*  media. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1305.9399999999998s)]
*  How, we've been asked not to say, but it enabled him to keep up his attacks on Putin. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1306.9399999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, his team of investigators released drone footage of what they said was Putin's [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1313.62s)]
*  billion-dollar palace on the Black Sea. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1319.4599999999998s)]
*  It was viewed more than a hundred million times on YouTube. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1322.8999999999999s)]
*  It must have driven Putin insane that he locked him up and he's still getting the anti-Putin [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1327.22s)]
*  message out. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1335.38s)]
*  That's why his conditions were worse from month to month. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1336.38s)]
*  Those conditions Navalny wrote in his diaries included sleep deprivation, punitive solitary [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1344.24s)]
*  confinement, almost no medical care. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1351.1000000000001s)]
*  And when none of that broke him, he was sent repeatedly to a concrete black hole called [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1355.02s)]
*  the punishment cell, where he would remain for up to 15 days at a time. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1361.26s)]
*  Here's how he described it. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1367.02s)]
*  He said it was a dog house. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1368.54s)]
*  And this is the place where prisoners were sent to be tortured and raped and sometimes [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1371.26s)]
*  murdered. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1376.26s)]
*  I wondered how you read those passages. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1377.5s)]
*  I was thinking of you when I read it and thought, what does she feel? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1381.1s)]
*  How are you reading this? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1385.1s)]
*  It's very tough moment for him to think about all these torturing place and torturing conditions [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1386.54s)]
*  and about him, how he was laughing at these people even while he was there. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1394.74s)]
*  Navalny thought of his life in prison as his work, surviving and staying positive his job. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1406.98s)]
*  I know one thing for sure, he wrote, that I'm among the happiest 1% of people on the [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1413.66s)]
*  planet, those who absolutely adore their work. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1419.0200000000002s)]
*  I have enormous support from the people and I met a woman with whom I share not only love, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1423.66s)]
*  but who is just as opposed as I am to what is going on. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1430.3000000000002s)]
*  Maybe we won't succeed, but we have to try. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1434.62s)]
*  He wrote much of this book while he was in prison. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1438.3s)]
*  He was under constant surveillance, cameras on him all the time, and he managed to get [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1441.6599999999999s)]
*  the pages out. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1448.1399999999999s)]
*  Alexei was very smart, very inventive. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1449.58s)]
*  Let me read you what he says in the book about this. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1453.78s)]
*  He says, I had to devise a whole clandestine operation to bamboozle the guards involving [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1457.62s)]
*  the substitution of identical notebooks and after that we went to court where I was able [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1464.28s)]
*  physically to pass items to someone. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1471.6s)]
*  It was very difficult, that's why we have diaries from the first year, much less from [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1474.04s)]
*  the second year and not from the third year because it wasn't possible. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1480.8s)]
*  These are some of the diaries he smuggled out when he went to court, which was often [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1486.6s)]
*  as he was tried and convicted several times on various pretexts. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1492.6000000000001s)]
*  After each verdict, he was moved to a different prison with harsher conditions. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1498.2s)]
*  Last December, he was transferred to this penal colony north of the Arctic Circle. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1505.3600000000001s)]
*  This would be his final court appearance. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1512.96s)]
*  He looked healthy and in good spirits, sharing a laugh with court officials. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1515.8200000000002s)]
*  The very next day, February 16, 2024, he was dead. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1521.52s)]
*  Russian officials announced later that the cause was, quote, not criminal in nature and [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1527.32s)]
*  due to combined diseases. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1532.76s)]
*  It was at the time that the negotiations over a prisoner swap were underway and Alexei might [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1535.6399999999999s)]
*  be one of the prisoners who was to be released. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1543.6399999999999s)]
*  Putin realized that Alexei is so big that he could be a new leader of Russia. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1546.8s)]
*  He could encourage people to stand against Putin and all these things just brought Putin [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1553.96s)]
*  to this understanding that it's not possible to let Navalny be free. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1564.76s)]
*  You posted a message shortly after his death. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1572.32s)]
*  You said, bravely, I thought, Vladimir Putin killed my husband. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1577.08s)]
*  By killing Alexei, Putin killed half of me, half of my heart, and half of my soul. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1583.48s)]
*  That's true. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1590.48s)]
*  I can say now the same. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1593.8799999999999s)]
*  Nothing has changed. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1595.8s)]
*  Here's something else you said. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1597.76s)]
*  You posted this on X. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1599.24s)]
*  Please do not forget, Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1602.52s)]
*  His place is in prison and not somewhere in the Hague in a cozy cell with a TV, but in [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1608.88s)]
*  Russia in the same two by three meter cell in which he killed Alexei. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1615.6s)]
*  For me, it's very important. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1621.0s)]
*  I think that for Vladimir Putin, he needs to be in Russian prison to feel everything, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1624.28s)]
*  what not just my husband, but all the prisoners in Russia. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1632.52s)]
*  His political network inside Russia has been crushed. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1637.3799999999999s)]
*  Yulia and their two children have been forced to live in exile. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1641.68s)]
*  Many of his old team now operate out of here in Vilnius, Lithuania, and three of his lawyers [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1646.62s)]
*  are on trial in Russia. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1653.44s)]
*  I'm so happy you're here. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1655.6399999999999s)]
*  And Yulia is constantly on the road, lobbying Western leaders to stand up to Putin. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1657.68s)]
*  So the question is inevitable, painful, but inevitable. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1665.2s)]
*  Has Putin won? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1670.46s)]
*  Has he shut down the opposition to such an extent that it's over? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1672.2s)]
*  But it's not finished. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1679.12s)]
*  We continue our fight. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1680.32s)]
*  He still has millions of supporters. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1682.32s)]
*  We can see it by how many people go still every day to his grave. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1684.9199999999998s)]
*  How many flowers on his grave. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1693.3999999999999s)]
*  For all the polarization in American politics, everyone can agree that seven states hold [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1696.4s)]
*  the key to next month's election. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1714.3200000000002s)]
*  These swing states contain a total of 513 counties, and among them, only one has voted [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1716.68s)]
*  for the winning candidate in every presidential election this century. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1722.28s)]
*  Door County, Wisconsin offers a distinct shade of purple. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1726.56s)]
*  Unencumbered by tribal loyalties, the citizenry is whipsawed from George W. Bush twice to [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1730.32s)]
*  Barack Obama twice to Donald Trump and then to Joe Biden. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1736.2s)]
*  Consider Door a window into this critical election. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1740.76s)]
*  Feverishly, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have been campaigning in swing states, especially [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1743.6s)]
*  But neither has visited America's swingiest county. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1749.96s)]
*  So we decided to. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1753.92s)]
*  The Wisconsin Tourism Board could do worse than to anchor its next marketing campaign [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1757.08s)]
*  in Door County, the peninsula wedged between Lake Michigan and Green Bay, the water, not [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1761.7s)]
*  the home of the Packers. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1767.48s)]
*  Nicknamed the Cape Cod of the Midwest, Door County and its coastline come embroidered [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1769.1200000000001s)]

*  And this is where we're at. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1805.2s)]
*  Door County is up the thumb of Wisconsin. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1807.08s)]
*  And Green Bay is down here, Milwaukee is down here, and we're about right here on the peninsula. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1811.44s)]
*  We got a bay side and we got a Lake Michigan side. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1817.6s)]

*  Tell me, politically, what are people like? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1820.96s)]
*  Well, politically, we were strictly Republicans. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1823.76s)]
*  And then the transplants came, and now Door County is the ultimate political weathervane. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1828.96s)]
*  In 2020, Joe Biden carried Door County by 292 votes, the tightest margin in any Wisconsin [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1834.52s)]

*  a lot of people that came here from the cities and from the suburbs and retired. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1858.6399999999999s)]

*  that's most going to impact how you vote? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=1894.92s)]

*  Whoa! [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2014.36s)]
*  On cue. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2015.36s)]

*  On cue. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2017.36s)]
*  We are very purple. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2018.36s)]
*  That is our impression from moving up here, is that we are very, very purple. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2019.36s)]

*  What's a positive response look like? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2032.44s)]
*  Positive response can be anything from just a nod of the head to an enthusiastic wave, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2034.68s)]
*  a horn honk, a solid horn honk, thumbs up. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2039.52s)]
*  Do you have data on raised thumbs versus raised middle fingers? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2043.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, that happens too. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2046.48s)]
*  Oh, you get those too. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2047.48s)]
*  But I would say on... [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2048.48s)]
*  I have a pretty good sample size and we run well over 80% positive to the negative. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2051.96s)]
*  For a more scientific assessment of the entire state of Wisconsin, we turned to the director [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2058.56s)]
*  of the Marquette Law School poll, Charles Franklin. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2063.72s)]
*  His poll, widely considered Wisconsin's best, currently has Kamala Harris up four, but not [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2067.12s)]
*  so fast. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2073.08s)]
*  What is it like being a pollster these days? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2074.6s)]
*  That's challenging because we've seen polling errors in 2016 and 2020 and those were major [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2077.6s)]
*  issues. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2083.4s)]
*  Memorably, in 2016 and 2020, most polls, CBS included, fell short when accounting for the [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2084.4s)]
*  Trump vote. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2091.48s)]
*  There's something specific, particular to Trump that makes his support hard to capture. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2092.68s)]
*  In these four most recent elections, the two big errors have both come when Trump's on [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2097.6s)]
*  the ballot and the two elections without him on the ballot, we've been as good or better [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2102.08s)]
*  than our long-term average. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2107.2s)]
*  Say more about why you think that is. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2109.3999999999996s)]
*  The people that Trump mobilizes to vote really do turn out for him, but they seem to drop [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2111.3199999999997s)]
*  out of the electorate in the midterm. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2118.16s)]
*  My suspicion is it keeps the Kamala Harris campaign up all night long. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2120.56s)]
*  That there's this cohort that hasn't been captureable. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2125.72s)]
*  Correct. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2129.04s)]
*  Brian Schimming, Wisconsin's Republican Party Chair, is shaking the trees to identify those [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2130.24s)]

*  How many potential Trump supporters are there in Wisconsin who have never voted before? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2140.28s)]
*  Well, I spoke at President Trump's rally the other day and I said to the folks there, look, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2145.6800000000003s)]
*  there are hundreds of thousands of people in this state who think like us, they act [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2150.76s)]
*  like us, they live like us, they believe like us, but they don't vote. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2155.84s)]
*  And I truly believe that. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2161.2400000000002s)]
*  Is it risky to rely on this sector, these low propensity voters who have been so unreliable [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2163.12s)]
*  in the past? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2168.8s)]
*  It's risky not to. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2169.8s)]
*  Make sure that they get out to vote. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2170.8s)]
*  For the Democrats, the strategy entails running up the numbers in Milwaukee and booming Dane [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2173.52s)]
*  County, home to Madison, the state capitol and the University of Wisconsin, where Biden [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2178.96s)]
*  won more than 75 percent of the vote in 2020. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2183.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, they'll try to stanch the bleeding in rural swaths that have swung heavily towards [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2187.4s)]
*  Trump. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2192.36s)]
*  Are you ready to organize? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2193.36s)]
*  Ben Wickler, state Democratic Party chair, thinks it's a complete jump ball right now [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2195.08s)]
*  for Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2199.88s)]

*  And when you find out who won Wisconsin, which might happen at four in the morning, you probably [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2206.84s)]
*  know who won the presidential election. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2211.08s)]
*  It's that pivotal. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2213.08s)]
*  Wisconsin was the state that tipped the electoral college for Donald Trump in 2016. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2214.92s)]
*  There is every possibility that Wisconsin could tip the presidential election again [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2219.28s)]
*  in 2024. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2223.5600000000004s)]
*  Wisconsin was decided by less than one percent in the last two elections. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2225.4s)]
*  But get this, around 80 percent of the state's counties were decided by a double digit margin, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2229.28s)]
*  which only magnifies Door County's uncanny distinction. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2235.1200000000003s)]
*  I think in Door County, this election is almost perfectly tied as well. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2239.32s)]
*  I was just looking at the county by county data before I joined you today. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2243.32s)]
*  Whoever wins Door County on election day probably wins the state of Wisconsin yet again. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2247.36s)]
*  You say whoever wins Door County likely wins Wisconsin. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2252.44s)]
*  You also just said whoever wins Wisconsin likely wins the national election. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2255.0800000000004s)]
*  Not an exaggeration. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2258.56s)]
*  Door County, Wisconsin. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2260.28s)]
*  Historically the case. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2261.28s)]
*  Whoever wins in Door County is probably the next president of the United States. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2262.34s)]
*  It got us thinking. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2265.76s)]
*  Is there one person in Door County who's actually picked the winning candidate in each of the [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2266.76s)]
*  last six presidential elections? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2271.28s)]
*  The county did collectively, but did any single voter. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2273.64s)]
*  If so, finding this mystery figure might provide a heck of a clue into how this presidential [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2277.3199999999997s)]
*  election will go. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2282.6s)]
*  So we went on a search. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2284.2s)]
*  We started with an APB at the local radio station. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2289.2s)]
*  But no response. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2300.7599999999998s)]
*  From the airwaves to the rooftops, Al Johnson's Swedish restaurant is best known for the goats [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2302.46s)]
*  that graze on the grass roof. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2307.5s)]
*  Inside we found the locals who beat the sunrise and the tourists, let themselves into the [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2310.02s)]
*  back door and pour their own coffee. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2314.96s)]
*  Do you know anyone that's voted for president six straight years now and gotten it right? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2317.14s)]
*  No. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2323.9s)]
*  No. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2324.9s)]
*  We were told to go to another table and ask the guy in the hat. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2325.9s)]
*  We got a hot tip. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2329.32s)]
*  No, I had some of them. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2331.1800000000003s)]
*  George HW was my vote, but not his son. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2332.52s)]
*  Next stop in our pursuit, the local watering hole. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2338.84s)]
*  Do you know that person? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2341.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm out. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2343.6400000000003s)]
*  I do not. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2344.6400000000003s)]
*  You have your work cut out for you. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2345.84s)]
*  Then suddenly, a promising lead. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2348.4s)]
*  I didn't even found your voter. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2350.56s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2353.8s)]
*  Right over there. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2354.8s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2356.8s)]

*  Five out of six? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2370.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2371.5600000000004s)]
*  I heard votes for Biden. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2372.5600000000004s)]

*  Three times in a row. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2382.5600000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2384.5600000000004s)]
*  We had come agonizingly close. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2385.5600000000004s)]
*  Our last stop, the Rotary Club of Sturgeon Bay. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2388.32s)]
*  I'm curious, does anyone know someone, a voter, who actually voted for the winning candidate [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2393.32s)]
*  all six years? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2399.6s)]
*  Anyone? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2401.16s)]
*  Oh, I think I did. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2402.16s)]
*  You did? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2404.16s)]

*  Yes. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2406.16s)]
*  I think I did. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2407.16s)]

*  No, no, no, no, I didn't. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2410.16s)]
*  Now that I think about it. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2411.16s)]
*  You thought you had all six. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2412.16s)]
*  I thought I did. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2413.16s)]

*  I didn't. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2415.16s)]
*  After scouring Door County, we came up empty, which shows the improbability of it all. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2416.16s)]
*  But in our quest, maybe we stumbled across something even more rare. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2423.92s)]
*  We found a place in America where family and community outrank party loyalty. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2428.44s)]
*  In this divisive election season, we came to America's ultimate battleground, except [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2433.6s)]

*  It was a luxury cruise ship. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2764.78s)]
*  It was a luxury cruise liner. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2765.78s)]
*  Absolutely was. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2768.1000000000004s)]
*  The Cap Arcona traversed the Atlantic dozens of times, but in 1933, Germany underwent a [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2769.94s)]
*  sea change. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2776.7400000000002s)]
*  Adolf Hitler came to power. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2780.86s)]
*  In 1939, as German troops invaded Poland, the Nazis commandeered the Cap Arcona to serve [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2785.86s)]
*  as a floating barracks in the Baltic. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2792.82s)]
*  Ironically, on one of its last trips before the war, the ocean liner carried some German-Jewish [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2795.46s)]
*  passengers who had bought tickets to safety in South America. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2801.5s)]

*  We were rounded up and sent to the concentration camp. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2809.6600000000003s)]
*  Just the three of us, my mother, I, and my younger brother. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2813.06s)]
*  94-year-old Manfred Goldberg was just 11 when the Nazis forcibly removed him and other Jews [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2817.58s)]

*  He would survive confinement in the Riga Latvia ghetto and four different concentration camps. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2827.58s)]
*  The cruel experiences during my young years between 11 and 15, they're firmly lodged [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2834.18s)]

*  In Nazi-held Latvia, Goldberg, his mother Rosa, and other prisoners were forced to repair [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2846.18s)]
*  bombed-out railroad tracks during the day. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2851.98s)]

*  They just disappeared off the face of the earth. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2865.7s)]
*  The next morning, both my mother and I had to line up and go to work as though nothing [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2868.4599999999996s)]
*  untoward had happened. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2874.14s)]
*  What did that do to you and your mother? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2875.8599999999997s)]
*  I was nearly as heartbroken as my mother at the loss of her little baby, so to speak. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2877.56s)]
*  He was seven when he went into the camps and nine the day he disappeared. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2884.7599999999998s)]
*  Goldberg and his mother ended up in the Stutthof camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2890.1s)]
*  Another young boy, George Schwab, was imprisoned there too. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2895.7s)]
*  The crematoria, burning of bodies all the time, gassing, terrible. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2899.82s)]
*  Schwab is 92, but he was only nine when German soldiers invaded his hometown of Liepaja, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2906.9s)]
*  Latvia. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2913.94s)]
*  Schwab's father, a prominent physician, tried to protect other Jews in town. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2915.02s)]
*  He noticed SS trucks were approaching and he waved for fellow Jews to disperse. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2920.62s)]
*  And they arrested him, knocked out one eye, threw him down the cellar, and then killed him. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2930.42s)]
*  Bruno's father, Willy Neuwerath, was not Jewish, but he actively opposed the Nazi regime. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2938.58s)]
*  My parents belonged to the small minority of German people who fighted against the Nazis. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2944.78s)]
*  They didn't fight with weapons, of course. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2950.9s)]
*  Fight with their words. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2952.6600000000003s)]
*  Yes, fighting with papers, with printed papers. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2953.98s)]
*  Willy was arrested for distributing anti-fascist flyers. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2957.3s)]
*  They brought them to Buchenwald and from Buchenwald they brought him to the concentration camp [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2961.5800000000004s)]
*  Neuengamme by Hamburg. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2967.3s)]
*  The Neuengamme work camp mostly held political prisoners. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2970.22s)]
*  Inside this massive warehouse, historian Bill Niven told us prisoners like Willy Neuwerath [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2974.22s)]
*  made bricks. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2980.62s)]
*  What does it feel like to walk in here? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2981.62s)]
*  It feels like a factory of death. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2984.4199999999996s)]
*  You can sense what went on in this place. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2986.2s)]
*  But this was not a death camp, this was a work camp. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2988.8199999999997s)]
*  It's a very, very slim distinction. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2992.4599999999996s)]
*  In the course of this work, they die. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2994.7999999999997s)]
*  They die in droves. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2997.22s)]
*  Willy Neuwerath managed to survive. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=2999.34s)]
*  But as fate would have it, he, Schwab, the Goldbergs and the Cap Arcona all would end [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3002.1800000000003s)]
*  up at Lubik Bay, one of the last Nazi defensive positions. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3008.1400000000003s)]
*  In 1945, as the Allies were closing in, the Cap Arcona, now rusted and battered, was repositioned [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3013.9s)]
*  to Lubik Bay. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3021.58s)]
*  At the same time, SS Chief Heinrich Himmler ordered the evacuation of concentration camps. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3023.3s)]
*  Why were they trying to clear these places up? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3030.42s)]
*  There is an order by Himmler that no prisoner is to be delivered into the hands of the enemy [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3032.76s)]
*  alive. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3037.9s)]
*  But I think the main concern was to get rid of evidence, because prisoners are evidence. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3038.9s)]
*  They can talk, they can tell, they can speak to those atrocities that were committed by [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3042.98s)]
*  the Nazis. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3047.0600000000004s)]
*  So getting rid of the evidence meant getting rid of human beings. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3048.0600000000004s)]
*  Thousands of prisoners were sent to the Nazi holdout at Lubik Bay. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3052.86s)]
*  Willy Neuwerath was forced north from Neuengammer, about 50 miles. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3056.98s)]
*  From Stutthof in the east, Manfred Goldberg, his mother, and George Schwab were sent to [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3062.2200000000003s)]
*  a nearby town aptly named Hell and put on barges. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3067.7200000000003s)]
*  What were the conditions? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3072.9s)]
*  Oh, terrible. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3073.9s)]
*  Just beyond description. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3075.34s)]
*  No toilet facilities, hardly any food. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3076.94s)]
*  You could hardly sit. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3080.88s)]
*  You could certainly not sleep. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3082.06s)]
*  Something hell. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3083.7200000000003s)]
*  Hell. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3084.7200000000003s)]
*  Hell on earth. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3085.7200000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3086.7200000000003s)]
*  The barges, each packed with about a thousand prisoners, were towed by tugboat for six days, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3087.7200000000003s)]
*  about 400 miles across the Baltic, to where the Cap Arcona was positioned. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3094.12s)]
*  The Cap Arcona arrived in Lubik Bay on April 14, 1945, two weeks before Hitler killed himself [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3100.7200000000003s)]
*  and three weeks before the end of the war in Europe. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3108.12s)]
*  It was anchored out there, about two miles offshore. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3111.2799999999997s)]
*  With its engines barely running and little in the way of food and water, the former queen [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3115.0s)]
*  of the Atlantic, a playground for the rich and famous, was about to become a floating [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3120.7599999999998s)]
*  concentration camp. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3126.3799999999997s)]
*  With nowhere to hold the amassed prisoners, SS guards jammed more than 4,000, including [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3128.98s)]
*  Willy Neuwerath, onto the Cap Arcona. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3135.22s)]
*  One must remember this is a ship that's meant for 1,500 people. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3139.0s)]
*  It's not meant for 4,000 to 5,000 prisoners. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3142.2400000000002s)]
*  Do we know what the Nazis intended to do with the prisoners on the ship? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3145.0800000000004s)]
*  I think they intended them to die. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3150.7200000000003s)]
*  Prisoners already were dying on the barges fleeing Stutthof, carrying Schwab and the [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3154.4s)]
*  Goldbergs. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3159.2400000000002s)]
*  Once in the bay, the SS guards uncoupled the tugboats, leaving the prisoners adrift. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3160.88s)]
*  They just abandoned you. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3166.96s)]
*  They abandoned you. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3168.4s)]
*  We were left alone, supposedly on mine fields. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3169.4s)]
*  Schwab and Goldberg told us, mixed in with the concentration camp victims, were a few [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3173.8s)]
*  prisoners of war. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3178.84s)]
*  They had been better fed and better treated, and they seized the opportunity. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3180.6800000000003s)]
*  They managed to prise loose some very long floorboards and began using these planks of [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3185.8s)]
*  wood as oars. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3191.1600000000003s)]
*  And they rode in that manner into the night. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3193.4s)]
*  Shortly before dawn, the barge ran aground. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3196.92s)]
*  Norwegian prisoners on George Schwab's barge took advantage of the wind blowing toward [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3200.84s)]
*  shore. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3205.96s)]
*  They came and collected the blankets that we had and made sails, and we managed to sail [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3207.28s)]
*  towards land. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3216.0s)]
*  After death, but desperate to live, Schwab and the Goldbergs found the strength to climb [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3218.6s)]
*  out of their barges, only to be intercepted by the SS and German troops on the beach, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3223.48s)]
*  who shot and killed many prisoners on the spot. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3229.24s)]
*  And we felt practically certain that we would be shot next, but instead they lined us up [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3233.2799999999997s)]
*  into a column. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3240.08s)]
*  We were told that we were going to be shipped to a liner by the name of Cap Arcona. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3241.2799999999997s)]
*  And while we stood there, we saw quite a large number of bombers, airplanes, moving overhead. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3252.2s)]
*  The Cap Arcona was in the bomber's sights. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3260.7999999999997s)]
*  The war was nearly over, but the prisoner's ordeal was not. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3263.72s)]
*  Part of the story when we come back. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3268.64s)]
*  At the beginning of May 1945, the war in Europe was all but over. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3282.64s)]
*  Adolf Hitler was dead, German forces were in retreat, and the Third Reich was crumbling. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3288.04s)]
*  One of the last Nazi defensive positions was at Lubik Bay in the Baltic Sea, where [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3294.68s)]
*  German ships fled seeking safe harbor, including the Cap Arcona, a luxury ocean liner commandeered [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3299.7599999999998s)]
*  by the Nazis for the war effort. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3307.04s)]
*  As the Allies closed in, the SS evacuated concentration camps and packed thousands of [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3309.68s)]
*  prisoners onto the Cap Arcona. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3316.0s)]
*  Around noon on May 3, 1945, 13-year-old George Schwab was ordered to line up to board the ship. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3318.48s)]
*  But the Cap Arcona could not come close to shore because it was a large, big ship. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3326.88s)]
*  So we were going to be transported to the Cap Arcona by an other ship. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3333.08s)]
*  I was in the back of the line. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3338.88s)]
*  I was in no hurry. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3340.28s)]
*  You purposely got to the back of the line? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3341.68s)]
*  The back of the line. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3343.48s)]
*  He was at a dock near this German naval base, where Manfred Goldberg and his mother were [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3345.08s)]
*  lined up too. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3350.28s)]
*  And it is while we stood there that we witnessed bombers and fighter planes coming along. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3352.08s)]
*  Could you see any markings on the plane? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3359.08s)]
*  No, we had no idea what nationality they were. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3361.08s)]
*  You could see the planes coming in. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3363.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, we could see the planes, clearly. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3365.28s)]
*  We could see the bombs dropping. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3366.48s)]
*  Can you remember what it sounded like? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3368.48s)]
*  There was something like a bomb. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3370.88s)]
*  I can't remember what it sounded like. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3372.48s)]
*  There were some pretty powerful explosions and there were quite a few. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3374.68s)]
*  The Cap Arcona was hit. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3378.88s)]
*  With more than 4,000 prisoners on board, the floating concentration camp became a fiery [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3381.38s)]
*  tomb. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3387.28s)]
*  In a hard-to-believe turn of events, the attackers were British typhoon fighters like these, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3388.28s)]
*  part of the Allied forces moving in to finish off the Nazis. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3394.88s)]
*  The British came to liberate these prisoners and ended up killing thousands of them. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3399.28s)]
*  It's like horror on top of horror. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3406.48s)]
*  It is, and yet some of them did survive to remember it. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3408.88s)]
*  Bill Niven is a British historian and scholar of the Holocaust. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3413.88s)]
*  He told us the mistaken attack on the Cap Arcona and a smaller ship is one of the most [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3418.0800000000004s)]
*  wrenching tragedies of the war. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3423.48s)]
*  The prisoners knew that the war was nearing its end. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3425.98s)]
*  I think a lot of them probably had hopes that they would survive and that gave them the [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3429.78s)]
*  strength and the courage to hang on. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3433.98s)]
*  At the Cap Arcona Museum in the town of Neustadt by Lubik Bay, he described the attack. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3435.78s)]
*  British typhoons struck in waves. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3443.18s)]
*  The Cap Arcona was hit around 3 p.m. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3445.58s)]
*  If you have any idea how many bombs were dropped on the ship, some people say 60 or over 60. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3448.58s)]
*  You can imagine the panic and the horror that broke out when the bombs hit the ship, especially [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3454.38s)]
*  for those concentration camp prisoners. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3458.78s)]
*  We were in the very lower decks of the ship and they were unable to get up to the top [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3460.38s)]
*  because of the flames. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3464.6800000000003s)]
*  Is this the worst case of friendly fire in the Royal Air Force's history? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3466.6800000000003s)]
*  Quite probably, yeah. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3472.6800000000003s)]
*  Sebastian Cox is chief historian for Britain's Royal Air Force, the RAF. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3475.38s)]
*  He blames the incident on the fog of war. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3480.78s)]
*  Why was the Cap Arcona targeted? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3484.18s)]
*  Because the Allies believed that there was going to be an attempt to flee by certain [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3487.7799999999997s)]
*  Nazi elements across the Baltic to Norway and essentially continue the war. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3495.2799999999997s)]
*  Did the British military have any idea that concentration camp survivors were on the Cap Arcona? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3501.58s)]
*  If you mean did the pilots have any idea, absolutely not. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3508.58s)]
*  But other members of the British military did know. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3512.78s)]
*  What we learned from the records that the British were handed two opportunities very [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3516.38s)]
*  close to the 3rd of May in regards to the placement of prisoners on board the ship. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3521.78s)]
*  Concentration camp prisoners on those ships. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3527.38s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3530.38s)]
*  Daniel Long wrote his PhD history thesis on the attack on the Cap Arcona. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3531.38s)]
*  We met him at the British National Archives in London where he showed us these fragile [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3536.98s)]
*  war documents. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3542.08s)]
*  This is the only official investigation that was carried out into the tragic sinking of [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3543.98s)]
*  the Cap Arcona. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3549.2799999999997s)]
*  Shortly after the bombing, a British war crimes investigator interviewed the intelligence [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3550.7799999999997s)]
*  officer for the squadrons that attacked the Cap Arcona and other ships in the bay. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3555.68s)]
*  The intelligence officer admitted on two occasions that a message was received on the 2nd of May, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3561.08s)]
*  1945, that the ships had been loaded with concentration camp prisoners. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3566.68s)]
*  That intelligence came in the day before the attack. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3571.78s)]
*  Which then leads to suggest that there was ample time to warn the pilots on the planes. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3575.98s)]
*  That information did not make it to the RAF pilots? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3580.38s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3583.98s)]
*  The report does not say why the intelligence officer failed to inform the pilots, but it [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3585.28s)]
*  did blame RAF personnel for the error and called for further inquiry. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3590.6800000000003s)]
*  The report strongly urged that there be a follow-up investigation. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3596.78s)]
*  That has never happened, has it? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3602.78s)]
*  Not to my knowledge. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3604.5800000000004s)]
*  Why not? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3605.5800000000004s)]
*  Attempting to, you know, conduct a detailed investigation would in many respects be a [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3607.1800000000003s)]
*  little pointless. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3614.48s)]
*  What are you going to conclude? [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3615.48s)]
*  To find out what went wrong, what mistakes were made. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3616.98s)]
*  We know what happened. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3621.02s)]
*  The RAF made a mistake. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3623.32s)]
*  An individual made a very tragic mistake and we know the consequences. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3625.94s)]
*  About 7,000 prisoners perished when the ships were bombed in the bay. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3631.78s)]
*  Of the more than 4,000 on the Cap Arcona, only about 400 survived. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3636.86s)]
*  Bill Niven told us several survivors later wrote accounts of the hell they endured at [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3644.2200000000003s)]
*  sea. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3649.46s)]
*  Thousands of prisoners were packed together like herrings. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3650.46s)]
*  They stretched their arms up and screamed, I want out, I want out. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3656.46s)]
*  They stretched their arms up and they cried out, I want out, I want out. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3661.06s)]
*  This is really quite terrible to have to read this. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3665.5s)]
*  The fire suddenly got more and more intensive and this was because the flesh of the prisoners [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3667.5s)]
*  was burning so strongly it made this intensity happen. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3672.46s)]
*  It's distressing to read. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3676.5s)]
*  Bruno Neurath Wilson's father, Willy, a political prisoner, was trapped on the ship when the [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3679.14s)]
*  bombs hit. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3685.02s)]
*  My father managed to go to the back of the ship where it was not burning and there he [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3686.5s)]
*  survived because he couldn't swim. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3691.2599999999998s)]
*  He survived because he couldn't swim? [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3693.98s)]
*  He couldn't swim because he did not jump into the water and prisoners who jumped into [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3695.46s)]
*  the water were shot by the SS. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3699.9s)]
*  When the British realized their mistake, they dispatched rescuers who plucked Willy Neurath [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3702.66s)]
*  and others from the listing deck of the Caparcona and took them to shore. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3708.22s)]
*  This is the stretch of beach where your father came ashore? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3713.98s)]
*  This front of the beach, yes. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3717.62s)]
*  Bruno told us in an improbable twist of fate his mother Ava, a naval staff assistant, had [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3719.8599999999997s)]
*  been transferred to the naval base at Lubik Bay. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3725.7799999999997s)]
*  When she saw the bombing, she was drawn to the beach. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3729.4199999999996s)]
*  She had only one hope, to know where is my husband? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3733.4199999999996s)]
*  Is he still living? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3737.46s)]
*  And maybe my husband is on the ship. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3738.56s)]
*  How did they find each other? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3741.1600000000003s)]
*  She came from this direction and she saw a man coming towards her. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3743.04s)]
*  She didn't recognize the one person she wanted to see. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3746.88s)]
*  He must have been thin and weak. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3751.28s)]
*  And dirty from the burning. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3754.2000000000003s)]
*  But he came over to her and called his nickname he had for her Muppel. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3756.92s)]
*  What does Muppel mean? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3763.3s)]
*  It means something like I love your round face. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3764.3s)]
*  She recognized his voice by this one word Muppel. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3768.26s)]
*  That ship was a graveyard for so many people. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3772.26s)]
*  But yet it brought your parents back together. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3776.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3778.94s)]
*  I don't know if there are hidden meanings in life. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3779.94s)]
*  But one meaning can be that I am alive now and can tell you about the story. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3784.02s)]
*  As for George Schwab, he pulled inspiration from the horror. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3790.82s)]
*  This is a prize for having helped Latvia get into NATO. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3795.38s)]
*  The native of Latvia moved to New York, earned a PhD in political science and had an illustrious [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3799.7000000000003s)]

*  Somewhat. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3816.94s)]
*  Manfred Goldberg and his mother settled in London. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3819.94s)]
*  She passed away in 1961. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3823.34s)]
*  Goldberg married, started a business and a family. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3826.18s)]
*  In 2017, he returned to the Stutthof concentration camp with the then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3829.9s)]
*  He has made it his life mission to share his story. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3837.34s)]
*  I consider that part of my revenge on the Nazis. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3841.3s)]
*  They wanted to exterminate us and here we are, not only having survived, we are now [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3844.9s)]
*  great-grandparents. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3851.9s)]
*  That's your revenge. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvcc9JnGodg&t=3852.9s)]
