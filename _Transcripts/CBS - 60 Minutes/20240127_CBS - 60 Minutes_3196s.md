**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [January 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4)
*  In what year will the human population grow too large for the Earth to sustain? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=0.0s)]
*  The answer is about 1970, according to research by the World Wildlife Fund. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=19.6s)]
*  In 1970, the planet's three and a half billion people were sustainable. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=26.48s)]
*  But on this New Year's Day, the population is eight billion. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=31.68s)]
*  Today, wild plants and animals are running out of places to live. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=36.56s)]
*  The scientists you're about to meet say the Earth is suffering a crisis of mass extinction [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=42.08s)]
*  on a scale unseen since the dinosaurs. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=48.28s)]
*  We're going to show you a possible solution, but first have a look at how humanity is already [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=51.72s)]
*  suffering from the vanishing wild. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=57.6s)]
*  In Washington state, the Salish Sea helped feed the world. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=63.2s)]
*  With this weather and the way things feel once I get out here, it's time to be fishing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=69.36s)]
*  That's what it feels like. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=74.56s)]
*  Commercial fisherman Dana Wilson supported a family on the Salish Sea's legendary wealth [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=75.56s)]
*  of salmon. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  He remembers propellers churning the water off Blaine, Washington, and cranes straining [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=83.4s)]
*  for the state's $200 million annual catch. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=89.4s)]
*  That used to be a buying station. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  They're gone now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=95.84s)]
*  They don't buy anymore. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=96.84s)]
*  So that building over there used to buy salmon. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=98.2s)]
*  They don't buy salmon anymore. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=101.64s)]
*  It's just not here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=103.96s)]
*  In 1991, one salmon species was endangered. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=106.52s)]
*  Today, 14 salmon populations are foundering. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  They've been crowded out of rivers by habitat destruction, warming, and pollution. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  Dana Wilson used to fish all summer. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=121.24s)]
*  Today, a conservation authority grants rare, fleeting permission to throw a net. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=123.96s)]
*  There was a season. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=130.88s)]
*  There was a season. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=131.88s)]
*  Now there's a day. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=132.88s)]
*  Sometimes it's hours. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  Sometimes you might get 12 hours, 16 hours. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  That's what we're down to. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=139.84s)]
*  Here, the vanishing wilds scuttled a way of life that began with native tribes a thousand [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=141.84s)]
*  years ago. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=148.56s)]
*  I don't remember anybody doing anything other than salmon fishing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=150.0s)]
*  Fisherman Armando Briones is a member of the Lummi tribe, which calls itself People of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=153.64s)]
*  the Salmon. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=159.44s)]
*  He didn't imagine the rich harvest would end with his five fishing boats. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=160.8s)]
*  All of a sudden you're trying to figure out, well, how am I going to make that paycheck [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  for my family? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=168.52s)]
*  Well, for me, it was like, well, I have a backup for a backup for a backup for a backup. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=169.52s)]
*  Briones' backups include his new food truck, switching to crab fishing, and consulting [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=173.72s)]
*  on cannabis farms. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=179.72000000000003s)]
*  His scramble to adapt is being repeated around the world. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=182.08s)]
*  A World Wildlife Fund study says that in the past 50 years, the abundance of global wildlife [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=187.64s)]
*  has collapsed 69 percent, mostly for the same reason. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  Too many people, too much consumption, and growth mania. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=199.92s)]
*  At the age of 90, biologist Paul Ehrlich may have lived long enough to see some of his [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=204.78s)]
*  dire prophecies come true. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=210.34s)]
*  You seem to be saying that humanity is not sustainable. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=212.64s)]
*  Humanity is not sustainable. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=215.72s)]
*  To maintain our lifestyle, yours and mine basically, for the entire planet, you'd need [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=217.56s)]
*  five more Earths, not clear where they're going to come from. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=223.68s)]
*  Just in terms of the resources that would be required. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  Resources that would be required, the systems that support our lives, which of course are [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=230.36s)]
*  the biodiversity that we're wiping out. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=236.28s)]
*  Humanity is very busily sitting on a limb that we're sawing off. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=240.24s)]
*  In 1968, Ehrlich, a biology professor at Stanford, became a doomsday celebrity with a bestseller [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=245.44s)]
*  forecasting the collapse of nature. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=253.36s)]
*  When the population bomb came out, you were described as an alarmist. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=256.1s)]
*  I was alarmed. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  I am still alarmed. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=261.44s)]
*  All of my colleagues are alarmed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=263.12s)]
*  The alarm Ehrlich sounded in 68 warned that overpopulation would trigger widespread famine. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=265.64s)]
*  He was wrong about that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=272.91999999999996s)]
*  The Green Revolution fed the world. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=274.64s)]
*  But he also wrote in 68 that heat from greenhouse gases would melt polar ice and humanity would [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  overwhelm the wild. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  Today, humans have taken over 70 percent of the planet's land and 70 percent of the fresh [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=287.0s)]
*  water. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=294.28s)]
*  The rate of extinction is extraordinarily high now and getting higher all the time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  We know the rate of extinction is extraordinarily high because of a study of the fossil record [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=301.84s)]
*  by biologist Tony Barnofsky, Ehrlich's Stanford colleague. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=307.47999999999996s)]
*  The data are rock solid. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't think you'll find a scientist that will say we're not in an extinction crisis. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=313.67999999999995s)]
*  Barnofsky's research suggests today's rate of extinction is up to 100 times faster than [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  is typical in the nearly four billion year history of life. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=324.6s)]
*  These peaks represent the few times that life collapsed globally and the last was the dinosaurs [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=329.56s)]
*  66 million years ago. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=336.32000000000005s)]
*  There are five times in Earth's history where we had mass extinctions and by mass extinctions [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean at least 75 percent, three quarters of the known species disappearing from the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=345.72s)]
*  face of the Earth. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=353.32s)]
*  Now we're witnessing what a lot of people are calling the sixth mass extinction where [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=355.0s)]
*  the same thing could happen on our watch. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=361.32s)]
*  It's a horrific state of the planet when common species, the ubiquitous species that we're [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=364.35999999999996s)]
*  familiar with are declining. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=370.79999999999995s)]
*  Tony Barnofsky's colleague in the study of extinction is his wife, biologist Liz Hadley, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=373.08s)]
*  faculty director at Stanford's Jasper Ridge Research Preserve in California. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=379.52s)]
*  You know I see it in my mind and it's a really sad state. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=385.12s)]
*  If you spend any time in California you know the loss of water. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=388.76s)]
*  The loss of water means that there are dead salmon you see in the river right before your [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=393.0s)]
*  eyes but it also means the demise of those birds that rely on the salmon fishery, eagles. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=397.84s)]
*  It means things like minks and otters that rely on fish. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=405.08s)]
*  It means that our habitats that we're used to, the forests that, you know, 3,000 year [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=409.56s)]
*  old forests are going to be gone. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=414.0s)]
*  So it means silence and it means some very catastrophic events because it's happening [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=416.97999999999996s)]
*  so quickly. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=423.24s)]
*  It means you look out your window and three quarters of what you think ought to be there [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=424.24s)]
*  is no longer there. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=429.53999999999996s)]
*  That's what mass extinction looks like. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=432.32s)]
*  What we see just in California is, you know, the loss of our iconic state symbols. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=434.48s)]
*  We have no more grizzly bears in California. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=440.52000000000004s)]
*  The only grizzly bears in California are on the state flag? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=442.76s)]
*  That's our state mammal and they're not here anymore. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  Is it too much to say that we're killing the planet? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=451.3s)]
*  No. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  I would say it's too much to say that we're killing the planet because the planet's going [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=455.56s)]
*  to be fine. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=460.82s)]
*  What we're doing is we're killing our way of life. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=462.2s)]
*  The worst of the killing is in Latin America where the World Wildlife Fund study says the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=465.46s)]
*  abundance of wildlife has fallen 94% since 1970. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=471.92s)]
*  But it was also in Latin America that we found the possibility of hope. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=478.76s)]
*  Mexican ecologist Gerardo Sevalios is one of the world's leading scientists on extinction. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  He told us the only solution is to save the one-third of the earth that remains wild. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=491.82s)]
*  To prove it, he's running a 3,000 square mile experiment in the Colicmo Biosphere Reserve [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=499.14s)]
*  near Guatemala. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=505.94s)]
*  He is paying family farmers to stop cutting the forest. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=507.36s)]
*  We're going to pay each family a certain amount of money that is more than you will get cutting [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=512.22s)]
*  down the forest if you protect it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=517.98s)]
*  How much are you paying out every year? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=521.38s)]
*  For instance, each family here will get around $1,000. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=523.38s)]
*  More than enough here to make up for lost farmland. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=529.64s)]
*  In total, the payouts come to $1.5 million a year or about $2,000 per square mile. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=533.64s)]
*  The TAB is paid through the charity of wealthy donors. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=541.6600000000001s)]
*  The investment to protect what is left is really small. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=545.86s)]
*  The payoff on that investment is being collected on Sevalios' jungle cameras. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=552.28s)]
*  Thirty years ago, the jaguar was very nearly extinct in Mexico. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=557.62s)]
*  Now Sevalios says they've rebounded to about 600 in the reserve. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=563.1800000000001s)]
*  There are other places where there are reserves around the world where they've been able to [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=568.54s)]
*  increase the populations of certain species. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=572.9s)]
*  But I wonder, are all these little success stories enough to prevent mass extinction? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=576.5s)]
*  All the big success that we have in protecting forests and recovering animals like tigers [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=585.5799999999999s)]
*  in India, jaguars in Mexico, elephants in Botswana and so on are incredible, amazing [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=592.14s)]
*  successes. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=598.24s)]
*  There are grains of sand in a beach. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=599.62s)]
*  To really make a big impact, we need to scale up this 10,000 times. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=603.98s)]
*  So they are important because they give us hope, but they are completely insufficient [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=610.22s)]
*  to cope with climate change. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=616.1s)]
*  So what would the world have to do? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=617.54s)]
*  What we would have to do is to really understand that the climate change and species extinction [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=620.26s)]
*  is a threat to humanity and then put all the machinery of society, political, economic [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=625.94s)]
*  and social, towards finding solutions to the problems. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=635.1800000000001s)]
*  Finding solutions to the problems was the goal two weeks ago at the UN Biodiversity [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=641.22s)]
*  Conference where nations agreed to conservation targets. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=646.94s)]
*  But at the same meeting in 2010, those nations agreed to limit the destruction of the earth [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=651.66s)]
*  by 2020 and not one of those goals was met. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=657.5799999999999s)]
*  This despite thousands of studies, including the continuing research of Stanford biologist [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=662.5799999999999s)]
*  Paul Ehrlich. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=669.1s)]
*  You know that there is no political will to do any of the things that you're recommending. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=670.42s)]
*  I know there's no political will to do any of the things that I'm concerned with, which [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=677.62s)]
*  is exactly why I and the vast majority of my colleagues think we've had it, that the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=683.26s)]
*  next few decades will be the end of the kind of civilization we're used to. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=690.9000000000001s)]
*  In the 50 years since Ehrlich's population bomb, humanity's feasting on resources has [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=696.7s)]
*  tripled. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=702.7s)]
*  We're already consuming 175% of what the earth can regenerate. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=704.02s)]
*  And consider, half of humanity, about 4 billion, live on less than $10 a day. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=710.14s)]
*  They aspire to cars, air conditioning and a rich diet. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=717.02s)]
*  But they won't be fed by the fishermen of Washington's Salish Sea, including Armando [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=722.14s)]
*  Briones. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=728.18s)]
*  The tribe has been fishing salmon here for hundreds of years. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=729.46s)]
*  And your generation is seeing the end of that. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=733.74s)]
*  It's getting harder and harder. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=736.9s)]
*  I hate to say it, I don't want to say it's the end of it. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=739.82s)]
*  Why do you feel so emotionally attached to this? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=745.74s)]
*  It's everything we know. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=750.02s)]
*  I'm fortunate enough to know where I know a lot of different things. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=755.94s)]
*  I've done a lot of different things in my life. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=758.5s)]
*  I've gotten good at evolving and changing. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=764.62s)]
*  But not everybody here is built like that. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=770.26s)]
*  And to some of us, this is what they know. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=772.86s)]
*  This is all they know. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=775.94s)]
*  The five mass extinctions of the ancient past were caused by natural calamities, volcanoes [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=778.66s)]
*  and an asteroid. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=785.5s)]
*  Today, if the science is right, humanity may have to survive a sixth mass extinction in [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=787.82s)]
*  a world of its own making. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=795.0600000000001s)]
*  The United States has national parks devoted to canyons and deserts, glaciers and geysers, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=813.42s)]
*  even underwater coral reefs, 63 national parks in all. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=819.42s)]
*  But somehow, we skipped the American prairie. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=823.86s)]
*  The grasslands that once stretched from the Mississippi River to the Rockies played a [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=827.1s)]
*  vital role in the lives of Native Americans, white settlers, and an endless variety of [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=831.26s)]
*  wildlife. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=837.3s)]
*  They inspired explorers and artists, but apparently not park planners. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=838.4599999999999s)]
*  Nearly 20 years ago, a nonprofit organization began trying to fix that, not with a new national [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=843.62s)]
*  park, but rather a huge privately operated nature reserve on the Great Plains, one that [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=850.2199999999999s)]
*  would be open to the public, but also a place where buffalo can roam once again. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=856.26s)]
*  Through a vast stretch of open and for the moment empty grassland, Allison Fox is taking [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=865.14s)]
*  us up a muddy two-track path in search of buffalo. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=871.82s)]
*  This road is incredible. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=876.22s)]
*  Fox is the CEO of American Prairie, which has, as just one of many audacious goals, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=880.74s)]
*  the restoration of bison to a landscape they once ruled. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=887.3000000000001s)]
*  Oh, there, there. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=891.5400000000001s)]
*  Oh, there they are. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=893.34s)]
*  Look at them. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=894.4200000000001s)]
*  Wow, there they are. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=895.4200000000001s)]
*  Oh, look at the babies. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=896.4200000000001s)]
*  Look at them. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=897.4200000000001s)]
*  We found part of what American Prairie calls its conservation herd of about 800 buffalo. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=900.9s)]
*  This group is mainly mothers with new calves, which are a distinctive shade of red. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=908.34s)]
*  Trying to account of the babies, but now they've kind of moved the babies into the middle of [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=913.5s)]
*  the group. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=917.62s)]
*  This land is like this as far as the eye can see. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=919.62s)]
*  That's not a bad description of the scale of American Prairie's ambition, to create [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=922.9s)]
*  the largest nature reserve in the contiguous United States. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=927.9s)]
*  The nonprofit has more than 50 employees, from fundraisers to buffalo rankers. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=931.9s)]
*  Allison Fox has worked there for 15 years and has been in charge for the last four. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=937.9s)]
*  Overall, the goal is to have how many acres in this reserve? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=944.9s)]
*  Yeah, the overall goal is about 5,000 square miles, 3.2 million acres of intact grasslands, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=949.18s)]
*  comparable to the size of the state of Connecticut and also comparable to Glacier and Yellowstone [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=956.18s)]
*  National Parks combined. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=962.18s)]
*  That's big. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=963.18s)]
*  It is big. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=964.18s)]
*  The big chunk of land is mostly north of the Missouri River in north central Montana, one [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=966.18s)]
*  of the most remote parts of the country. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=972.18s)]
*  It's a patchwork of privately owned cattle ranches and land owned by the government, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=975.4599999999999s)]
*  including a huge existing national wildlife refuge named after the famous cowboy painter, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=980.4599999999999s)]
*  Charles M. Russell. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=987.4599999999999s)]
*  And that 1.1 million acres serves as the anchor of American Prairie's 3.2 million acre vision. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=989.4599999999999s)]
*  And so you've got these big chunks of federal land and you're buying land from the state [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=998.4599999999999s)]
*  and you're buying land in between to try to piece it all together. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1003.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1007.74s)]
*  So, just about every time a private ranch comes up for sale inside its desired footprint, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1008.74s)]
*  American Prairie tries to buy it to add another piece to its puzzle and preserve more grassland. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1015.74s)]
*  How many ranches have you purchased? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1022.74s)]
*  We have purchased 34 ranches. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1024.74s)]
*  To buy all those ranches, American Prairie has raised nearly $200 million for more than [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1028.02s)]
*  4,000 donors, including Wall Street financiers and technology moguls. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1035.02s)]
*  It says it will take hundreds of millions more and decades more to complete the patchwork. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1040.02s)]
*  So this is a long game. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1047.02s)]
*  This is a long game and it's a long game for land acquisition. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1048.02s)]
*  It's a probably even longer game for the restoration of habitats and species. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1052.02s)]
*  This area was America's Serengeti, truly America's Serengeti with tens of thousands of bison, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1057.3s)]
*  pronghorn, elk, deer, grizzly bears, wolves. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1064.3s)]
*  Is that the goal or is that a goal to restore that? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1069.3s)]
*  Yes, to have the ecosystem function fully as it once did. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1075.3s)]
*  Charles Russell's paintings portray a romanticized version of what the prairie ecosystem used [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1080.3s)]
*  to look like, teeming herds of buffalo, Native Americans hunting and living alongside the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1086.78s)]
*  buffalo, at least until they both were displaced by white settlers and hundreds of thousands [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1093.78s)]
*  of cattle. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1099.6599999999999s)]
*  It's amazing to think of the people that lived here before us, people and other things. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1101.22s)]
*  So over this direction, there's quite a cluster of tepee rings so the Native Americans used [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1104.3799999999999s)]
*  to use this. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1108.78s)]
*  Connie French operates this cattle ranch with her husband Craig and they are proud of their [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1112.26s)]
*  collaboration with conservation groups. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1117.26s)]
*  In fact, they graze some of their cattle on a ranch that's been owned by the Nature Conservancy [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1120.1s)]
*  for more than 20 years. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1125.5s)]
*  But when American Prairie's early leaders came in talking about saving the land, it [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1128.62s)]
*  really rubbed her wrong. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1134.8999999999999s)]
*  So saving it, yes, but not just tromping over people. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1138.3799999999999s)]
*  Is that what it feels like? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1141.3799999999999s)]
*  It does feel like that sometimes, yes. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1142.78s)]
*  They came in like, we know better. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1144.3799999999999s)]
*  You have said that for their vision to become a reality, you and what you do, that you're [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1148.1s)]
*  gone. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1157.1s)]
*  I guess I can say yes, that's how it feels to us, to me. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1158.1s)]
*  Along the few roads slicing through the grasslands here, the signs are everywhere. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1165.3400000000001s)]
*  Save the cowboy. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1170.3400000000001s)]
*  Stop American Prairie Reserve. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1171.98s)]
*  They make it clear that a lot of Connie French's ranching neighbors share her concern. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1174.3s)]
*  What some ranchers have told us is that when you say you want to save the land, what they [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1180.46s)]
*  hear is that you want to save the land from them. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1188.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, we are well aware that that word save hit a nerve and that was not at all our [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1191.46s)]
*  intention. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1196.8600000000001s)]
*  Many of our ranching neighbors are committed to conservation, so if I could pull back that [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1198.02s)]
*  word save, I absolutely would. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1202.3s)]
*  American Prairie is now working hard to mend fences with skeptical neighbors. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1204.58s)]
*  It has a program called Wild Sky, run by a wildlife biologist on its staff, Daniel Kinka. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1210.18s)]
*  Wild Sky ranchers are the best at what they do in terms of sustainable ranching. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1217.98s)]
*  Wild Sky will pay a rancher up to $15,000 a year for things like modifying fences to [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1223.8600000000001s)]
*  make them easier for wildlife to get over or through while still keeping cattle contained. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1230.58s)]
*  It also pays ranchers to install cameras on their property. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1237.42s)]
*  The rancher gets paid for every animal that crosses the path of this camera? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1241.64s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1245.8600000000001s)]
*  A coyote, that's 25 bucks. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1246.86s)]
*  A black bear comes behind it, that's 300 bucks. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1248.34s)]
*  Four or five elk come behind it, that's 50 bucks. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1250.8999999999999s)]
*  The biggest payouts are for wolves and grizzly bears, $500 per picture, per camera, per day. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1253.3s)]
*  Wolves and grizzly bears aren't on this part of the prairie at the moment. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1259.4799999999998s)]
*  The idea of Wild Sky is that as they and other wildlife do return, payments will help cattle [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1263.34s)]
*  ranchers tolerate them. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1270.1399999999999s)]
*  Make sure you follow up the calves. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1272.6s)]
*  Lance Johnson, a fourth generation Montanen who runs a cattle ranch with his wife and [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1274.94s)]
*  two daughters, is one of 15 Wild Sky ranchers. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1280.06s)]
*  The cameras on his property have captured enough pictures this year to earn him $6,000, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1284.8200000000002s)]
*  the annual maximum American Prairie will pay for photos of wildlife. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1291.3s)]
*  These ranches are so hard to make profitable that if you can figure out any way to supplement [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1296.3400000000001s)]
*  then that's probably necessary right now. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1302.3s)]
*  Johnson also leases grass and grazes cattle on a ranch owned by American Prairie. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1305.26s)]
*  So while some of his neighbors see it as a threat, he says that working with it helps [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1311.3s)]
*  ensure his family's future. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1316.9199999999998s)]
*  You see a place for you and your daughters and your cattle on this land for the foreseeable [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1319.74s)]
*  future. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1325.62s)]
*  We hope so. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1326.62s)]
*  We hope for the rest of our lives that we're there. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1327.62s)]
*  I want to do everything I can to give our girls that opportunity to have ranching in [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1329.5s)]
*  the future. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1332.94s)]
*  American Prairie says it intends to work alongside cattle ranchers for decades to come and it [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1334.94s)]
*  does have some natural allies in the neighborhood. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1340.9s)]
*  The rancher and the wild space, can those two coexist? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1344.54s)]
*  Yeah, they can and they are. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1348.54s)]
*  Happening right now. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1352.14s)]
*  Mark Asher was born and raised on the Fort Belknap Reservation, which is adjacent to [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1353.54s)]
*  where American Prairie is assembling its reserve. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1358.78s)]
*  He's a former president of the Reservations Tribal Council, made up of members of two [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1362.34s)]
*  tribes, the Nakota and the Ani. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1367.3s)]
*  Is there any recollection of what this land was like before the white settlers came? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1371.22s)]
*  Like the wildlife? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1378.22s)]
*  Yes, it was plentiful. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1380.22s)]
*  Millions and millions of buffalo and antelope and deer and prairie dogs, black-footed ferrets, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1383.06s)]
*  elk. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1390.06s)]
*  The tribes at Fort Belknap began building their bison herd nearly a half century ago [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1392.3799999999999s)]
*  and it's now more than a thousand animals. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1397.78s)]
*  Mark Asher took us out to see part of the herd, which roams across a huge pasture on [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1401.1s)]
*  the reservation. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1407.3799999999999s)]
*  So they're just scattered out doing what buffalo do and that's eat the grass and right now [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1409.02s)]
*  enjoy the weather. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1415.74s)]
*  The tribes benefit economically from selling some buffalo meat. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1417.06s)]
*  But you can see in the symbols used during native ceremonies that their value is much [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1422.9s)]
*  greater than money. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1428.54s)]
*  We know the history of the tribes and the buffalo and they were one in the same to come [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1430.3s)]
*  out here and get on the prairie and see a herd of buffalo. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1436.84s)]
*  You can kind of leave that world for a little bit and reconnect with that lifestyle that [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1443.04s)]
*  my ancestors lived years ago. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1450.6s)]
*  Might be just a little bit, but it's there. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1454.1599999999999s)]
*  Some ranchers fear that the tribes and American prairie will let their buffalo roam free [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1457.84s)]
*  as they once did. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1463.56s)]
*  We use the term free and I always argued that point because there's a fence somewhere. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1465.42s)]
*  There has to be a fence somewhere. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1473.38s)]
*  But as much room as we can give them to roam, then within that context they'll be free. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1475.46s)]
*  But not like it was 200 years ago and we understand that. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1482.72s)]
*  Still be a place where you can come and see the buffalo roam. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1487.3000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1490.42s)]
*  American prairie encourages people to visit the land it owns. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1492.26s)]
*  It operates campgrounds and has built huts and yurts that anyone can reserve. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1496.26s)]
*  It allows hunting on many properties, which helps to build support among Montanans. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1501.34s)]
*  Across the west you see more and more no trespassing signs. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1507.5s)]
*  We've talked a lot about wildlife and wildlife habitat, but certainly providing access for [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1511.78s)]
*  people to appreciate, learn from, recreate on this land is a really important part of [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1517.08s)]
*  what we're doing as well. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1524.28s)]
*  The debate over American prairie is often framed as an either or. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1526.1999999999998s)]
*  Either there are cattle or buffalo. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1531.52s)]
*  If preservationists win, ranchers lose. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1534.0s)]
*  What we found across these wide expanses of grass were much more subtle shades of green. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1537.58s)]
*  You know when a new group comes in, new folks, new neighbors, it takes some time to learn [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1544.58s)]
*  if it's legit. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1551.62s)]
*  What I think I hear you saying is they have to earn your trust and so far they have not. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1553.12s)]
*  No. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1559.58s)]
*  That trust isn't given lightly. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1560.58s)]
*  With the size of the state of Montana and the herds of cattle, hundreds of thousands [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1563.34s)]
*  of animals in this state, I don't think buffalo will ever compete and that's not what we're [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1569.02s)]
*  trying to do. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1575.42s)]
*  With American prairie, take a section of land in the state and return it back as best we [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1577.42s)]
*  can to what it was 200 years ago. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1584.9s)]
*  It's a huge section of land. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1587.98s)]
*  Still not bigger than Montana. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1590.74s)]
*  I think there's room here for both. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1592.78s)]
*  Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park was the envy of Africa. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1599.0s)]
*  Wildlife drew tourists from around the world. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1613.86s)]
*  But beginning in the 1960s, a man-made catastrophe slaughtered the animals until it was said [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1616.78s)]
*  there was nothing left but mosquitoes and landmines. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1623.78s)]
*  In 2008, we followed an American entrepreneur who dreamed of returning a wasteland to greatness. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1627.66s)]
*  Now, 14 years later, Greg Carr has something to show the world and we couldn't resist a [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1635.66s)]
*  return to Gorongosa when Carr sends invitations like this. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1642.1200000000001s)]
*  Just come and sit at a sunset by the lake in the center of this national park and you [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1650.3600000000001s)]
*  know, time stops. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1657.98s)]
*  And you get a hundred colors of yellow and a hundred colors of orange and then the desk [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1662.28s)]
*  sets in. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1667.72s)]
*  And then a flock of birds go over the water and there's a hippo over there making a noise. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1670.0800000000002s)]
*  And there's an impel over there. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1675.0800000000002s)]
*  And you know, it's like, well, I could have been here 100,000 years ago and it might have [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1678.8200000000002s)]
*  been the same. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1683.8200000000002s)]
*  Greg Carr's wonder is almost like disbelief. A million acres of Africa reborn. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1686.98s)]
*  When I first came here in 2004, I could drive around with my Mozambican friends all day [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1694.8999999999999s)]
*  long. And if we were lucky, maybe we'd see one baboon or one warthog or something. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1701.1399999999999s)]
*  Now we drive around and it's an ocean of wildlife. Come around the corner, there's a herd of [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1707.1799999999998s)]
*  elephants, you know, go the other direction. There's some lion cubs. 10,000 waterbuck. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1714.18s)]
*  And I say to myself, you know what? Nature can rebound. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1720.38s)]
*  The rebound is in southeast Africa, near the center of Mozambique. Here, 28 years of war [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1724.26s)]
*  from the 60s to the 90s killed an estimated one million people and wiped out 95 percent [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1731.78s)]
*  of the wildlife in Gorongosa for food and profit. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1738.8999999999999s)]
*  As the war raged in the 1980s, Greg Carr was a tech entrepreneur who'd made a fortune [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1743.02s)]
*  perfecting voicemail. He quit business to devote himself to human rights. And in 2004, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1749.1399999999999s)]
*  he met Mozambique's president, Joaquin Chisano, who made a wild pitch. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1757.34s)]
*  And he said, look, please come to Mozambique and help us. And we want to restore our national [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1763.3999999999999s)]
*  park. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1768.14s)]
*  When we flew over this, I said, this is it. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1768.74s)]
*  When we met Carr in 2008, his nonprofit foundation had signed a 20-year contract with Mozambique. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1773.06s)]
*  His plan was to import animals from all over Africa. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1780.86s)]
*  Well, step one, we had to remove 20,000 traps and wire snares that were left in this park, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1786.46s)]
*  left over from the war. Get rid of all those, because when I first came here, I mean, we [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1794.46s)]
*  think we had five or six lions, maybe. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1800.46s)]
*  In a million acres. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1802.46s)]
*  In a million acres. And the lions that we did have, most of them had three legs because [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1803.46s)]
*  they had stepped in a trap or something. And then second, some of the species were just [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1808.46s)]
*  gone completely. So we went on a process. First, bring in the herbivores. So we bring [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1813.46s)]
*  in 200 buffalo. We bring in 200 wildebeest. We bring in some zebra. And then when you [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1819.46s)]
*  got enough herbivores, then you're going to want the carnivores back. So we reintroduced [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1824.46s)]
*  leopards. We reintroduced hyenas. The lions, all by themselves, their numbers just took [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1828.46s)]
*  off. So from five or six lions when we started, we now have probably 200. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1834.46s)]
*  Gorin Gose's lion conservation is urgent because since 1950, Africa's lion population [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1840.46s)]
*  has fallen from half a million to 20,000 due to habitat loss and hunting. We saw how [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1847.46s)]
*  Gorin Gose is protecting its lions on a mission with park veterinarian Antonio Palo. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1855.46s)]
*  Okay, I'll shoot now. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1862.46s)]
*  Palo fired a tranquilizer dart right on target. And a 300 pound lioness led us on a chase. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1864.46s)]
*  Give me space. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1874.46s)]
*  She left us behind, but she couldn't outrun the sedative. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1876.46s)]
*  There she is. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1880.46s)]
*  Yeah, she's there. She's sleeping. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1881.46s)]
*  She'd be out about an hour as Dr. Palo changed her failing GPS collar. The signal goes to [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1884.46s)]
*  headquarters where they track the prides and herds. A bit of ear was nicked for genetic [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1892.46s)]
*  tests, and then there was a surprise. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1898.46s)]
*  You think she's pregnant? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1902.46s)]
*  Yeah, she looks like pregnant. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1903.46s)]
*  And there is the future of the park. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1905.46s)]
*  Yes, the future cubs of the park. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1907.46s)]
*  Later, she awoke and headed out with her future cub. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1911.46s)]
*  I never imagined it would go so well or so fast. In 2018, we did an aerial survey. So [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1916.46s)]
*  counting only the big animals, we counted 100,000 large animals from the air. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1926.46s)]
*  Thrilled as he is, it wasn't wildlife that drew this 63-year-old Idaho native to Africa. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1933.46s)]
*  In 2008, he introduced us to the 200,000 people living around the park, survivors of the wars, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1943.46s)]
*  living on a dollar a day. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1953.46s)]
*  People had nothing. I mean, they didn't have clothes. They were wearing rags or they had [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1956.46s)]
*  made clothes out of tree bark. They were eating insects and trying to catch mice. And, you [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1959.46s)]
*  know, that's when it struck me, well, this national park's going to have to help the [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1964.46s)]
*  people. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1968.46s)]
*  Today, Gorongosa National Park employs 1,600 workers. Tourism brings in cash, which goes [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1969.46s)]
*  to the people and to the park. And Greg Carr has partnered with the government on health [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1977.46s)]
*  care and education. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1984.46s)]
*  Carr is the biggest donor, but U.S. foreign aid kicks in about 6 million a year. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1987.46s)]
*  We now work in 89 primary schools, which is every single school that surrounds this national [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1993.46s)]
*  park. We are training 600 school teachers right now. Now think about how difficult it [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=1999.46s)]
*  is to create a school system when you don't have school teachers that know how to read [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2004.46s)]
*  and write because of generations of war. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2009.46s)]
*  Now, something we really focused on as step one was really vulnerable girls. Now, a lot [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2012.46s)]
*  of times what happens in the poor families around here, a girl turns 13 or 14 and the [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2018.46s)]
*  family says, well, it's time for her to get married. Now, it may not be what they actually [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2022.46s)]
*  want, but they don't think there's another choice. And this is what happens and, you [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2026.46s)]
*  know, she marries a farmer and that's it. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2029.46s)]
*  So we started something called the Girls Club. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2033.46s)]
*  There are 3,000 girls in 92 after school clubs. The program is led by Larisa Souza. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2038.46s)]
*  Why is this the job of a conservation park? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2047.46s)]
*  Why not? It should be the job for everyone, for everyone. Education is for everyone. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2051.46s)]
*  The clubs provide the resources to get the girls into high school and it gives students [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2058.46s)]
*  an answer to our question, which five years ago wouldn't have made sense. What do you [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2065.46s)]
*  want to be? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2071.46s)]
*  We have a teacher, a nurse, a conservation park ranger and another nurse. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2074.46s)]
*  Yes. When we started the program, they didn't know that they had this choice. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2080.46s)]
*  And now they do. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2085.46s)]
*  Now they do. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2086.46s)]
*  This land belongs to these people. They've been here forever. It's their animals. It's [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2088.46s)]
*  their land. It's their trees. It's their cultural and spiritual heritage. It's an idea that [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2092.46s)]
*  came from my hero, Nelson Mandela. The idea was to create a human rights park. What does [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2098.46s)]
*  that mean? A park that cares about the people, a park that belongs to the people. So instead [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2106.46s)]
*  of a park turning its back on the people, a park opening itself to the people and saying, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2111.46s)]
*  this is your park, these are your animals, these are your opportunities. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2115.46s)]
*  We saw those opportunities on Mount Gorongosa, which was stripped of trees during the wars. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2118.46s)]
*  Here, Carr's nonprofit foundation is giving away coffee trees. 868 family farmers working [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2130.46s)]
*  for themselves are earning far more than ever, so they can't plant trees fast enough, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2139.46s)]
*  which reforests the mountain. Carr's foundation buys the beans at above the market rate and [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2146.46s)]
*  built the farmers a roasting plant. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2154.46s)]
*  There's no better example of Carr's model for lifting people and healing the wild. It's [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2160.46s)]
*  working, but the last 14 years haven't been sweet music alone. Since we were here in 2008, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2166.46s)]
*  there have been enormous roadblocks to this project. That's right. If I had known then [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2174.46s)]
*  what was going to come. What came was another civil war in 2013, and then in 2019, a cyclone [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2180.46s)]
*  leveled 100,000 homes. Okay, there was the six years of war, and then the cyclone. When [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2191.46s)]
*  cyclone and die hit, basically every one of our employees became a first responder. So [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2199.46s)]
*  in other words, oh, there's an elephant right there. Well, there certainly is. I just have [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2205.46s)]
*  to stop and say hello to the elephant. We couldn't find the wildlife in 2008. And now [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2212.46s)]
*  they're interrupting our interview. They're walking in on the interview. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2218.46s)]
*  Well, was there ever a time that you thought to yourself, I did my best, but this just [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2225.46s)]
*  isn't going to be humanly possible? Not for a second. Not for one second. With the cyclones, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2230.46s)]
*  with the return of the civil war. I just think every time something like that happens, it [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2236.46s)]
*  just makes you more determined, not less determined. And when you've got people suffering in a [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2243.46s)]
*  war that need help, or people suffering in a cyclone that need help, you're more committed. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2248.46s)]
*  You don't lose commitment at a time like that. We saw commitment in the rangers who protect [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2253.46s)]
*  the park. For the flora and the fauna, they sing, we will die for our park. Part of what [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2263.46s)]
*  they protect are endangered species, including this mammal with a bottomless taste for termites. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2278.2200000000003s)]
*  Pangolins are hunted for their scales, which are prized in folk medicine. Veterinary in [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2286.42s)]
*  Mercia, Angela told us that Pangolins ride on their mother's backs. Oh, hello there. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2291.94s)]
*  But we found any back will do. That's funny, he just naturally goes right up to the shoulder [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2298.5s)]
*  and hangs on your back. Yeah. Powerful tail. Yeah, the tail is very powerful. They also [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2304.4s)]
*  are used for protection. I'm surprised they're so docile. I mean, this is a wild animal. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2311.58s)]
*  Yes, it's a wild animal. Success, eh? But for us, the most interesting animal in the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2318.9s)]
*  park is Greg Carr, an entrepreneur with the empathy to see, the humility to listen, and [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2326.1s)]
*  the optimism to act. His business model is creating a new ecosystem where animals that [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2336.86s)]
*  were hunted are suddenly worth much more alive. How much of your personal fortune have [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2343.86s)]
*  you put into this? Well, I'd like to keep that a secret, but unfortunately I think, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2350.94s)]
*  you could probably do the math and figure it out. It's more than $100 million. My message [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2358.06s)]
*  to anybody with money is, I mean, what are you going to do? Stick it all in your casket? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2364.06s)]
*  I mean, why not enjoy the joy of philanthropy? I would say to the billionaire next door, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2368.5s)]
*  go out and enjoy spending your money to help some people. Find your gorongosa. Go find [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2376.02s)]
*  your gorongosa and it will bless you more than you can possibly ever bless it. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2383.54s)]
*  There are more than 75,000 wild horses roaming public land in the West. Wild horses are the [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2399.5s)]

*  left unchecked, their population can double every five years. So when we heard about a [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2432.02s)]
*  program in Wyoming designed to rein in the wild horses and an unlikely group of men, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2437.06s)]
*  we headed west. It's hard to imagine anything surviving on this stretch of badlands in northern [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2443.1s)]
*  Wyoming. Sagebrush blankets the high desert all the way to the Rocky Mountains. But in [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2451.1s)]

*  wild, and breathtakingly beautiful. But wild horses can also wreck the rangelands they [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2465.7799999999997s)]
*  roam. Government land managers say in the West, wild horses are competing with cattle [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2473.66s)]
*  and wildlife for increasingly scarce water and food and their overpopulation often further [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2479.18s)]

*  of food and they need to be properly managed. Keeping count of all those horses is Holly [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2564.2000000000003s)]
*  Waddell, the division chief of the program that oversees wild horses for the Bureau of [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2569.7200000000003s)]
*  Land Management. How many wild horses is the government now caring for? So we are currently [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2574.88s)]
*  caring for over 57,000 wild horses. And caring for them is not inexpensive? No. The cost [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2581.56s)]
*  to care for wild horses in our off-range corrals and pastures was two-thirds of our budget [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2588.6s)]
*  last year, which was a little over $70 million. $70 million to care for the wild horses. Taxpayer [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2593.84s)]
*  dollars. To relieve some of the burden on taxpayers, last year the Bureau says 3,742 [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2601.84s)]
*  mustangs came off the government rolls through an incentive program that pays individuals [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2609.72s)]
*  a thousand dollars to adopt one. Wild horses attract relatively few takers, but these horses [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2614.4s)]
*  did. Picked for their youth, balance and temperament that are sent to be trained in, of all places, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2621.48s)]
*  prisons like the Wyoming Honour Farm. It's a 640-acre compound of tidy buildings, manicured [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2628.64s)]
*  lawns, cattle and enough hay to feed them. It may look like a dude ranch, but this is [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2636.88s)]
*  a state-run minimum security prison with felons working the land and the horses. There [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2642.56s)]
*  are no towers or armed guards. A simple four-foot cattle fence marks the perimeter between the [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2648.7999999999997s)]
*  prison and the town of Riverton, Wyoming. Wyoming has a tendency to do things a little [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2655.52s)]
*  differently because we're a smaller state and I think it's one of those things until [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2661.2799999999997s)]
*  you see it you can't actually believe it yourself. Curtis Moffett has spent his entire career [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2665.84s)]
*  in corrections. He's the warden on the farm and about the only one here who doesn't wear [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2671.12s)]
*  cowboy boots to work. The thing that struck me when you drive up you see the four-foot [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2675.92s)]
*  high cattle fence. What's to stop an inmate from making a run for it or riding off into [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2681.24s)]
*  the sunset? Realistically himself. Most of these guys are at the end of their sentence, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2687.16s)]
*  so most of them don't want to destroy that or you know catch another number, do another [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2691.52s)]
*  five years or so. It's on them to make sure that they're going to do things the right way. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2696.96s)]
*  Most inmates have earned the right to be here, transferred for good behavior from more restrictive [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2702.96s)]
*  state prisons and each day about 30 inmates report to work in a maze of chutes and pens [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2708.4s)]
*  with wild horses weighing up to a thousand pounds. Their job is to transform these mustangs [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2714.7200000000003s)]
*  from wild burdens of the state into riding horses that can fetch thousands at auction. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2721.52s)]
*  These guys are here to do their time but it's really about changing their life, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2727.52s)]
*  put a change in them in a positive direction. Travis Shoopman is the cowboy in charge. He's [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2732.56s)]
*  the manager of the farm. Come on beauty queens. Shoopman spent his life teaching the art of [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2738.88s)]
*  training horses. It shows in a stride kinked by old fractures. Have you ever had a halter on this [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2744.4s)]
*  horse Mr. Sukor? Never. And a voice both firm and calm as much for the inmates as the horses. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2749.92s)]
*  Do the rope a dope and throw the rope into your hand. Do not get kicked. It takes time to train [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2755.84s)]
*  a wild horse but Shoopman says there's nothing special about how it starts. You walk them in [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2761.04s)]
*  there like you just kind of rip off the band-aid and the human goes in there. Don't chase him. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2766.48s)]
*  Whoa. What's the next step? Then you teach them to yield the pressure so you stop the forward movement, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2771.6s)]
*  teach them that if they move forward towards you the pressure goes away. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2777.04s)]
*  And then from there you get to where you can touch them, you get to where you can pet them, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2781.28s)]
*  introduce a halter, get them halter broke and then you have that trust. Like they understand if they [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2785.12s)]
*  give up their ride of flight to stay with you there's some trust there. Are you talking about [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2792.48s)]
*  the horses? The horses. Keep going hey. We are in the people business and helping the horses is [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2797.76s)]
*  extra but the guys really learn a lot of life lessons from the horses. They learn to try, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2804.56s)]
*  they learn to not lie to themselves about their feelings, they learn to control whether it's the [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2809.92s)]
*  highest of high emotions or the lowest of low emotions. No one here breaks a horse. The method [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2815.92s)]
*  used at the farm is called gentling. Force is replaced by patience, persistence and an even [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2822.64s)]
*  keel. In any pen on any day you can see it play out a ballet in dusty boots. A delicate dance of [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2828.64s)]
*  inches repeated a hundred times over days in the making for this the first human touch. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2838.64s)]
*  Next door a Mustang in full gallop, a runaway train yields and stops on command. There you go, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2846.7999999999997s)]
*  you got a good win. We're watching all these things step by step by step but this doesn't happen [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2855.04s)]
*  overnight. No sometimes it'll take four weeks, sometimes it'll take four months to do these [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2860.56s)]
*  steps and a wild horse takes a little bit longer sometimes. Michael Davis has been riding horses [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2866.0s)]
*  his whole life. He's serving 15 to 20 years for voluntary manslaughter. He's eligible for parole [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2872.6400000000003s)]
*  in a little over three years. If you're mad, if you're scared, a horse knows before you ever [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2879.6s)]
*  even touch him, you know, how they know I don't. You have to control your feelings considerably [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2884.72s)]
*  with the horse because it it is so easy for them to pick up on your mood. So you're good at controlling [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2889.7599999999998s)]
*  your feelings with the horse but with people how are you doing? Not real great. You're still working [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2894.96s)]
*  on that? I have my moments. I'm still working on it but we're getting better. Davis is an old cowboy [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2899.04s)]
*  and one of only a few inmates here who can handle this. This horse has never had a man on its back [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2905.36s)]
*  until now. Hey whoa. A remarkable skill that can't be acquired without a few scars. I've got [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2912.2400000000002s)]
*  broken ankle, a separated shoulder, a broken collarbone, ditches in my head, broken hand, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2921.2000000000003s)]
*  fingers, lots of fingers. What's the program taught you? What's it meant to you? A little [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2928.0s)]
*  piece of freedom. I mean I'm wearing boots and jeans instead of hospital scrubs and I mean it's [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2933.36s)]
*  hot out here but it's a good hot. It's as close to being outside as I can get until I get outside. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2939.6s)]
*  Out here it's easy to forget this is a prison with 300 inmates under the watchful eye of Ward [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2946.1600000000003s)]
*  Moffett. People at home will say like these guys are felons. They've done terrible things, committed [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2952.4s)]
*  awful crimes, ruined families. Why should they be allowed to be out here, to be trusted, to be [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2957.52s)]
*  working with these horses? We don't provide the sentence to them. We don't provide the punishment [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2963.2s)]
*  for them. The judge decided all that. Our job is supervising while they're in here and hopefully [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2967.12s)]
*  return them to societies where they're responsible individuals, where they can be law-abiding [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2972.72s)]
*  citizens. I think this program goes a long way to do that and I want to make sure they get out [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2977.28s)]
*  and we can believe that they're going to be successful and they aren't going to reoffend. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2983.44s)]
*  You want to make sure right that the horses aren't returned and the inmates don't return. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2987.2s)]
*  Right. Is that fair to say? Right. In Wyoming the recidivism rate is below 30 percent and if you're [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2992.16s)]
*  wondering about that four-foot cattle fence well the warden says in the last 22 years [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=2998.7999999999997s)]
*  fewer than 10 inmates have made a run for it. Come back down to a walk. Staying on the right [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3004.24s)]
*  side of the fence is not lost on Payton Sukor, an inmate serving seven to ten years for aggravated [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3009.4399999999996s)]
*  assault. He transferred from a maximum security prison a year ago and came here with no experience [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3015.44s)]
*  working with horses. What's it like to step into a pen the first time with a wild 800 pound horse? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3022.2400000000002s)]
*  Adrenaline, heart pounding excitement but I was excited to do it because once you get a horse to [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3028.96s)]
*  go the direction you want and then come and join up to you and you turn around and he's right there [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3036.2400000000002s)]
*  and it's like wow this animal this connection this feeling I can't explain it. What has this [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3041.68s)]
*  taught you about yourself? It's taught me responsibility. It's taught me what I want to do [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3049.2s)]
*  for a career when I get out of here and this makes you look at life a whole different way. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3056.3999999999996s)]
*  Whoa. In Sukor's patients and feel are paying off. An auction at gilding like this one could sell for [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3062.7999999999997s)]
*  thousands but it's not without a little heartache. Is it hard to see them go? It is but at the same [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3069.28s)]
*  time we're not doing this just for us we're doing it for them too it's a second chance for them as [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3076.1600000000003s)]
*  well. Have you ridden him without a tie down? Yes ma'am. This September the honor farm held its second [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3080.96s)]
*  auction of the year. Hundreds of buyers came to the prison from all over the country to inspect [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3087.28s)]
*  these horses and query their trainers. Little like kicking the tires on a car lot. Hit 500 [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3092.32s)]
*  dollar now make it five make it five anybody put in the five. Then each Mustang takes the main stage [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3098.24s)]
*  trotting and loping sold to the highest bidder. Sold out 2500. All right here we go. In all 34 [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3103.4399999999996s)]
*  horses fetched 65,000 dollars for the Bureau of Land Management an achievement almost as good as [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3111.2s)]
*  the look on the inmates faces. But remember Michael Davis the old cowboy who couldn't be bucked? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3117.9199999999996s)]
*  We noticed he wasn't at the auction. The warden told us he was suspended for not getting along [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3125.76s)]
*  with others. Gentling a horse and rehabilitating the man don't always happen on the same clock. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3131.44s)]
*  By high noon every Mustang had a new home and for this wild bunch gentling has its virtues. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3139.2000000000003s)]
*  I think I know the answer to this. If you were a betting man would you bet a psychologist is [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3146.2400000000002s)]
*  quicker to change the behavior of a man a doctor a therapist or a horse? I think a horse 100 and [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3151.04s)]
*  that's just purely Travis Schutman talking but the horses are a major role in what betters those men. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3158.08s)]
*  They can teach you life lessons every step of every way teach you that you got something in you that [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3164.56s)]
*  you didn't think you had. They can teach you that it's okay to be afraid but it can still be done. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3170.32s)]
*  Nothing's impossible there's so many life lessons. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cfqQllZbr4&t=3175.28s)]
