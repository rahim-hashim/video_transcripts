# Volcanoes, Hurricanes, Avalanche, Wildfires | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [February 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU)
*  If you think we're living in an unstable world, just listen to this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=0.0s)]
*  Only 1% of our Earth is solid rock. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=18.34s)]
*  Most of the other 99% is an oozing mass churning beneath our feet like road tar at temperatures [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=21.98s)]
*  between 2000 and 10,000 degrees. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=28.62s)]
*  The Earth's crust is only 20 miles thick. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=32.06s)]
*  When that cracks, one of the greatest forces in nature erupts. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=35.86s)]
*  There are 1,500 active volcanoes and tonight we want to tell you about three. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=40.5s)]
*  One that caused the most recent mass disruption, another that's the biggest threat to a major [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=46.66s)]
*  and a third in the United States that could wreak havoc all around the world. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=52.42s)]
*  The first, the disruptive volcano, has a name as long and as hard as the trouble it caused. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=62.78s)]
*  Ajaflatlajök means island mountain glacier in the inscrutable language of Iceland. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=69.26s)]
*  When it blew in 2010, we started shooting this story and we came to the right place. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=76.58s)]
*  Over the last 500 years, Iceland's 30 volcanoes have released one third of all of the lava [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=86.46s)]
*  on Earth. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=94.02s)]
*  We put together an expedition to be the first to reach the summit after the eruption. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=97.74s)]
*  The volcanic landscape covered in ice isn't hospitable to life or convoys for that matter. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=103.66s)]
*  The man in front of the truck is pointing out cracks in the glacier that would swallow [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=110.02s)]
*  us whole. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=115.06s)]
*  We covered miles of forbidding terrain at walking speed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=116.34s)]
*  When the trucks could go no further, we hiked with our guide, one of the world's leading [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=123.58s)]
*  authorities on volcanoes, Araldur Sigurdsson. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=127.69999999999999s)]
*  Wow, that is astounding. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=131.5s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=134.26s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=136.58s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=140.26s)]
*  What a sight. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=141.26s)]
*  Looking right into the crater. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=146.06s)]
*  Scientists rate volcanic eruptions on a scale of zero to eight. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=149.02s)]
*  This is a four, which they call cataclysmic. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=153.14s)]
*  Tell me what you're seeing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=157.78s)]
*  It's an explosive eruption and explosions are producing big clouds of ash that are moving [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=159.06s)]
*  up straight up into the atmosphere at a velocity of a few hundred feet per second and throwing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=164.78s)]
*  out huge rocks. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=171.58s)]
*  How big are these pieces that we see flying? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=172.98s)]
*  Some of these are the size of cars. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=175.5s)]
*  And how high are they going up? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  Must be a thousand feet. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  Oh, at least a thousand feet, but they're still red hot. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  They're maybe 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=182.9s)]
*  That's causing these stupendous explosions that we're hearing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=185.34s)]
*  Well the big booms that we're hearing are huge gas bubbles in the magma that are popping [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=191.78s)]
*  open. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=196.38000000000002s)]
*  They may be a hundred feet in diameter and when they get closer to the surface, the pressure [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=197.38000000000002s)]
*  inside these gas bubbles is so great that they blow off the magma that is ahead of them [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=202.18s)]
*  and then they release the gas and that's a big sonic boom. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=207.62s)]
*  Look at the earth just erupting up into the sky. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=214.18s)]
*  This is a great place to explain exactly where volcanoes happen on the earth. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=217.18s)]
*  The crust of the earth of course is fractured like a broken mirror and it's fractured into [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=222.86s)]
*  about 15 major plates called tectonic plates. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  Volcanoes happen all around the edges where the earth's crust is fractured and here in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=232.94s)]
*  Iceland, a major line runs right through the middle of the island and the two plates are [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=238.54000000000002s)]
*  breaking apart and that's exactly what you see happening behind me. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=244.04s)]
*  No, no you don't see anything happening behind you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=248.64s)]
*  What ruined our view was steam. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=253.28s)]
*  It was exploding everywhere that the lava hit the ice. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  The ancient glacier was melting in a flash flood, carving canyons into the mountain. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=261.8s)]
*  The thermal shock also lofted a fine black ash that covered farms for miles. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=269.84s)]
*  They call it ash but it really feels like sand. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=276.32s)]
*  In Iceland, volunteers come out from the cities to help farmers dig out. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  These were bankers who brought their shovels from the capital Reykjavik. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=285.23999999999995s)]
*  It was this ash that made Eiaflatleuk the most disruptive eruption in years. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  The ash billowed up nearly 33,000 feet and drifted a thousand miles over Europe. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=296.94s)]
*  100,000 flights were cancelled. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=304.26s)]
*  10 million people were stranded for a week. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=306.98s)]
*  Still, volcanologist Haraldur Sigurdsson told us that kind of trouble is nothing compared [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=310.94s)]
*  to eruptions elsewhere in the recent past. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=317.58s)]
*  The best example of that occurred in 1815 when there was an eruption in Tambora volcano [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=321.26s)]
*  in Indonesia. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=326.78s)]
*  A big explosive eruption sent out an ash cloud up to about 30 miles and it dispersed very [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=327.78s)]
*  widely and also a lot of sulfur came out of this volcano and that led to global cooling [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=334.7s)]
*  and produced what is known as the year without a summer in New England, in North America. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=342.32s)]
*  The year without a summer? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=347.05999999999995s)]
*  The year without a summer, 1816. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=348.05999999999995s)]
*  Because of this one volcanic eruption? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  On the other side of the earth. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=352.26s)]
*  And that type of event will occur again. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=353.7s)]
*  That eruption also led to big migrations out of Central Europe into Russia and great disturbances [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=357.09999999999997s)]
*  worldwide. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=363.86s)]
*  Which volcano on earth would you say is most dangerous to people? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=365.5s)]
*  It's the volcano where there's a very large population adjacent to it and on it and that's [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=368.78s)]
*  Vesuvius in Italy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=374.5s)]
*  Vesuvius is our second stop and you might think that if anyone knew better than to live [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=376.9s)]
*  by a volcano it would be the people around the most infamous mountain of all time. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=382.1s)]
*  But today in southern Italy a metropolis spreads within striking distance of Vesuvius. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=390.54s)]
*  Nobody wants to believe that the area that they live in could kill them. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=397.46000000000004s)]
*  We went for a look up close with American volcanologist Mike Sheridan. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=402.02000000000004s)]
*  We flew over the cinder cone on the helicopters of the Guardia di Finanza, a police force [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=407.42s)]
*  that helps keep watch over the mountain. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=412.86s)]
*  Vesuvius is Sheridan's life's work and he has warned the government that it can't count [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=415.58s)]
*  on evacuating the number of people in harm's way. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=421.1s)]
*  And what is that number? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=425.34000000000003s)]
*  Well it depends on the type of explosion. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=426.34000000000003s)]
*  If there's one like the last big eruption that occurred in 1631 there would be about [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=430.34s)]
*  600,000 people. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=436.02s)]
*  But if it is an eruption like the 2000 year ago eruption that destroyed Pompeii the number [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=437.02s)]
*  could be up to 3.5 million. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=446.02s)]
*  Pompeii as it was August 24th 79 A.D. the moment it was preserved under more than 10 [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=448.94s)]
*  feet of ash and rock. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=455.97999999999996s)]
*  The boulevards, the homes, the mosaics are the volcano's contribution to history. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=458.26s)]
*  Round here they do a lively business in the dead. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=466.74s)]
*  Citizens of Pompeii are frozen in timeless agony. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=470.7s)]
*  About 16,000 were killed, sculpted where they fell. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=474.98s)]
*  Scientists have a good idea of what these people saw after studying the evidence of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=480.34s)]
*  what remains. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=484.65999999999997s)]
*  Witnesses describe the mountain rumbling for days before it launched a column of ash [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=486.18s)]
*  and rock 12 miles high which fell back as hell on earth. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=491.54s)]
*  The wind came shooting down the sides of the mountain at more than 200 miles an hour. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=497.86s)]
*  The air temperature was about 900 degrees and the ash that fell throughout the region [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=503.42s)]
*  left this part of Italy uninhabitable for 300 years. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=509.82s)]
*  Today from this control room, volcanologist Giuseppe Mastro Lorenzo monitors the instruments [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=516.02s)]
*  that will provide Italy's early warning. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=521.6999999999999s)]
*  He showed us those 3.5 million people that crowd all around the cinder cone of the mountain. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=524.9s)]
*  One day it may be up to him to sound the alarm. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=532.3s)]
*  How much time will you have? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=536.9s)]
*  Probably just a few days. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=538.8199999999999s)]
*  We can just hope that we will have weeks or months but we cannot make a contract with [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=541.4s)]
*  the volcano. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=549.0s)]
*  So your friends say, look it hasn't erupted in hundreds of years and you must say that's [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=550.52s)]
*  the problem. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=555.28s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=556.28s)]
*  I'm trying to convince the people that this quiet mountain can be a killer. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=557.28s)]
*  At the base of the quiet mountain, the peaceful Piazza of Torre del Greco is wiped out on [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=564.52s)]
*  average about once every 100 years, give or take. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=569.96s)]
*  The bell towers survived the eruption of 1794 and today old men rest their feet on rock [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=574.4000000000001s)]

*  statistics. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=971.14s)]
*  We can say absolutely without a doubt that this hurricane took place over altered background [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=972.14s)]
*  conditions. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=978.5799999999999s)]
*  Our planet is very different today than it would have been 50 or 100 years ago. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=980.18s)]
*  By altered background, she means that the oceans of 2017 are on track to be the third [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=985.12s)]
*  warmest on record. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=990.84s)]
*  Warmer water intensifies hurricanes three ways. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=992.92s)]
*  First of all, in a warmer world, more water evaporates into the atmosphere. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=996.92s)]
*  And so when a storm like a hurricane comes along, there's so much more water vapor sitting [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1001.52s)]
*  up there for that hurricane to sweep up and dump on us. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1005.82s)]
*  The second reason is sea level rise. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1008.58s)]
*  Water expands when it's heated. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1010.8s)]
*  And that means that when a hurricane comes along, the storm surges on average will be [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1012.3s)]
*  stronger because there's more water behind them. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1017.18s)]
*  And then the third way that we expect climate change to affect hurricanes is through warmer [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1019.4399999999999s)]
*  ocean waters. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1024.32s)]
*  More energy, more power will be available to hurricanes in the future, enabling them [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1026.58s)]
*  to intensify faster if conditions are right, as well as become more intense. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1031.3799999999999s)]
*  And that's apparently what we had with Harvey. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1036.78s)]
*  We're starting to see it. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1038.82s)]

*  begging and pleading, asking for detention basins, asking for drainage infrastructure [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1100.96s)]

*  Why? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1111.32s)]
*  It costs money. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1112.32s)]

*  Mr. Mayor, I talked to one of your constituents who uses words that I can't use on TV. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1147.8000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1153.0s)]
*  Alvester Turner has been mayor of Houston nearly two years. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1154.0s)]
*  I understand why people are mad right now. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1157.48s)]
*  Because of their projects on the books. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1160.28s)]
*  And the only thing that stopped those projects from being built was the funding. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1162.4s)]
*  There is a sense among citizens who have flooded homes that there has been a lack of urgency [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1165.72s)]
*  about starting these major mitigation projects. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1173.32s)]
*  I agree. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1176.0s)]
*  I agree with them. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1177.0s)]
*  Because all of these things are foreseeable. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1180.2s)]
*  Why haven't these things been done, Mr. Mayor? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1183.4s)]
*  Because there hasn't been the urgency on all levels to get them done. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1185.4s)]
*  And that's the sad part. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  The threat hasn't been ignored entirely. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1192.8400000000001s)]
*  The federal government has spent more than $100 million in the county over the years [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1195.4s)]
*  buying up homes in the floodplain. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1201.52s)]
*  But reams of flood control proposals fill the filing cabinets at City Hall. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1204.3600000000001s)]
*  Sometimes it takes an event to occur that shakes people to their core. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1210.6000000000001s)]
*  This storm has shaken people to their core. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1216.1200000000001s)]
*  People don't want to hear the rhetoric. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1220.0s)]
*  And I understand that. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1221.4s)]
*  The question then becomes, are you, as elected officials and others, operating with the greatest [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1222.76s)]
*  degree of urgency? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1229.68s)]
*  This is heartbreaking, guys. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1231.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1233.6000000000001s)]
*  These are those two flood control reservoirs that were built in the 1940s. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1235.72s)]
*  They are usually dry, which is why you see trees. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1240.96s)]
*  A 1996 study by the County Flood Control District called them severely outdated. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1244.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not hard to imagine, the study says, that a single storm event could have a catastrophic [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1252.52s)]
*  impact. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1258.24s)]
*  A proposed fix was stopped by the cost, $600 million in today's dollars. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1259.24s)]
*  But last month's catastrophic impact will be tens of billions. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1266.48s)]
*  The former head of the Flood Control District who promoted that study lives in this house. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1271.8s)]
*  He told us from the 1940s to Harvey, planning for the reservoirs went from quote, brilliance [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1281.16s)]
*  to neglect to stupidity to cruelty. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1288.36s)]
*  Over the decades, thousands of homes were built on the floodplain. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1294.76s)]
*  Hurricane Harvey was a human-contrived disaster. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1299.5200000000002s)]
*  So if we have flooding, that's a natural process. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1303.3600000000001s)]
*  A disaster is human-induced because we've put so many people in these flood-prone areas. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1306.2s)]
*  Sam Brody studies coastal development for Texas A&M University. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1312.5600000000002s)]
*  I think that climate change is one driver of this problem. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1317.4s)]
*  The Bay is rising, we measure that, it's going to continue to rise. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1322.84s)]
*  But if you think about climate change as one of the drivers to flood loss, it pales in [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1326.72s)]
*  the comparison to the human change and the development of the landscape and putting people [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1331.64s)]
*  more in harm's way. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1337.68s)]
*  That's a much bigger driver of the problem. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1340.28s)]
*  Well people like development, people like to have jobs. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1343.4s)]
*  And I think we need to promote that, but doing it in a way that is smarter, which means protecting [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1346.6s)]
*  the ecological functions of our landscape, wetlands, pulling away from these bayous. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1353.32s)]
*  And over the long term, we're going to have more stable economy, better economic growth, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1359.4399999999998s)]
*  because we're not going to be dragged down by these chronic flood events. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1364.32s)]
*  Harvey is also rewriting emergency response plans. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1369.08s)]
*  During the storm, 160 helicopters and 17,000 troops rode to the rescue. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1374.92s)]
*  We didn't want to hold anything back. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1383.4s)]
*  We wanted to be more prepared than surprised. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1385.4s)]
*  Major General John Nichols commands the Texas Guard. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1388.44s)]

*  Yes sir, we did. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1395.4s)]
*  We also have states that helped us, 22 states brought helicopters, 4 states brought troops. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1397.0s)]
*  If the storms of this size are going to be the norm in the future, what are you going [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1402.76s)]
*  to have to do? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1407.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's going to be the norm, but that could be an option. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1409.0s)]
*  We're used to a three day storm. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1414.1999999999998s)]
*  Hurricanes come in, they move fast, and they go three days. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1416.1999999999998s)]
*  We've not seen a storm that came in, I think, for six days, and dumps 50 plus inches of [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1419.0s)]
*  water in one place. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1425.24s)]

*  As the nation's fourth largest city begins to dry, ideas for the future include buying [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1439.08s)]
*  more people out of their homes in the flood plains, turning two little used golf courses [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1444.96s)]
*  into reservoirs, and building a massive sea gate to shield the ship channel from the Gulf. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1450.4399999999998s)]

*  On January 18, a series of earthquakes in central Italy triggered an avalanche. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1512.88s)]
*  It demolished the Hotel Rigopiano, then buried the ruins under 120,000 tons of snow, rocks, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1519.04s)]
*  and mountainside. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1528.64s)]
*  It took 10 hours for rescue crews to arrive at the remote and snowed-in resort, and no [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1530.24s)]

*  Forty guests and staff were gathered downstairs, trapped by the worst snowstorm in decades [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1582.9599999999998s)]
*  and spooked by a series of earthquakes that had rattled the hotel. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1589.04s)]

*  You went out to your car? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1612.52s)]
*  Yes, I went outside to the car, opened the car door, and then behind me I heard this [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1613.8400000000001s)]

*  I saw a tree, and I just stood near that tree. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1629.48s)]

*  Yes, the snow buried me a bit. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1637.5600000000002s)]
*  Then I got up, and when I turned around, I saw all the cars piled on top of each other, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1642.24s)]
*  and there was three, four meters of snow on top. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1649.48s)]

*  men bearing shovels and rescue equipment arrived on skis and snowshoes after a perilous trek [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1749.28s)]
*  through a blinding snowstorm. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1756.0s)]
*  Paolo De Quinsio led the patrol. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1758.3200000000002s)]
*  How long did it take you to get there? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1760.8400000000001s)]
*  It took us nearly four hours in the snowstorm. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1767.04s)]
*  Dangerous? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1770.92s)]
*  Very dangerous. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1772.28s)]
*  Pieces of snow kept falling from the side of the mountain. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1776.64s)]
*  It was pitch black. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1779.24s)]
*  De Quinsio and his men knew the area well and the hotel, but the four-story structure [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1782.24s)]
*  had all but disappeared. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1787.64s)]

*  Once we got there, we saw the lights of the two survivors in the car. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1795.0800000000002s)]
*  So we knew there were people there. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1799.0s)]
*  When we started to move around, we saw bits of material sticking out of the snow, so we [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1804.08s)]
*  knew we were in the right place and that's where the hotel was. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1808.56s)]
*  How were you physically and mentally at that point? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1812.6000000000001s)]
*  Destroyed. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1818.08s)]
*  Physically, my feet were practically frozen and so were my hands. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1819.08s)]
*  And emotionally, knowing that as they were taking me away with the sled, I was leaving [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1825.48s)]
*  my family there, I was in tremendous pain. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1831.92s)]

*  unveiled the extent of the tragedy. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1846.6000000000001s)]
*  By 7 a.m., helicopters were shuttling more rescue crews to the site, where they delicately [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1849.52s)]
*  began digging with hands and shovels, looking for other survivors. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1856.56s)]
*  With a mountain cut off from the rest of the countryside and concerns about more avalanches [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1861.56s)]
*  or earthquakes, the government set up a makeshift command center here 17 miles away from the [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1866.3600000000001s)]
*  disaster site. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1871.88s)]
*  It mobilized an emergency force of more than a thousand hardened professionals and highly [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1873.28s)]
*  skilled volunteers. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1878.7199999999998s)]
*  They were rushed here from all over Italy, mostly organized in well-trained 34-man teams [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1882.24s)]
*  that would work around the clock, alternating eight-hour shifts off and on the mountain. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1888.28s)]
*  At first, they didn't know where to dig. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1895.48s)]
*  The force of 120,000 tons of snow and debris slamming into the hotel at 50 miles an hour [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1899.24s)]
*  had crushed the structure and swiveled it off its foundation. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1906.12s)]
*  They had dogs to smell and all sorts of fancy equipment to listen, tunnelers to dig holes [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1911.04s)]
*  and snakers to go down in them. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1918.32s)]
*  Forty-one hours went by with no signs of life. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1922.2s)]
*  The rescuers had no way of knowing it, but there were nine survivors down there on the [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1925.2s)]
*  other side of the snow. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1930.12s)]
*  Among them, Giorgia Gallassi and Vincenzo Forti, who were sipping tea when the avalanche [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1932.8000000000002s)]
*  exploded through the hotel. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1938.0s)]
*  What did it sound like? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1940.92s)]
*  Like a bomb. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1944.88s)]
*  Yes, it was a roar and then everything fell. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1946.68s)]
*  I felt like a wave pushed over me. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1953.68s)]
*  That's what I felt. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1959.1200000000001s)]
*  And three seconds later you were in a hole. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1960.5s)]
*  A very dark, tiny hole. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1968.66s)]
*  Their cell phone flashlight revealed that they were trapped in a very small air pocket [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1971.34s)]
*  encased in snow, ice, broken timbers and tree limbs. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1976.06s)]
*  We immediately screamed to see if there was anybody else and we heard that there were [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1983.06s)]
*  other voices and other people and we communicated with them to know how they were. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1990.4199999999998s)]
*  How many people did you make contact with or could you hear? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=1995.7s)]
*  The two of us were close to each other and there was another girl, but we couldn't see [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2003.06s)]
*  the other girl and then a guy, I think he was behind us, who we couldn't see but we [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2007.34s)]
*  could hear and then a mother with a child we could hear. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2012.14s)]
*  You were there almost 60 hours, 50 some hours. How did you spend the time? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2017.42s)]
*  We slept, we spoke among each other, we did nothing. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2028.3400000000001s)]
*  Just waited? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2032.5400000000002s)]
*  Did you ever lose hope when you were down there? What's going through your mind when [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2036.26s)]
*  you were down there in the dark? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2040.34s)]
*  No, you're not thinking. We never lost hope that someone would come for us. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2043.02s)]
*  On January 20th, after two nights of being entombed, they finally heard the voices of [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2052.58s)]
*  rescuers above. It would take ten more hours to get them out. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2057.9s)]
*  That's a long time. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2062.9s)]
*  Yes, but it didn't weigh on us because we were so happy they had arrived. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2066.54s)]
*  And they always spoke to us and they made us calm. They always kept us in contact with [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2075.62s)]
*  them, they never gave up on us, not even for a moment, not one second in all those hours. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2080.34s)]
*  It was a miracle. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2087.84s)]
*  The true miracle was done by the rescuers. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2091.46s)]
*  I heard somewhere that you said you called them angels. Did that happen? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2094.3s)]
*  They take you out from underground, so it is fair to say they gave you life for a second [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2105.86s)]
*  time. If you can't call them angels, I don't know who the angels are at this point. My [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2110.46s)]
*  life, my second life, I owe it to them. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2117.98s)]
*  You do it because of what's in your heart. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2123.78s)]
*  Calling. Yes, it's a mission. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2125.78s)]
*  Gian Piero Peretti, the witness and messenger, was still in the hospital when he learned [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2128.78s)]
*  that his son, Gianfilippo, his wife Adriana, and finally, hours later, his six-year-old [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2134.1400000000003s)]
*  daughter, Ludovica, had all been pulled safely from the rubble. The little girl was evacuated [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2142.26s)]
*  to the hospital along with two other children that she'd been alone with in an air pocket. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2148.62s)]
*  They didn't know it at the time, but both of the young boys had been orphaned, their [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2153.9s)]
*  parents among the 29 dead. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2157.94s)]
*  I'm happy for myself, for my family, but I hold the people I met there that day in my [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2160.74s)]

*  I'm not celebrating. I feel I have a duty to respect their pain even though I'm happy [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2176.02s)]
*  for my family. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2183.02s)]
*  What should people take away from this, this story, this tale? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2185.02s)]
*  I think this story nurtures a sense of family because once you go through this, you can't [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2190.02s)]
*  help but see that one second you're here and the next you're gone. Unfortunately, it could [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2197.02s)]
*  have happened to me on the mountain, it could have happened to you in the street, and I [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2203.14s)]
*  think it's reawakened a desire for family, for prayer, for the important things in life. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2211.74s)]
*  In our society, we're always running around and we never sit still. Maybe we have to be [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2219.8599999999997s)]
*  reminded about what really matters. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2226.54s)]
*  Fighting wildfires in America cost federal agencies almost $2 billion last year, including [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2233.14s)]
*  more than half the budget of the U.S. Forest Service. Wildland fires are growing worse [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2246.66s)]
*  in a time of drought and climate change, and the biggest and most destructive fires can't [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2252.02s)]
*  be stopped. They are a force of nature. Imagine trying to stop a hurricane. Yet the government [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2256.7s)]
*  has to try because more than 100 million Americans now live in or near forests and grasslands [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2262.2599999999998s)]
*  that can erupt in flames. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2268.7799999999997s)]
*  This is what's left of a neighborhood in the Kern River Valley. It's outside Bakersfield, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2272.2599999999998s)]
*  California. Much of the valley burned in a wildfire that swept across 75 square miles. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2277.14s)]
*  It killed two people and destroyed 285 homes. The wildlands that fed this fire are the same [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2284.3399999999997s)]
*  wildlands that attracted residents like Fred Roach. Is this the view that brings people [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2291.42s)]
*  to live in this spot? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2297.42s)]
*  It's the view that brought us here. Yes, sir. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2299.02s)]
*  Roach lives amid mountains covered with grass so dry that lightning strikes or human activity [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2301.54s)]
*  can easily set it on fire. He used to be a firefighter and saw smoke rise over the valley [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2307.1400000000003s)]
*  on June 23rd. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2312.46s)]
*  The wind was blowing 20, 30 miles an hour and it came right at us. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2314.2200000000003s)]
*  The fire moved miles in a matter of minutes, faster than fire crews under Chief Brian Marshall [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2319.7s)]
*  could keep up. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2325.3799999999997s)]
*  I never expected this fire to do what it did. This is going to go down as one of the fastest [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2326.8599999999997s)]
*  spreading wildland fires in California's history. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2333.8599999999997s)]
*  Why did it spread so quickly? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2337.2999999999997s)]
*  Wind. Wind coupled with drought, hot, dry conditions on a summer day in the Kern River [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2338.9399999999996s)]
*  Valley and all we needed was a spark and there was no stopping that fire. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2344.8599999999997s)]
*  It kept burning despite the efforts of firefighters who spent $22 million trying to stop it. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2349.62s)]
*  Is there something the public doesn't get about the really big, fast moving, dangerous fires? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2356.2599999999998s)]
*  When you have the extreme fire behavior, when the weather, fuel and topography sets up, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2361.8199999999997s)]
*  there may not be anything that we can do. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2368.62s)]
*  More houses than ever lie within the reach of such fires. There are now 43 million homes [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2373.54s)]
*  in the area. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2379.58s)]
*  The fires are in every part of the country. Neighborhoods amid forests and grasslands [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2380.58s)]
*  are now so common they have their own special name. It's called the wildland urban interface [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2384.8199999999997s)]
*  where people can live close to nature and to the fires that burn there. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2390.94s)]
*  These homes are part of the urban interface. This entire community here is the urban interface [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2395.1s)]
*  and we are fighting wildland fires in the middle of these neighborhoods. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2401.86s)]
*  As more houses are built near wildlands, more of them burn. 50 years ago wildfires destroyed [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2407.22s)]
*  a few hundred structures per year across the United States. Now it's more than 3,000. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2413.0s)]
*  Last November wind driven wildfires near Gatlinburg, Tennessee killed 14 people and damaged or [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2421.06s)]
*  destroyed more than 2,400 homes and businesses. In Northern California the year before, this [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2427.62s)]
*  wildfire burned more than 1,000 homes helping to make 2015 the most destructive and costly [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2434.8599999999997s)]
*  year of wildfires in U.S. history. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2441.1s)]
*  There's a lot of homes here and they're really close to this fire. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2443.38s)]
*  Of the tens of thousands of wildfires that break out each year, only a few get this bad. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2447.22s)]
*  But they're the ones that burn the most land, destroy the most homes, and cost the most [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2453.14s)]
*  in often futile efforts to fight them. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2457.62s)]
*  Fire has always been part of the landscape. It will always be part of the landscape. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2461.62s)]
*  Robert Bonney was Undersecretary for Natural Resources and Environment at the U.S. Department [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2465.9s)]
*  of Agriculture during the Obama administration. For three and a half years he oversaw the [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2471.06s)]
*  Forest Service, the country's largest firefighting agency. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2476.3399999999997s)]
*  Over 1,000 engine strike teams were summoned to protect life and property from an inferno. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2481.66s)]
*  For decades, Forest Service crews tried to put out every fire by the next morning. It [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2486.26s)]
*  was a heroic undertaking with a side effect. They were stamping out fires that would normally [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2491.6200000000003s)]
*  have cleared out dead wood and undergrowth. Instead, that fuel built up over time, setting [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2496.7000000000003s)]
*  the stage for bigger fires. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2502.32s)]
*  Fires in a lot of those forests are burning differently than they did before. There are [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2504.9s)]
*  really two reasons for that. One is climate change. We're seeing weather patterns and [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2508.1800000000003s)]
*  extreme weather events, drought and other things that are causing those fires to burn [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2512.58s)]
*  differently. The second reason is because for so long we preached fire suppression and [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2515.74s)]
*  putting out those small fires, we've built up fuel loads. And so our fires are burning [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2520.94s)]
*  hotter, they're burning bigger, they're more catastrophic. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2526.42s)]
*  And the fire season, which once lasted a few months, now lasts almost all year. As the [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2530.1s)]
*  fires grew worse, more people were moving in. Since 1990, 60% of all the homes in the [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2535.54s)]
*  United States have been built in the wildland-urban interface, where the beauty comes with risks. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2542.1s)]
*  In 2012, a wildfire swept out of the Rockies and into these neighborhoods on the edge of [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2548.1s)]
*  Colorado Springs, destroying 347 homes. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2554.18s)]
*  The challenge is we've got houses in places we didn't use to have houses, and that puts [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2558.58s)]
*  people and property at risk. And so we're having to fight fire in a different way than [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2562.86s)]
*  we did before. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2568.46s)]
*  Tell me about the wildland-urban interface. Who's in control of it? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2569.78s)]
*  The federal government isn't in the business of land use. That's really done at the local [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2573.2200000000003s)]
*  county or municipal level. And the decisions that are made there have huge consequences [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2577.7400000000002s)]
*  for the American taxpayer because we will spend more money, and today are spending more [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2582.86s)]
*  money firefighting because of where those houses are in the landscape. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2587.42s)]
*  Private property owner buys land, gets permission from the county or whoever to build a house, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2591.9s)]
*  and the federal government ends up getting the bill to try to protect that house. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2597.78s)]
*  There's no question that we're spending more on the federal government side firefighting [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2601.0600000000004s)]
*  today because of houses in the landscape that we had nothing to do with approving. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2606.5s)]
*  Over the last 20 years, all federal agencies together have spent $25 billion to put out [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2612.1400000000003s)]
*  fires. Bonnie would rather spend some of that money thinning out forests before they burn. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2618.1000000000004s)]
*  We're not investing as much as we can and should in forest restoration because we're [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2623.46s)]
*  having to spend all our money fighting fire. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2628.62s)]
*  Wait a minute. Forest restoration is prevention of horrible wildfires. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2630.66s)]
*  That's right. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2635.2200000000003s)]
*  Are you taking money away from prevention? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2636.1s)]
*  Absolutely. The other issue is we put firefighters' lives in danger. If we ask them to fight fires, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2639.14s)]
*  that's essentially we can't stop. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2646.14s)]
*  It's real dicey in the subdivision. You've got to use your judgment. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2648.26s)]
*  Since 1990, a total of 468 firefighters have died in the wildlands, including these men. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2652.14s)]
*  They were elite firefighters known as the Granite Mountain Hotshots. In 2013, they deployed [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2659.58s)]
*  to fight this fire outside Yarnell, Arizona. Time-lapse video shows how the wind shifted [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2666.3399999999997s)]
*  the fire in a dangerous new direction. The 19 men were trapped and killed. In the town [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2673.2599999999998s)]
*  they died trying to protect, no residents were hurt, but 129 buildings burned. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2679.58s)]
*  Events like this add urgency to the work at a U.S. Forest Service lab. In this building [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2688.3s)]
*  in Missoula, Montana, scientists study how fires spread. And one of them, Jack Cohen, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2693.34s)]
*  made a specialty of how to better defend homes. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2699.02s)]
*  Clearly we're not going to solve the problem by telling people they're going to have to [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2702.18s)]
*  move their houses into a city from being out in the woods. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2705.38s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2709.38s)]
*  Right, it's not going to happen. For a whole bunch of reasons. One of which is that the [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2710.34s)]
*  population who live there, including me, aren't going to do it. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2713.94s)]
*  Is it reasonable for a homeowner in that situation, a fire bearing down in their neighborhood, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2720.46s)]
*  to just say, look, I pay my taxes, there are firefighters, there's a fire department, the [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2724.38s)]
*  Forest Service, if it's public land, has thousands of firefighters, it's their job, put it out. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2729.26s)]
*  So what if they can't? Then the question becomes one of, well, if the extreme wildfires are [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2733.86s)]
*  inevitable, does that mean that wildland urban fire disasters are inevitable? And my answer [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2739.7400000000002s)]
*  to that is no. At no point did anybody identify how homes ignited. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2745.78s)]
*  Cohen realized that if he understood the way houses catch fire, he could figure out how [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2752.78s)]
*  to protect them. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2757.38s)]
*  What ignited this house and burned it down were the little things. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2758.94s)]
*  Cohen learned that a wildfire throws up a blizzard of embers that wind can drive up [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2762.9s)]
*  to a mile. The embers, also known as firebrands, start new fires if they land on something [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2767.9s)]
*  flammable, like wooden shingles, wooden decks, firewood against a wall, pine needles in a [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2773.9s)]
*  gutter. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2780.9s)]
*  And most frequently, the things that it's igniting is debris around the structure. It's [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2781.9s)]
*  the stuff that's there primarily because we live there. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2787.9s)]
*  Jack Cohen says he knows these are danger spots because he ran simulations with life-sized [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2791.9s)]
*  homes in a lab. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2797.9s)]
*  We have firebrand generators, and you can watch millions of these brands then begin [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2799.9s)]
*  to collect wherever they land. If the base of the house has flammable material, we end [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2805.9s)]
*  up with fire. We see the gutters igniting and putting flame right up against the EVE [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2812.9s)]
*  line. What if we don't have anything that can support fire within five feet of the [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2818.9s)]
*  structure? What if we don't have pine needles in the gutters, right? Then the firebrands, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2824.9s)]
*  it doesn't matter from how far they come, don't ignite anything. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2830.9s)]
*  Just clean the gutters? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2835.9s)]
*  Clean the gutters. Clean the debris off your deck. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2836.9s)]
*  Last summer's fast-moving fire in Kern County, California became a real-world demonstration [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2841.9s)]
*  of Jack Cohen's research. Kern County requires property owners to clear 100 feet of defensible [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2846.9s)]
*  space around homes. You can tell the ones who probably did, and the ones who likely [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2852.9s)]
*  didn't. One week before the fire, an inspection found that one house looked like this. A week [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2857.9s)]
*  later, the house looked like this. Fire Chief Brian Marshall says he didn't have enough [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2863.9s)]
*  fire engines in the county to protect every vulnerable home. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2868.9s)]
*  Maybe 100 foot of defensible space isn't enough for this house, but it didn't have [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2872.9s)]
*  any. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2879.9s)]
*  If you were just driving through Kern County, you might think it's completely random that [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2880.9s)]
*  this house burned and this one didn't. The owner says it's not. It's the house of Fred [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2884.9s)]
*  Roach that retired Forest Service firefighter. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2889.9s)]
*  This house right here was prepared and did not need the air tanker full of retardant [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2892.9s)]
*  or the helicopter full of water or all the engines to protect it. It protects itself. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2899.9s)]
*  Fred Roach thought about fire when improving his home and says anyone can do what he did. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2905.9s)]
*  The house was stuccoed about five years ago, and we stuccoed everything under the eaves, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2910.9s)]
*  the entire thing. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2914.9s)]
*  Is the ducco basically fireproof? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2915.9s)]
*  Basically. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2917.9s)]
*  Close to it. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2918.9s)]
*  Close to it. And then we took all the redwood decking off the deck and replaced it with [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2919.9s)]
*  synthetic. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2923.9s)]
*  Which doesn't burn nearly as easily. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2924.9s)]
*  We had embers all over this deck and nothing happened. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2926.9s)]
*  So now that you're retired, do you still find yourself mentally triaging houses as [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2929.9s)]
*  you drive past them? That one's defensible, that one is hopeless? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2933.9s)]
*  Of course I do. Yeah. We discuss it all the time, my wife and I. I sure wish that they [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2936.9s)]
*  do this or I sure wish that they do that. There's nothing we can do about it. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2942.9s)]
*  Which is frustrating to Judy Hyatt. She's president of the Kern River Valley Fire Safe [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2946.9s)]
*  Council. It urges homeowners to make their homes less flammable. Many people tell her [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2951.9s)]
*  they don't have time. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2956.9s)]
*  When people have not properly prepared their homes, what do they expect from their fire [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2957.9s)]
*  department when fire approaches? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2962.9s)]
*  They expect them to be there, particularly the aircraft. And most of the time they are, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2963.9s)]
*  maybe this fire will cause people to have second thoughts because this time they couldn't [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2969.9s)]
*  be there and couldn't keep up with what was going on when they did get there. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2973.9s)]
*  Do you think that most homes could be built and maintained in such a way that when a fire [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2978.9s)]
*  approaches, people could just evacuate, wait for the fire to pass and otherwise ignore it? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2983.9s)]
*  I do. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2988.9s)]
*  Meaning we could do a lot less to fight fires and just be prepared better at the beginning? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2989.9s)]
*  You have to be prepared better before you do less because right now we're not. We really [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0OPkBJsPNU&t=2994.9s)]
