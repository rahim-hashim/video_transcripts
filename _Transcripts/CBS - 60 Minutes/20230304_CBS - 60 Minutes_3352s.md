**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [March 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y)
*  When Congress returns after the elections on Tuesday, it'll face one of the most hotly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  debated issues in the campaign, raising taxes on the rich. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=18.5s)]
*  That's President Obama's position, to keep the Bush tax cuts in place except for those [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=23.46s)]
*  on the wealthiest 2% as a way to reduce the dreaded deficit. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=28.44s)]
*  It's an idea already percolating among the governors. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=33.44s)]
*  Eight states have increased so-called millionaire income taxes so far as a way of avoiding [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=36.88s)]
*  drastic budget cuts on health and education. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=42.56s)]
*  And on Tuesday, voters could make Washington state the ninth. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=45.88s)]
*  But with our national debt in the trillions, budget experts will tell you that just taxing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=50.8s)]
*  the rich isn't enough. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=55.88s)]
*  One Republican brave enough to go public is David Stockman, President Reagan's budget [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=58.68s)]
*  director. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=63.88s)]
*  He says all the Bush tax cuts should be eliminated, even those on the middle class. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=65.12s)]
*  And he says his own Republican party has gone too far with its anti-tax religion. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  Tax cutting is a religion. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=80.4s)]
*  It's become, in the sense, an absolute, something that can't be questioned, something that's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=81.4s)]
*  gospel, something that's sort of embedded in the catechism. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=87.36s)]
*  And so scratch the average Republican today and he'll say, tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  Cut taxes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=96.72s)]
*  Cutting taxes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=97.72s)]
*  Make the tax cuts permanent. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  It's rank demagoguery. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  We should call it for what it is. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=102.62s)]
*  If these people were all put into a room on penalty of death to come up with how much [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=104.56s)]
*  they could cut, they couldn't come up with 50 billion when the problem is 1.3 trillion. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=109.1s)]
*  So to stand before the public and rub raw this anti-tax sentiment, the Republican party, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=114.82s)]
*  as much as it pains me to say this, should be ashamed of themselves. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  This from Ronald Reagan's old budget director, architect of the largest tax cut in American [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=128.16s)]
*  history. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=133.5s)]
*  But he doesn't let the Democrats off the hook. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=134.66s)]
*  He says he cringes when he hears the president say things like this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=137.2s)]
*  I believe we ought to make the tax cuts for the middle class permanent. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  We have now got both parties essentially telling a big lie with a capital B and a capital L [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=145.7s)]
*  to the public. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  And that is that we can have all this government, 24% of GDP, this huge entitlement program, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  all of the bailouts, and yet we don't have to tax ourselves and pay our bills. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  That is a, that's delusional. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=164.76s)]
*  Why isn't this statement correct? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=167.0s)]
*  We cannot really deal with the deficit until we get our recovery underway. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=170.22s)]
*  The recovery has already happened. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=175.92s)]
*  It is weak. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=177.92s)]
*  It is tepid. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=179.12s)]
*  How can you say the recovery has happened when we have 10% unemployment? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=180.12s)]
*  The unemployment rate is not going to drop by any material amount anytime soon. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=184.82s)]
*  And we're going to be in a period of austerity. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=190.56s)]
*  We've had a 30-year spree of really phony prosperity in this country. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=193.44s)]
*  Now our national debt is growing by $100 billion a month. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=199.68s)]
*  For those who say cutting spending is the answer, Stockman says both parties have thrown [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  in the towel on that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=209.52s)]
*  Finally, even the Republicans have said there's nothing significant we want to cut. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=211.36s)]
*  They don't want to cut Social Security entitlements. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=216.32s)]
*  They don't want to cut Medicare reimbursement to doctors, farm subsidies, education loans [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=218.0s)]
*  for middle-class students, certainly not defense. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=223.28s)]
*  Many of the states are in the same boat facing huge deficits with few prospects for cutting, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=227.2s)]
*  which is why Washington State is joining the movement across the country to tax the rich. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=233.08s)]
*  On Tuesday, voters will decide on initiative 1098 that would create an income tax, but [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=239.9s)]
*  only on the wealthy, of whom there are many. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=245.52s)]
*  133,000 millionaires and seven billionaires, including Bill Gates of Microsoft. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=249.28s)]
*  His father, Bill Gates Sr., has poured his own money into backing initiative 1098. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=257.44s)]
*  Some people say initiative 1098 is about soaking the rich. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=263.4s)]
*  The tax would bring in $3 billion a year to be spent mainly on education, which has suffered [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=267.2s)]
*  cutbacks as the state reels under a massive deficit. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=273.12s)]
*  Vote yes on 1098. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=276.96s)]
*  That's good for Washington. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=279.08s)]
*  Washington is one of only seven states without any income tax. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  The proposal would create a 5% rate on income over 200,000 for individuals and 400,000 for [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=285.18s)]
*  couples. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=292.44s)]
*  A 9% rate kicks in at half a million dollars on individuals and a million for couples. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=293.44s)]
*  Let's say a couple earns $500,000. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=300.4s)]
*  How much do you think they'll have to pay? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=304.44s)]
*  Well, they would pay $5,000 because that's 5% of the 100,000 on which they would pay. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=306.08s)]
*  Oh, they would only pay on the 100,000. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=312.84s)]
*  They're exempt up to the 400,000. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=316.0s)]
*  Precisely. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=317.76s)]
*  So they'd only pay on 100,000. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=318.76s)]
*  Precisely. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=320.76s)]
*  Well, it's not very much. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=321.76s)]
*  Precisely. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=323.76s)]
*  If you earn that kind of money. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=324.76s)]
*  Precisely. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=326.2s)]
*  His son Bill is on his side, along with the public employers unions. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=327.4s)]
*  The other side is a who's who of the state's big businesses, Boeing, Amazon, and even Microsoft. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=332.68s)]
*  Bill Gates is still chairman, but the CEO, Steve Bomber, opposes the initiative, which [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  is why they're calling this the Battle of the Billionaires. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=347.16s)]
*  Is it awkward? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=351.36s)]
*  The other word awkward fits, yes. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=352.36s)]
*  Bomber's side argues that the Soak the Rich Tax would stifle high-tech innovation and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=355.12s)]
*  lead to businesses moving out of the state. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=360.4s)]
*  We asked Microsoft, Amazon, and Boeing for interviews, but they all declined. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  Businesses are saying they'll leave. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=369.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  The real truth of the matter is that the people that own businesses are the people who will [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  be paying the tax, and my analysis is they don't want to pay the tax. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  The rich guys don't want to pay the tax. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=382.96s)]
*  Are you saying you just think they're greedy? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  No, because they're defensive. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=389.28s)]
*  I guess you could call it greed, I suppose, wanting to not write another check, sure. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=394.32s)]
*  Steve Bomber, he's worth $14 billion. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  He's a very fine guy, too. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=404.88s)]
*  The fact of the matter is there are 43 states in this country that have a state income tax, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=407.4s)]
*  and in those states, the Microsofts or the ABCs, whatever, have not fled the state. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=413.4s)]
*  I mean, it's just a gross exaggeration. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  But entrepreneur Brian Mistoli begs to disagree. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=423.84s)]
*  This initiative really is a nail in the coffin of small businesses and start-ups in our state. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=427.88s)]
*  It really impacts the tech community very heavily. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=431.32s)]
*  Nail in the coffin. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=433.96s)]
*  You mean kill it off. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=434.96s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  Mistoli is the CEO of Inrix, a software company that monitors traffic around the world and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=437.76000000000005s)]
*  provides data for GPS systems and sites like MapQuest. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  So this is a map of Paris. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=448.12s)]
*  He says businesses would leave the state, especially high-tech companies like his that [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=450.24s)]
*  deal in data and aren't tied down by factories or assembly lines. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=455.36s)]
*  He'd consider moving some of his 60 employees to other states where he has offices. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=460.92s)]
*  What are the states? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=466.84s)]
*  Massachusetts, Florida, California. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=467.84s)]
*  Massachusetts, income tax. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=469.28s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=471.79999999999995s)]
*  California, income tax. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=472.79999999999995s)]
*  Texas, Florida, Michigan, Colorado. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=473.79999999999995s)]
*  Okay, four out of the six have income taxes. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=477.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I've heard a lot of businessmen say what you're saying, and I keep wondering, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=479.88s)]
*  well, where are they going to move if they leave? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=482.96s)]
*  Well, each state has its own competitive advantages. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=485.44s)]
*  So by adding this additional burden, it makes us much less attractive. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=488.44s)]
*  Adam Steitz is another entrepreneur who opposes the initiative. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=491.84s)]
*  Five years ago, he moved his company, iStores, from Portland, Oregon, across the Columbia [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=496.36s)]
*  River to Vancouver, Washington, just nine miles away. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=501.56s)]
*  It broke down to taxes. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=506.32s)]
*  Oregon has the highest income tax in the United States, and Washington has the lowest at zero [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=507.32s)]
*  percent. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=512.24s)]
*  iStores is the largest online retailer of paintball equipment. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=513.24s)]
*  Steitz has been hiring staff for a new company he acquired that sells prank novelties. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=519.6s)]
*  Is this for Halloween? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=525.44s)]
*  It is for Halloween or for any times that you need to be a man-eating shark. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=526.44s)]
*  Under the new tax, he would have to pay $50,000 a year, and that, he says, would hamper his [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=529.48s)]
*  ability to expand any further. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=535.08s)]
*  This money, if it passes, will go specifically to education because they've been cutting [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=538.32s)]
*  schools and things like that. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=544.6400000000001s)]
*  So what is Washington state supposed to do about its schools in terms of revenue? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  I think that the state, in aggregate, needs to take a look at its expenses. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=552.36s)]
*  Like? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=557.32s)]
*  I've had opportunity in Portland to see cars being washed by third-party washing firms [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=558.32s)]
*  cleaning cars on the weekends for state vehicles. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=567.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't have someone who comes and cleans my car in a van and waxes and washes it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=572.12s)]
*  That's in Portland. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=576.32s)]
*  It's in Portland, but I think it's indicative of government spending. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=577.32s)]
*  But the state budget has already been cut by $5 billion, and the governor, Christine [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=579.24s)]
*  Gregoire, says they're at the bone. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=584.44s)]
*  To cut people off hospice, I think, is immoral. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=587.28s)]
*  To cut children off health care, to cut their education so they don't have a chance at a [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=591.32s)]
*  decent future, I think that would result in an immoral budget. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=596.36s)]
*  She says she doesn't understand why so many of the state's high-tech CEOs, who are always [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=600.96s)]
*  complaining about the woeful state of American education, are so opposed to paying this tax [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=606.2s)]
*  for schools. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=612.1600000000001s)]
*  These businesses that want the educated workforce, they're against this. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=613.48s)]
*  What do they say to you when you challenge them on this? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=618.12s)]
*  I tell them. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=621.0s)]
*  I have the utmost respect for them. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=622.0s)]
*  These are great CEOs, and I say to them, here's the problem. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=623.8000000000001s)]
*  You always want us to invest more in education, and now you say no. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=628.12s)]
*  So my question to you, if not this, then what? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=632.08s)]
*  What do they say? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=636.36s)]
*  They don't have an answer, Leslie. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=637.36s)]
*  The initiative was way ahead in the polls until the opposition started airing ads saying [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=639.3s)]
*  1098 is a slippery slope. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=645.18s)]
*  Polls now show the middle class thinks they too will be hit with income taxes. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=650.74s)]
*  And the high-tech entrepreneurs we met say there's a fairness issue. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=655.9s)]
*  Bill Gates got to start Microsoft without an income tax. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=660.14s)]
*  And this is something you hear a lot, that they find it curious Gates is supporting an [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=664.34s)]
*  income tax now. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=668.86s)]
*  I believe the Gateses have already made most of their money, so they wouldn't be taxed [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=671.02s)]
*  under a new income tax structure in our state. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=674.06s)]
*  They wouldn't be taxed at all? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=676.42s)]
*  No. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=678.14s)]
*  Well, for people who have already made their money and paid taxes in the state, that money [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=679.14s)]
*  wouldn't be taxed again. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=682.5s)]
*  It's only for people who are earning new money in this state. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=683.78s)]
*  Bill, that's ridiculous. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=686.18s)]
*  I mean, my son will pay a huge, huge income tax. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=688.02s)]
*  He will? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=693.18s)]
*  And he's the richest man in the country. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=695.0999999999999s)]
*  How can anybody think he isn't going to pay a huge income tax? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=696.5799999999999s)]
*  What is the income? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=700.54s)]
*  What does a person with $50 billion have for income? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=701.54s)]
*  This conversation isn't making any sense. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=705.0999999999999s)]
*  Bill Gates would pay multi-millions in taxes on the income from his investments. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=708.7399999999999s)]
*  He wants to. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=714.78s)]
*  He's told you that. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=715.78s)]
*  He's for this. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=716.78s)]
*  Well, wants to is a little strong. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=717.78s)]
*  He's for this. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=719.62s)]
*  He is for it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=720.62s)]
*  He's very willing. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=721.62s)]
*  But as David Stockman will tell you, that attitude is hard to find. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=723.0600000000001s)]
*  We've demonized taxes. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=727.22s)]
*  All right? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=729.02s)]
*  We've created almost the idea that they're a metaphysical evil. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=730.78s)]
*  Still, he says there should be a one-time 15% surtax on the wealthy that he estimates [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=735.26s)]
*  would cut the national debt in half. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=742.18s)]
*  In 1985, the top 5% of the households, the wealthiest 5%, had net worth of $8 trillion [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=745.18s)]
*  which is a lot. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=753.02s)]
*  Today, after serial bubble after serial bubble, the top 5% have net worth of $40 trillion. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=754.78s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=761.78s)]
*  And top 5% have gained more wealth than the whole human race had created prior to 1980. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=763.58s)]
*  Of course, it would never pass. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=770.58s)]
*  There's the rub. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=772.58s)]
*  There's the rub. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=774.58s)]
*  The antipathy to raising taxes or making any real spending cuts, whether in Washington, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=775.86s)]
*  D.C. or Washington State, is so intense, Stockman despairs that when Congress returns after [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=781.6999999999999s)]
*  the election, they'll do what they often do, nothing. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=788.02s)]
*  I remember that great expression, let's kick the can down the road. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=792.38s)]
*  That became kind of the mantra. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=796.42s)]
*  Yeah, and it still is today. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=797.74s)]
*  Just kick it down the road. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=799.9399999999999s)]
*  We're kicking the can down the road, except it's no longer a can. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=800.9399999999999s)]
*  It's a giant junkyard. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=804.0999999999999s)]
*  Our government is in knots over ways to lower the federal budget deficit. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=811.54s)]
*  Well, what if we told you we found a pot of money, over $60 billion a year, that could [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=832.5799999999999s)]
*  be used to help out? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=838.54s)]
*  That bundle is tax money not coming into the IRS from American corporations. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=840.82s)]
*  One major way they avoid paying the tax man is by parking their profits overseas. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=847.1s)]
*  They'll tell you they're forced to do that because the 35% corporate tax rate is high [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=853.38s)]
*  in relation to other countries. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=858.94s)]
*  And indeed, it seems the tax code actually encourages companies to move businesses out [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=861.22s)]
*  of the country. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=866.44s)]
*  Company searching out tax havens is nothing new. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=868.62s)]
*  In the 80s and 90s, there was an exodus to Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, where there [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=871.98s)]
*  were no taxes at all. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=876.62s)]
*  When President Obama threatened to clamp down on tax dodging, many companies decided to [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=879.02s)]
*  leave the Caribbean. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=884.14s)]
*  But instead of coming back home, they went to safer havens like Switzerland. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=886.02s)]
*  Several of these companies came to this tiny dot on the Swiss map called Zug, a small, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=892.26s)]
*  medieval town. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=898.58s)]
*  I don't think anybody's ever heard of Zug in the United States. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=899.58s)]
*  Hans Marti, who heads Zug's economic development office, showed off the nearby snow-covered [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=902.94s)]
*  mountains. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=908.66s)]
*  But Zug's main selling point isn't a view of the Alps. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=909.78s)]
*  How low are the taxes here? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=913.7s)]
*  It's something between 15 and 16%. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=916.14s)]
*  And in the United States, it's 35%. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=918.14s)]
*  I know. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=921.14s)]
*  It's half price. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=922.14s)]
*  And do you have the lowest tax rate in Switzerland? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=923.7s)]
*  Most probably yes. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=927.38s)]
*  Most probably yes. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=928.38s)]
*  So you're kind of a tax haven within a tax haven. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=929.62s)]
*  Maybe yes. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=933.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=934.86s)]
*  The population of the town of Zug is 26,000. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=935.86s)]
*  The number of companies in the area? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=939.38s)]
*  30,000 and growing, at an average rate of 800 a year. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=941.34s)]
*  But many are no more than mailboxes. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=945.9399999999999s)]
*  Texas Democratic Congressman Lloyd Doggett questions whether the recent moves of several [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=948.86s)]
*  companies are legit. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=953.1s)]
*  A good example is one of my Texas companies that's been in the news lately, TransOcean. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=955.0999999999999s)]
*  TransOcean own the drilling rig involved in the giant BP oil spill. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=960.14s)]
*  They moved to Zug two years ago. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=965.02s)]
*  I'm not sure they even moved that much. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=967.7399999999999s)]
*  They have about 1,300 employees still in the Houston area. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=970.2199999999999s)]
*  They have 12 or 13 in Switzerland. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=974.9399999999999s)]
*  And yet they claim that they're headquartered over there. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=977.2199999999999s)]
*  They claim they're Swiss. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=979.9799999999999s)]
*  And they claim they're Swiss for tax purposes. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=981.68s)]
*  And by doing that, by renouncing their American citizenship, they've saved about $2 billion [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=983.9399999999999s)]
*  in taxes. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=990.22s)]
*  So here we are in Zug. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=991.38s)]
*  We went to find their operations here. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=993.34s)]
*  And we came to see your international headquarters. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=995.66s)]
*  The moment was not here, so... [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=998.3s)]
*  She said her boss wasn't there, and we should call someone halfway around the world. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1002.42s)]
*  In Houston. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1006.98s)]
*  Not here. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1008.48s)]
*  No. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1009.48s)]
*  But this is the headquarters. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1010.48s)]
*  I know. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1011.48s)]
*  And is the CEO here? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1012.48s)]
*  No. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1014.08s)]
*  I mean, normally here? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1015.08s)]
*  No. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1017.08s)]
*  OK. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1018.08s)]
*  Another Texas company that moved here is Weatherford, a $10 billion oil field services firm. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1019.08s)]
*  It still has 2,800 workers in Houston. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1025.24s)]
*  But according to official documents, they are incorporated in Zug in this small building. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1028.3600000000001s)]
*  But there was no Weatherford on the sign outside. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1033.92s)]
*  They found it listed in this thing. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1037.52s)]
*  Weatherford International. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1042.22s)]
*  Here. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1044.22s)]
*  Here's the mailbox. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1045.22s)]
*  But we don't know even where to go. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1046.66s)]
*  There's no listing for the international headquarters of Weatherford. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1049.42s)]
*  So we started knocking on doors. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1054.24s)]
*  Hi. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1056.86s)]
*  We're looking for Weatherford. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1058.98s)]
*  Are they in this building? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1059.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1061.98s)]
*  Here? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1062.98s)]
*  Just a moment please. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1063.98s)]
*  I have to check it. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1064.98s)]
*  OK. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1065.98s)]
*  When we went down to a conference room, they said Weatherford rents for board meetings. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1067.44s)]
*  But Weatherford's Houston office told us they never go there. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1070.98s)]
*  So are these big companies pulling a fast one? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1074.84s)]
*  Well, apparently not. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1077.72s)]
*  Under both Zug and U.S. tax laws, it's perfectly legal to get the low tax rate even without [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1079.64s)]
*  a real presence here. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1086.1s)]
*  But Congressman Doggett wants to change that. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1088.1s)]
*  You have proposed legislation that a company will be taxed not based on where they file [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1091.2s)]
*  some pieces of paper, but where their decision makers, their management actually resides [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1098.8600000000001s)]
*  and makes decisions. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1105.48s)]
*  Let them pay the same way that other Houston-based companies pay. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1107.2s)]
*  And so if they have their management and control there, they ought to be paying here in the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1111.76s)]
*  United States. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1115.52s)]
*  I think it's fair. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1116.52s)]
*  We found that faced with the mere threat of Doggett's legislation, Transocean and Weatherford [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1118.54s)]
*  both recently packed up their top brass and shipped them to Geneva. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1124.0s)]
*  We were told Transocean's top ten executives live around here in the Geneva area and work [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1129.76s)]
*  on the top two floors of this building, everyone from the C.E.O. to the chief financial officer [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1135.08s)]
*  to the vice president of taxes. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1140.44s)]
*  They wouldn't talk to us on camera and neither would Weatherford. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1142.8999999999999s)]
*  They also moved their C.E.O. and C.F.O. to Geneva. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1146.72s)]
*  And so now we're beginning to see a jobs exodus from the U.S. of top management. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1150.78s)]
*  We can't write a law that their lawyers can't get around. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1155.8s)]
*  That's the whole problem here. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1158.8400000000001s)]
*  You're in Congress. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1160.52s)]
*  Why did Congress write these laws that allows this to happen? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1161.94s)]
*  There's been a lot of arm twisting, a lot of effective lobbying here, and some really [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1166.8s)]
*  smart tax lawyers figuring out how to game the system with one shenanigan after another. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1172.06s)]
*  But are they shenanigans or is it the law? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1177.8799999999999s)]
*  I think it was a shenanigan when some of these companies felt so strongly about America that [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1180.96s)]
*  they were announced their American citizenship and began saluting a foreign flag. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1186.98s)]
*  They exploited a provision in our tax laws and moved offshore. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1191.5s)]
*  Lawyers tried to put a stop to that with a law passed in 2004 mandating that any company [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1196.8s)]
*  that wanted to move offshore would still have to pay the 35 percent. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1202.58s)]
*  But because of loopholes in the tax code, companies can substantially lower their taxes [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1207.84s)]
*  by moving chunks of their businesses to their foreign subsidiaries. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1213.4199999999998s)]
*  I think when people hear that all these companies are moving overseas because of taxes, they [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1217.46s)]
*  think that doesn't smell right. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1223.78s)]
*  The question is, does a company have a moral obligation to pay its fair share? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1226.24s)]
*  Swiss tax attorney Thierry Boitel. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1231.8s)]
*  I think many companies in the U.S. would like to keep the jobs in the U.S. if they could. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1234.6000000000001s)]
*  But they also need to keep the shareholders happy. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1239.44s)]
*  And they are in the U.S. in a corporate tax nightmare because it's the highest tax rate [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1241.08s)]
*  in the world. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1247.64s)]
*  With Japan slated to lower its rate in April, the U.S. will soon have the highest corporate [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1248.64s)]
*  tax rate in the developed world. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1254.1399999999999s)]
*  We are dealing with a tax system that is a dinosaur. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1256.6599999999999s)]
*  One CEO who would talk to us is John Chambers, head of Cisco, the giant high-tech company [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1260.36s)]
*  headquartered in San Jose. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1266.8s)]
*  He says our tax rate is insane. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1269.1399999999999s)]
*  It's forcing companies into these maneuvers, especially when many other industrialized [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1271.9599999999998s)]
*  countries, including Canada, are busy lowering their tax rates in order to lure our companies [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1277.02s)]
*  and our jobs away. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1283.2800000000002s)]
*  Every other government in the world has realized that the U.S. has it wrong. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1285.7s)]
*  They're saying I'm going to have lower taxes, period. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1290.64s)]
*  That's what you see across all Western Europe. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1293.44s)]
*  That's what you see in Asia and the developed countries. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1295.44s)]
*  Are you judged as a CEO on things like this, on taxes? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1297.42s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1302.0800000000002s)]
*  He's been expanding Cisco overseas because of growing demand abroad, but also to lower [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1303.16s)]
*  the company's taxes. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1309.0s)]
*  Their average rate over the last three years, just 20 percent. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1310.8s)]
*  Economist Martin Sullivan says it's standard operating procedure for companies like Cisco. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1314.92s)]
*  U.S. multinationals are shifting their research facilities, shifting their manufacturing facilities, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1320.84s)]
*  and shifting some regional headquarters into Switzerland and into Ireland. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1326.6s)]
*  And those are massive numbers of jobs. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1330.66s)]
*  He says Ireland taxes corporations at just a third of the U.S. rate. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1333.84s)]
*  So no wonder the outskirts of Dublin look like Silicon Valley. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1339.04s)]
*  These companies are all but obliged to go abroad. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1343.4s)]
*  Well if you have a 35 percent rate in the United States and, for example, a 12.5 percent [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1346.92s)]
*  rate in Ireland, there's an incentive to move your factory to Ireland. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1352.4s)]
*  Six hundred American companies are in Ireland and they employ 100,000 people. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1357.96s)]
*  Those are jobs that aren't here. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1364.4s)]
*  And they moved to Ireland because of taxes. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1366.8s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1369.3s)]
*  The U.S. Treasury, in effect, is subsidizing investment in Ireland. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1370.3s)]
*  Why isn't everybody in Ireland? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1375.3s)]
*  Almost everybody is in Ireland. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1378.3s)]
*  All the pharmaceutical companies, all the high-tech companies. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1379.94s)]
*  You're stupid if you're not in Ireland. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1383.46s)]
*  We notice that you have an awful lot of companies in Ireland. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1387.02s)]
*  Yes, we do. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1389.86s)]
*  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight companies in Ireland. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1390.86s)]
*  We do what makes sense to the shareholders. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1395.16s)]
*  We go where there are incentives in countries that say we want you here, we're going to [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1396.8400000000001s)]
*  give you tax advantages, we want you to add jobs here, etc. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1400.76s)]

*  An increasingly popular way, particularly pharmaceutical and high-tech companies like [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1410.5200000000002s)]
*  Google avoid paying the 35 percent, is to shift their patents, computer code, pill formulas, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1415.3600000000001s)]

*  My answer is very simply. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1615.3999999999999s)]

*  Few of them are doing it for the salary, and all of them will say they're doing it to serve [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1655.6000000000001s)]
*  the public. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1659.64s)]

*  A year ago, he began working on a book about soft corruption in Washington with a team [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1707.84s)]
*  of eight student researchers who reviewed financial disclosure records. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1713.6s)]
*  The results became a jumping off point for our own story, and we have independently verified [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1718.6s)]
*  the material we've used. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1723.8s)]
*  Swizer says he wanted to know why some congressmen and senators managed to accumulate significant [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1725.9199999999998s)]
*  wealth beyond their salaries and proved particularly adept at buying and selling stocks. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1731.36s)]
*  There are all sorts of forms of honest grafts that congressmen engage in that allow them [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1737.08s)]
*  to become very, very wealthy. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1742.6799999999998s)]

*  For example, insider trading on the stock market. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1751.0s)]
*  If you are a member of congress, those laws are deemed not to apply. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1753.6s)]

*  information or financial services stock. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1927.58s)]
*  However, his financial disclosure form seemed to indicate otherwise. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1930.8999999999999s)]
*  Congress made money trading General Electric stock during the crisis and a third of GE's [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1935.62s)]
*  businesses and financial services. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1940.9399999999998s)]
*  During the health care debate of 2009, members of Congress were trading health care stocks, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1943.1399999999999s)]
*  including House Minority Leader John Boehner, who led the opposition against the so-called [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1948.4599999999998s)]
*  public option, government-funded insurance that would compete with private companies. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1952.9399999999998s)]
*  Just days before the provision was finally killed off, Boehner bought health insurance [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1958.84s)]
*  stocks, all of which went up. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1963.5s)]
*  Now Speaker of the House, Congressman Boehner also declined to be interviewed, so we tracked [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1965.54s)]
*  him down at his weekly press conference. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1970.54s)]
*  Speaker Boehner, you made a number of trades going back to the health care debate. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1973.34s)]
*  You bought some insurance stock. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1978.6599999999999s)]
*  Did you make those trades based on non-public information? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1980.3s)]
*  I have not made any decisions on day-to-day trading activities in my account and haven't [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1983.82s)]
*  for years. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1990.84s)]
*  I do not do it. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1993.14s)]
*  Haven't done it. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1994.5400000000002s)]
*  I wouldn't do it. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1995.5400000000002s)]
*  Later, Boehner's spokesman told us that the health care trades were made by the Speaker's [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=1996.5400000000002s)]
*  financial advisor, who he only consults with about once a year. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2000.3400000000001s)]
*  We need to find out whether they're part of a blind trust or not. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2004.38s)]
*  Peter Schweitzer thinks the timing is suspicious and believes congressional leaders should [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2007.74s)]
*  have their stock funds in blind trusts. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2012.26s)]
*  Whether it's $15,000 or $150,000, the principle in my mind is that it's simply wrong and [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2015.3000000000002s)]
*  it shouldn't take place. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2022.02s)]
*  But there is a long history of self-dealing in Washington and it doesn't always involve [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2023.46s)]
*  stock trades. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2027.78s)]
*  Congressman and senators also seem to have a special knack for land and real estate deals. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2029.98s)]
*  When Illinois Congressman Dennis Hastert became Speaker of the House in 1999, he was worth [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2035.1399999999999s)]
*  a few hundred thousand dollars. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2040.82s)]
*  He left the job eight years later a multimillionaire. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2042.7s)]
*  The road that Hastert wants to build will go through these farm fields right here. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2046.18s)]
*  In 2005, Speaker Hastert got a $207 million federal earmark to build the Prairie Parkway [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2050.46s)]
*  through these corn fields near his home. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2057.3s)]
*  What Jan Straßma and his neighbors didn't know was that Hastert had also bought some [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2060.1s)]
*  land adjacent to where the highway is supposed to go. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2064.66s)]
*  Five months after this earmark went through, he sold that land and made a bundle of money. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2068.66s)]
*  How much? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2073.58s)]
*  Two million dollars. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2074.58s)]
*  What do you think of it? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2075.58s)]
*  It stinks. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2077.7400000000002s)]
*  We stopped by the former speaker's farm to ask him about the land deal, but he was off [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2079.0s)]
*  in Washington where he now works as a lobbyist. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2083.4s)]
*  His office told us that property values in the area began to appreciate even before the [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2086.64s)]
*  earmark and that the Hastert land was several miles from the nearest exit. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2091.8s)]
*  But the same good fortune befell former New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg, who helped steer [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2097.02s)]
*  nearly $70 million in government funds towards redeveloping this defunct Air Force base, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2101.8s)]
*  which he and his brother both had a commercial interest in. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2107.96s)]
*  Gregg has said that he violated no congressional rules. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2111.88s)]
*  It's but one more example of good things happening to powerful members of Congress. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2115.88s)]
*  Another is the access to initial public stock offerings, the opportunity to buy a new stock [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2120.48s)]
*  at insider prices just as it goes on the market. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2125.64s)]
*  They can be incredibly lucrative and hard to get. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2129.2400000000002s)]
*  If you were a senator, Steve, and I gave you $10,000 cash, one or both of us is probably [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2132.44s)]
*  going to go to jail. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2137.8s)]
*  But if I'm a corporate executive and you're a senator and I give you IPO shares in stock [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2139.26s)]
*  and over the course of one day that stock nets you $100,000, that's completely legal. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2144.5600000000004s)]
*  And former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her husband had participated in at least eight [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2151.4s)]
*  IPOs. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2156.1600000000003s)]
*  One of those came in 2008 from Visa, just as a troublesome piece of legislation that [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2157.7400000000002s)]
*  credit card companies began making its way through the House. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2163.52s)]
*  Undisturbed by a potential conflict of interest, the Pelosi's purchased 5,000 shares of Visa [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2167.68s)]
*  at the initial price of $44. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2173.7599999999998s)]
*  Two days later, it was trading at 64. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2176.4s)]
*  The credit card legislation never made it to the floor of the House. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2179.64s)]
*  Congresswoman Pelosi also declined our request for an interview, but agreed to call on us [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2184.08s)]
*  if we attended her news conference. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2188.24s)]
*  Madam Leader, I wanted to ask you why you and your husband back in March of 2008 accepted [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2190.3599999999997s)]
*  and participated in a very large IPO deal from Visa. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2197.52s)]
*  At a time there was major legislation affecting the credit card companies making its way through [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2201.96s)]
*  the House. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2207.48s)]
*  And did you consider that to be a conflict of interest? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2209.48s)]
*  I don't know what your point is of your question. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2213.68s)]
*  Is there some point that you want to make with that? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2217.22s)]
*  Well I guess what I'm asking is do you think it's all right for a speaker to accept a very [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2220.22s)]
*  preferential favorable stock deal? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2227.22s)]
*  Well we didn't. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2229.74s)]
*  You participated in the IPO. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2230.74s)]
*  Well I have many investments. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2231.74s)]
*  And at the time you were Speaker of the House, you don't think it was a conflict of interest [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2232.74s)]
*  or had the appearance of a conflict of interest? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2235.74s)]
*  No, it only has appearance if you decide that you're going to have a, elaborate on a false [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2237.74s)]
*  premise. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2242.8999999999996s)]
*  But it's not true and that's that. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2244.02s)]
*  I don't understand what part's not true. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2247.06s)]
*  Yes sir. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2249.2599999999998s)]
*  That I would act upon an investment. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2250.2599999999998s)]
*  Congresswoman Pelosi pointed out that the tough credit card legislation eventually passed, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2254.2999999999997s)]
*  but it was two years later and was initiated in the Senate. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2259.2599999999998s)]
*  I will hold my record in terms of fighting the credit card companies as a Speaker of [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2262.5s)]
*  the House or as a member of Congress up against anyone's. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2267.22s)]
*  Corporate executives, members of the executive branch and all federal judges are subject [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2271.82s)]
*  to strict conflict of interest rules, but not the people who write the laws. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2276.54s)]
*  If you are a member of Congress and you sit on the defense committee, you are free to [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2281.42s)]
*  trade defense stock as much as you want to. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2286.46s)]
*  If you're on the Senate banking committee, you can trade bank stock as much as you want [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2288.88s)]
*  and that regularly goes on in all these committees. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2293.46s)]
*  There should only be one thing in your mind when you're drafting legislation. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2297.3s)]
*  Is this good for the United States of America? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2301.62s)]
*  That's it. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2303.98s)]
*  You're starting to say to yourself, how's this going to affect my investments? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2304.98s)]
*  You've got a mixed agenda and a mixed purpose for being there. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2311.42s)]
*  Brian Baird is a former congressman from Washington State who served six terms in the House before [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2314.46s)]
*  retiring last year. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2319.78s)]
*  He spent half of those 12 years trying to get his colleagues to prohibit insider trading [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2321.78s)]
*  in Congress and establish some rules governing conflicts of interest. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2326.36s)]
*  One line in a bill in Congress can be worth millions and millions of dollars. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2330.98s)]
*  There was one night we had a late, late night caucus and you could kind of tell how a vote [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2334.78s)]
*  was going to go the next day. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2339.26s)]
*  And I literally walked home and I thought, man, if you went online and made us some significant [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2340.6200000000003s)]
*  trades you could make a lot of money on this. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2345.82s)]
*  You could just see it. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2348.84s)]
*  You could see the potential here. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2349.84s)]
*  So in 2004 Baird and Congresswoman Louise Slaughter introduced the Stock Act, which [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2351.5800000000004s)]
*  would make it illegal for members of Congress to trade stocks on non-public information [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2357.34s)]
*  and require them to report their stock trades every 90 days instead of once a year. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2362.38s)]
*  How far did you get with this? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2367.6600000000003s)]
*  Not that we didn't get anywhere. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2368.6600000000003s)]
*  Just flat died. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2369.94s)]
*  Went nowhere. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2371.9s)]
*  How many cosponsors did you get? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2372.94s)]
*  I think we got six. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2373.94s)]
*  Six doesn't sound like a very big amount. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2375.94s)]
*  It's not, Steve. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2377.82s)]
*  You could have national cherry pie week and get a hundred cosponsors. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2379.9s)]
*  When Baird finally managed to get a congressional hearing on the Stock Act, almost no one showed [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2385.02s)]

*  congressmen who had ever heard of it. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2395.54s)]
*  Have you ever heard of the Stock Act? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2397.46s)]
*  The what? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2399.3399999999997s)]
*  The Stock Act. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2400.3399999999997s)]
*  Do you know anything about it? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2401.3399999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2402.3399999999997s)]
*  Congressman? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2403.3399999999997s)]
*  Congressman? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2404.3399999999997s)]
*  I haven't heard about that one yet. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2405.3399999999997s)]
*  Have you ever heard of something called the Stock Act? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2406.9399999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2409.2999999999997s)]
*  I've heard about it, but I can't say it's an issue I spent a lot of time on. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2410.2999999999997s)]
*  I would have no problem with that. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2414.2999999999997s)]
*  But then again, I'm a big fan of instant disclosure on almost everything. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2416.38s)]
*  They're looking for cosponsors. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2421.5s)]
*  And yet I've never heard of it. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2423.54s)]
*  When you have a bill like this that makes so much sense and you can't get the cosponsorships, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2425.54s)]
*  you can't get the leadership to move it, it gets tremendously frustrating. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2430.94s)]
*  Set aside that it's the right thing to do, it's good politics. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2436.1400000000003s)]
*  People want their congress to function well. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2440.56s)]
*  The... [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2443.58s)]
*  It still baffles me. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2447.62s)]
*  But what baffles Baird even more is that the situation has gotten worse. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2449.2599999999998s)]
*  In the past few years, a whole new totally unregulated $100 million industry has grown [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2453.86s)]
*  up in Washington called political intelligence. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2459.24s)]
*  It employs former congressmen and former staffers to scour the halls of the Capitol, gathering [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2462.86s)]
*  public information, then selling it to hedge funds and traders on Wall Street who can trade [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2469.06s)]
*  on it. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2474.34s)]
*  Now if you're a political intel guy and you get that information long before it's public, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2475.46s)]
*  long before somebody wakes up the next morning and reads or watches the television or whatever, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2481.38s)]
*  you've got it. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2486.62s)]
*  And you can make real-time trades before anybody else. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2487.66s)]
*  Baird says it's taken what would be a criminal enterprise anyplace else in the country and [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2490.86s)]
*  turned it into a profitable business model. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2495.5s)]
*  The town is all about people saying, what do you know that I don't know? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2498.42s)]
*  This is the currency of Washington, D.C. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2503.5s)]
*  And it's that kind of informational currency that translates it to real currency. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2506.06s)]
*  Maybe it's over drinks, maybe somebody picks up a phone and says, you know, just to let [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2510.3s)]
*  you know, it's in the bill. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2515.56s)]
*  Trades happen, can't trace them. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2517.26s)]
*  If you can trace them, it's not illegal. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2519.7s)]
*  It's a pretty great system. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2521.22s)]
*  You feel like an idiot to not take advantage of it. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2526.02s)]
*  The American public has a low opinion of Congress. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2528.18s)]
*  Only 14 percent think it's doing a good job. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2555.5s)]
*  But Congress has excelled in one way, raising money. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2558.9s)]
*  Members of Congress raised more than a billion dollars for their 2014 election. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2563.3s)]
*  And they never stop. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2568.22s)]
*  Nearly every day, they spend hours on the phone asking supporters and even total strangers [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2569.74s)]
*  for campaign donations, hours spent away from the jobs they were elected to do. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2575.6s)]
*  The pressure on candidates to raise money has ratcheted up since the Supreme Court's [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2581.78s)]
*  Citizens United decision in 2010. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2586.42s)]
*  That allowed unlimited spending by corporations, unions and individuals in elections. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2589.96s)]
*  So our attention was caught by a proposal from a Republican congressman that would stop [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2595.6000000000004s)]
*  members of Congress from dialing for dollars. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2601.0600000000004s)]
*  Given what it costs to get elected today, it's either a courageous act, a campaign [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2604.5400000000004s)]
*  employ or political suicide. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2609.22s)]
*  Tonight is not about claiming victory. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2611.62s)]
*  Tonight is about committing to service. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2617.2599999999998s)]
*  Florida Republican David Jolly won a special election to Congress in March 2014. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2619.4199999999996s)]
*  Facing a reelection bid that November, he was happy to get a lesson in fundraising from [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2625.8199999999997s)]
*  a member of his party's leadership. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2630.8199999999997s)]
*  But he was surprised by what he learned. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2633.2599999999998s)]
*  We sat behind closed doors at one of the party headquartered back rooms in front of [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2635.98s)]
*  a whiteboard where the equation was drawn out. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2640.28s)]
*  You have six months until the election. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2643.58s)]
*  Break that down to having to raise $2 million in the next six months and your job, new member [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2645.58s)]
*  of Congress, is to raise $18,000 a day. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2650.34s)]
*  Your first responsibility is to make sure you hit $18,000 a day. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2654.02s)]
*  Your first responsibility as a congressman? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2657.98s)]
*  As a city member of Congress. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2660.54s)]
*  How are you supposed to raise $18,000 a day? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2661.94s)]
*  Simply by calling people, cold calling a list that fundraisers put in front of you. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2665.42s)]
*  You're presented with their biography. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2670.1s)]
*  So please call John. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2672.1800000000003s)]
*  He's married to Sally. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2673.58s)]
*  His daughter Emma just graduated from high school. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2675.02s)]
*  They gave $18,000 last year to different candidates. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2677.66s)]
*  They can give you $1,000 too if you ask them to. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2681.12s)]
*  And they put you on the phone. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2684.34s)]
*  And it's a script. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2685.9s)]
*  There are actually scripts for calls. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2687.82s)]
*  We got our hands on one distributed by the National Republican Congressional Committee [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2691.42s)]
*  to help GOP members invite donors to attend their annual fundraising dinner in March. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2695.94s)]
*  It has this useful diagram. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2702.26s)]
*  If the donor answers the phone, the caller should plug the unique opportunity to come [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2704.9s)]
*  together with House Republican leadership. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2710.2400000000002s)]
*  If they get turned down, they should remind the donor that the NRCC did a great deal to [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2713.1400000000003s)]
*  help maintain the majority in 2014. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2718.74s)]
*  And if they get a yes, there's even an instruction for the caller to pause and let the donor [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2723.06s)]
*  speak. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2728.66s)]
*  It must have worked. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2730.2599999999998s)]
*  That NRCC dinner raised more than $20 million, breaking records. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2731.9399999999996s)]
*  It was attended by members of Congress, major donors and lobbyists, including this man who [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2737.7s)]
*  was not too happy to see our camera crew. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2743.8199999999997s)]
*  But one successful fundraiser does not let Congress members off the hook. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2748.66s)]
*  The phone calls asking for money never stop. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2753.3399999999997s)]
*  House schedule is actually arranged in some ways around fundraising. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2756.94s)]
*  You're telling me the whole schedule of how work gets done is scheduled around fundraising? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2760.58s)]
*  That's right. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2765.98s)]
*  You never see a committee working through lunch because those are your fundraising times. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2766.98s)]
*  And then in between afternoon votes and evening votes, that's when you can see Democrats walking [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2771.02s)]
*  down this street, Republicans walking down that street to spend time on the phone making [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2774.98s)]
*  phone calls. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2780.02s)]
*  By law, members of Congress cannot make fundraising calls from their offices. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2781.02s)]
*  So both parties have set up call centers just a few blocks away. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2786.3s)]
*  This is where the Republicans have theirs. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2791.34s)]
*  So can I go in there? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2794.06s)]
*  I don't think they would let either one of us in here at this point. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2795.22s)]
*  Remember, I stopped paying my dues. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2797.62s)]
*  What Jolly means is that in addition to raising money for their own campaigns, members are [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2799.54s)]
*  supposed to raise thousands of dollars for their parties. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2804.94s)]
*  That's their dues. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2808.86s)]
*  If Republican members don't pay up, they can't use the party's call suites. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2810.26s)]
*  No photos exist of the inside of either the Democratic or Republican centers. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2815.78s)]
*  But with the help of a staffer, we were able to get into the Republican center with a hidden [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2821.34s)]
*  camera. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2826.94s)]
*  About a dozen tiny offices equipped with a phone and computer line a corridor. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2828.26s)]
*  This is where members of Congress sit behind closed doors and plow through lists of donors, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2833.9s)]
*  dialing for dollars. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2840.54s)]
*  Outside in the main hallway is a big board where the amount each member has raised for [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2843.0s)]
*  the party is posted for all to see and compare. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2847.6800000000003s)]
*  It is a cult-like boiler room on Capitol Hill where sitting members of Congress, frankly, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2852.32s)]
*  I believe are compromising the dignity of the office they hold by sitting in these sweatshop [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2857.0s)]
*  phone booths calling people asking them for money. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2861.9s)]
*  And their only goal is to get $500 or $1,000 or $2,000 out of the person on the other end [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2864.7400000000002s)]
*  of the line. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2869.94s)]
*  It's shameful. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2870.94s)]
*  It's beneath the dignity of the office that our voters and our communities entrust us [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2871.94s)]
*  to serve. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2876.6800000000003s)]
*  But you may not have a job if you don't fundraise. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2877.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm willing to take that risk. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2880.98s)]
*  A risk because David Jolly has pledged to stop personally asking donors for money. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2883.1000000000004s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2888.9s)]
*  In February, he introduced a bill called the STOP Act that would ban all federal elected [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2890.3s)]
*  officials from directly soliciting donations. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2895.86s)]
*  But Congressman, with all due respect, stopping members of Congress from making phone calls [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2899.38s)]
*  is not going to fix the entire system. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2902.5s)]
*  Certainly not. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2905.1000000000004s)]
*  It's not comprehensive campaign finance reform. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2906.1000000000004s)]
*  It is not. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2908.04s)]
*  This is congressional reform. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2909.04s)]
*  It very simply says members of Congress spend too much time raising money and not enough [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2910.5800000000004s)]
*  time doing their job. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2916.02s)]
*  Get back to work and do your job. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2918.46s)]
*  The STOP Act would still allow members of Congress to attend fundraisers. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2920.9s)]
*  Others could still ask for donations on their behalf. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2926.02s)]
*  Republican Congressman Reed Ribble has signed on as a co-sponsor of the STOP Act. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2929.78s)]
*  After six years in Washington, he's going home to Wisconsin at the end of this term. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2934.86s)]
*  You've spent your life running a commercial roofing company. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2940.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2943.78s)]
*  When you came to Congress and heard how much you have to raise to keep getting re-elected, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2944.78s)]
*  did you want to quit? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2951.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2952.7400000000002s)]
*  Are you the only one who feels that way? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2953.7400000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2956.1400000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2957.1400000000003s)]
*  If members would be candid, there's a lot of frustration centered around it. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2958.1400000000003s)]
*  And some of this is the result of Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision that opened [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2963.02s)]
*  up really corporate dollars into the system. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2967.7400000000002s)]
*  And so if you want to have your own voice, if you want your voice to be heard as opposed [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2971.22s)]
*  to some outside group speaking for you, you better do your job and raise enough money [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2975.4199999999996s)]
*  that you can. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2979.74s)]
*  After the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, a flood of outside money poured [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2980.74s)]
*  into super PACs, political groups which are allowed to spend unlimited dollars on ads [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2986.74s)]
*  to support or attack candidates for office. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2993.02s)]
*  The last few years of Congress have been the most unproductive ever. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=2996.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3001.18s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3002.18s)]
*  I didn't hardly recognize the place when I came back. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3003.18s)]
*  Congressman Rick Nolan, a Democrat from Minnesota, is also co-sponsoring the STOP Act. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3006.8599999999997s)]
*  Nolan was first elected to Congress in 1974 but served just six years. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3012.7s)]
*  He returned in 2013. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3017.8599999999997s)]
*  You see, like I took a nap and I came back and I said, wow, what happened to this place? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3019.42s)]
*  What's happened to democracy? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3024.98s)]
*  I mean, the Congress of the United States has hardly become a Democratic institution [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3026.38s)]
*  anymore. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3029.7s)]
*  Why? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3030.7s)]
*  Well, because of all the money in politics, in my judgment. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3031.7s)]
*  What has your party said about how members of Congress should raise money? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3035.22s)]
*  Well, both parties have told newly elected members of the Congress that they should spend [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3039.34s)]
*  30 hours a week in the Republican and Democratic call centers across the street from the Congress, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3044.14s)]
*  dialing for dollars. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3048.86s)]
*  30 hours a week? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3049.86s)]
*  30 hours is what they tell you you should spend. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3050.86s)]
*  It's discouraging good people from running for public office. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3053.7s)]
*  I could give you names of people who said, you know, I'd like to go to Washington and [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3057.14s)]
*  help fix problems, but I don't want to go to Washington and become a mid-level telemarketer, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3061.54s)]
*  dialing for dollars, for crying out loud. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3067.94s)]
*  You're saying members of Congress are becoming like telemarketers? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3069.9s)]
*  Well, 30 hours a week. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3072.7799999999997s)]
*  That's a lot of telemarketing, probably more than most telemarketers do. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3074.66s)]
*  The Republican House campaign committee would not tell us whether it recommends a specific [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3079.92s)]
*  amount of call time. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3084.7400000000002s)]
*  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee claims it currently does not. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3086.56s)]
*  But in 2013, at an orientation meeting, new Democratic members were shown a model schedule. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3091.48s)]
*  It was later published by the Huffington Post. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3098.9s)]
*  It suggested representatives should spend four hours a day on call time and just two [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3102.08s)]
*  hours a day on the business of Congress, committee meetings, and time on the House [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3107.52s)]
*  floor. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3112.16s)]
*  The man in charge of the Democratic campaign committee at the time was Congressman Steve [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3113.32s)]
*  Israel, a Democrat from New York. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3118.04s)]
*  That's more time calling and asking for money than constituent work or floor work in Congress. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3121.16s)]
*  Very frustrating. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3128.44s)]
*  That's what your message was, though, to other lawmakers. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3129.44s)]
*  spend more time raising money than working on your constituents' needs or being on the [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3132.32s)]
*  floor of the Congress. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3138.6800000000003s)]
*  Very frustrating. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3141.04s)]
*  The result of a system that is broken, the result of a system that allows unlimited amounts [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3142.2200000000003s)]
*  of money to be spent against you. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3147.96s)]
*  Before Citizens United, about how many hours a day would you have to spend on the phone [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3150.6800000000003s)]
*  raising money? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3154.56s)]
*  I have to put in about an hour, maybe an hour and a half, at most two hours a day, into [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3155.56s)]
*  fundraising. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3160.44s)]
*  And that's the way it went until 2010, when Citizens United was enacted. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3161.56s)]
*  At that point, everything changed. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3166.16s)]
*  And I had to increase that to two, three, sometimes four hours a day, depending on what [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3168.2000000000003s)]
*  was happening in the schedule. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3173.2000000000003s)]
*  Israel revealed he spent more than 4,000 hours on the phone soliciting donations. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3175.4s)]
*  It's something he won't miss when he leaves Congress at the end of this term. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3181.7400000000002s)]
*  Still, he doesn't support the STOP Act. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3185.92s)]
*  Do you applaud Congressman Jolly for at least trying to do something on this issue? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3189.68s)]
*  Look, I'm glad that Congressman Jolly is focusing attention on the issue. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3193.48s)]
*  I'd rather focus solutions on the issue. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3198.32s)]
*  And if I believe that his bill was really going to be meaningful, was going to take [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3201.2799999999997s)]
*  money out of politics, I'd support it in a second. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3204.54s)]
*  But it really doesn't. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3208.0s)]
*  If you ask me to make an assessment as to the prospects of passage, one being the president [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3209.08s)]
*  should get ready to sign it, and five being it's dead on arrival, I'd put it at a 15. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3216.16s)]
*  It's not going to pass. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3221.92s)]
*  I urge you, while you are here, before retiring and lamenting the amount of time you spent [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3223.3999999999996s)]
*  raising money, co-sponsor the STOP Act. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3229.2799999999997s)]
*  Despite Jolly's repeated pleas on the House floor to his colleagues, only six are supporting [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3233.3599999999997s)]
*  his bill. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3239.08s)]
*  Why do you just have a handful of supporters for this act? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3240.08s)]
*  I think people are scared to death of their own re-election. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3243.88s)]
*  There's a lot of people who will see me coming and break eye contact. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3247.88s)]
*  They don't want to talk about it. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3251.84s)]
*  Isn't this just a convenient way for you to campaign as an outsider? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3253.6000000000004s)]
*  Is it politically appealing? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3258.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3260.84s)]
*  But that doesn't make it wrong. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3261.84s)]
*  Jolly is now running for the Florida Senate seat, being vacated by Marco Rubio. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3265.44s)]
*  It's a race that could determine whether Republicans hold on to control of the Senate. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3270.72s)]
*  We caught up with Jolly at a Blue Jays spring training game in his Florida district. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3275.7999999999997s)]
*  How much is it going to cost to win the Senate seat? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3281.04s)]
*  Boy, some say $100 million, statewide. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3283.8799999999997s)]
*  $100 million? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3286.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3287.68s)]
*  So how can you raise that money if you are not going to make any phone calls? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3289.64s)]
*  We have a robust campaign team that can make phone calls, that can organize events, that [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3292.9599999999996s)]
*  many resources as we can possibly raise as a campaign team. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3298.4s)]
*  At the moment, Jolly's leading most polls against his Republican primary opponents, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3302.4s)]
*  but he's lagging in fundraising. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3307.4s)]
*  And that makes his pledge to stop asking for donations look like quite a gamble. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3309.68s)]
*  So what happens if you have not raised enough money and it's the last week of the campaign [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3315.2s)]
*  and a super PAC dumps in millions of dollars that might be distorting your record? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3319.7999999999997s)]
*  At the end of the day, if you tell me that the only way to be a United States senator [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3325.24s)]
*  is to raise $100 million in Florida, then I'm not the next United States senator from [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cnT1MUu8Y&t=3328.28s)]
