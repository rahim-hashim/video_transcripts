**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA)
*  What would you do if America was invaded by a foreign army? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=0.0s)]
*  If you weren't among the dead and wounded, would you join the refugees or the resistance? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=13.08s)]
*  Tonight, meet the Ukrainian civilians who chose to fight for freedom behind enemy lines. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  The army didn't want me because I am a woman, but I insisted and convinced them I could help. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=28.32s)]
*  I think growing up here gave me an enormous appreciation for the world. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=38.2s)]
*  This rancher and Republican governor unsurprisingly stands by big coal, but he surprised us on [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=42.88s)]
*  just about everything else he believes around energy policy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  So you tell the people of Wyoming that climate change is real? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=53.32s)]
*  I do. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  And that it's urgent. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  It's an urgent crisis. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  I have said that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  And I've gotten some pushback from that as well. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  I bet you have. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=65.72s)]
*  Can you do this? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=70.72s)]
*  How about this? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  Novak Djokovic can, and that's why he's the greatest champion in the history of men's tennis. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  He clearly wanted to leave his mark on this interview, too. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=85.68s)]
*  Mental strength, which is what I think is your great gift, is much harder to articulate. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=89.28s)]
*  Can you help us explain? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=94.72s)]
*  I have to correct you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=95.72s)]
*  I have to correct you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=96.72s)]
*  It's not a gift. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=97.72s)]
*  It's something that comes with work. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=98.72s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=102.44s)]

*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=110.76s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=112.36s)]
*  Tonight, 35 million victims of Russian aggression have a new reason to worry. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=124.36s)]
*  This past Wednesday, the U.S. Senate defeated billions in aid for Ukraine. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=130.92s)]
*  The bill included relief for Israel and the U.S.-Mexico border, but Republicans wanted [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=136.86s)]
*  more on immigration. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=142.46s)]
*  The Senate's likely to try again. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  The White House says Ukraine's support will run out in weeks. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=146.58s)]
*  Ukraine has asked the West for a lot of money, but not a drop of blood. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  Its people are doing the fighting. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=156.82000000000002s)]
*  Even civilians who chose not to flee but stay behind Russian lines and join the resistance. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=159.06s)]
*  They include a wedding planner, an office worker, and retirees who pledged their lives, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=167.46s)]
*  their fortunes, and their sacred honor to defend the free world from tyranny. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=173.66s)]
*  In February 2022, nearly 200,000 Russians invaded, and Ukrainian civilians heard the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  call to arms. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=194.1s)]
*  Olga Hrychenko went straight to enlist in the army. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=198.42s)]
*  They didn't want me because I'm a woman, she said, but I insisted and convinced them I could help. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=204.9s)]
*  The wedding planner, Vitaly, organized his civilian friends to fight. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=211.9s)]
*  We jammed two cars full of weapons and we went to defend our city. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=218.62s)]
*  And 62-year-old Boris Solenkov came out of retirement to defend his country. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=224.46s)]
*  I told myself, no, I won't flee. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=231.46s)]
*  This is my land. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=234.5s)]
*  This is my region. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  Their region is Herson, a southern province with a capital of the same name on the Dnieper [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  River. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=245.66s)]
*  On March 2, 2022, Russia's surprise attack overwhelmed the city. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=246.7s)]
*  The government of Herson surrendered, but the people rebelled. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=252.9s)]
*  Armed with flags, civilians confronted Russian tear gas and bullets. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=260.46s)]
*  In secret camps, volunteers organized an underground force to harass the invaders, while others [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=267.17999999999995s)]
*  gathered windowsill intelligence to upload to the Ukrainian military. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=275.17999999999995s)]
*  To hear the story of how Herson rose up, we had to head down. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=281.88s)]
*  The Russians were one mile from here firing artillery, so we assembled a studio in a bunker. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=287.24s)]
*  Here we met Vitaly, who asked to go by his first name. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=295.12s)]
*  He recruited 10 friends, including a coffee shop owner and a farmer. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=299.72s)]
*  Most had never loaded a gun. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=305.14s)]
*  He told us, that was our team. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  Different people, different in age and social status, just like that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=311.64s)]
*  Ukrainians. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=317.44s)]
*  His team of civilians improvised this base near the river. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=320.52s)]
*  They ran hit-and-run raids, including, Vitaly says, an attack on a small Russian boat. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=325.0s)]
*  We killed all of them on the boat. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  A major, a captain, two lieutenants, a senior sergeant and a soldier. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  Help an American audience understand why you feel so strongly about protecting this country [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=344.24s)]
*  and these people. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  The Russians came to our home. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=357.48s)]
*  Someone at the top decided that they could come to your home, tell you how to live your [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=361.64000000000004s)]
*  rape your wife, kill your child, smash your fields with tanks and lay mines. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=367.44s)]
*  You are bloody savages. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=374.52s)]
*  No more, no less. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  Why defend my people? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=380.24s)]
*  I was brought up this way. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=382.32s)]
*  Boris Selenkov was also brought up that way. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=385.24s)]
*  He's a retired politician and former governor of the province. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=389.0s)]
*  In my country house, he told us, I had gasoline and oil for my car. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=395.04s)]
*  And so following a recipe, we made Molotov cocktails in bottles. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  He told us those cocktails went down the hatch of a Russian armored vehicle like this. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  This is Selenkov, who fought with a civilian team and ate food set out by villagers. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  He says that one night he was ambushed and shot. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=421.22s)]
*  I saw my leg and muscles were torn, but not the bone. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=428.06s)]
*  When I took the body armor off, my chest was covered in bruises as a result of two bullets [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=432.98s)]
*  that hit the body armor. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  Selenkov told us he escaped and treated his leg. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=441.46000000000004s)]
*  I heated my knife and with a stick between my teeth, I cut off all the muscles that were [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=446.5s)]
*  loose on my leg. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=452.18s)]
*  I stitched the wound up as best I could in the dark with no anesthetic. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=454.5s)]
*  I knew that if I surrendered, they would torture me to death. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=461.68s)]
*  Torture sets the price of freedom nearly beyond reach. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=467.58s)]
*  Like Selenkov, this couple was burning armored vehicles and collecting weapons until they [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=472.7s)]
*  were betrayed by traitors collaborating with Russia. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=478.7s)]
*  After you were arrested, the Russians tried to get you to give up the names of other members [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=483.53999999999996s)]
*  of the resistance. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=489.34s)]
*  And I wonder what the Russians did to you to try to get that information. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=492.02s)]
*  The pair asked not to be identified. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=497.64s)]
*  You'll understand why. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=500.98s)]
*  Shall we tell you everything? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=504.74s)]
*  He asked. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=506.58000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=507.58000000000004s)]
*  What they have to tell about Russian torture is hard to bear, but it should be heard. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=508.98s)]
*  They poured vodka down my throat. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=517.82s)]
*  They said we'll pour a liter of vodka into you and you will tell us everything. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=520.22s)]
*  He said. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=525.98s)]
*  They burned her legs with boiling water. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=527.14s)]
*  They put a gun to my eyes and said, I'm going to shoot you. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=531.74s)]
*  I wanted him to shoot me. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=535.74s)]
*  I wanted it to happen quickly, not to be tortured. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=537.34s)]
*  I was only thinking about my children so that the Russians don't get a hold of them. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=541.7s)]
*  I only thought about my children. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=547.1800000000001s)]
*  He told us they twisted my arms behind my back and started pushing them in opposite [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  directions, almost breaking them. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=557.04s)]
*  Then they let me go. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=562.64s)]
*  And about 30 minutes later, they took me upstairs again. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=564.56s)]
*  He told us the Russians tortured him with electric shock from an army field telephone [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=582.0s)]
*  like this. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=587.52s)]
*  It has a crank that generates electricity. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=589.16s)]
*  When they brought me in again, they took my trousers off. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=595.0s)]
*  They attached the clips to my genitals and my lip and while they were setting up the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=598.68s)]
*  wires, they were trying to take my tooth out with pliers. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=603.4s)]
*  They would say to me, let's call Biden or Zelensky. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=613.48s)]
*  You choose. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=617.0s)]
*  Biden was when they attached the clips to my genitals and lip and when they clipped [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=618.4399999999999s)]
*  to my ear and toe, that's when we called Zelensky. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=623.8s)]
*  That's how they joke when they torture people. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=627.92s)]
*  You did not give up the names. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=631.6800000000001s)]
*  And I wonder why you chose to suffer so much. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=636.0s)]
*  Because they're young guys. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=644.88s)]
*  They have families, children. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=646.72s)]
*  And I am Ukrainian. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=649.08s)]
*  I just couldn't. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=650.6s)]
*  The Russians released them after finding no evidence. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=654.36s)]
*  They had had their phones wiped clean often to leave no clues and no leads. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=658.22s)]
*  While many fought in the underground, 34-year-old Olha Hurenchenko and 66-year-old Kostantin [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=666.78s)]
*  Kozak volunteered for the army. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=673.58s)]
*  They were among the overnight soldiers who threw on uniforms too new for insignia, picked [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=676.62s)]
*  up weapons short of ammunition and with no training faced elite Russian paratroopers. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=683.22s)]
*  Olha told us, when the Russians started shooting from heavy caliber weapons, it turned into [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=690.22s)]
*  a complete nightmare because there was lots of smoke, fire everywhere around. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=698.1800000000001s)]
*  Our interview with Olha was one of those that was interrupted by the distant rumble of a [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=705.5400000000001s)]
*  Russian shell exploding in the city. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=711.18s)]
*  Why were you there the day? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=713.8199999999999s)]
*  Oh, there go the Russians again. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=715.78s)]
*  When you hear explosions like that in the city, what do you think? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=718.9399999999999s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=725.6999999999999s)]
*  We live one day at a time today. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=726.96s)]
*  We don't have any plans for the future. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=729.46s)]
*  We understand that we have to be strong and patient and live in this reality we have now. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=731.9s)]
*  That's it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=741.0200000000001s)]
*  Kostantin told us about Lilac Park in Herson, where the overnight soldiers tried to make [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=742.26s)]
*  a stand. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=749.14s)]
*  He said, on video you can see people who died and you can see them lying there, weapons [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=750.58s)]
*  next to them, a horrible situation because people were torn apart, the trees were torn [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=758.6800000000001s)]
*  apart. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=765.38s)]
*  Twenty-eight volunteers were killed in the Lilac Park massacre. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=767.6999999999999s)]
*  They never stood a chance. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=774.18s)]
*  They knew that. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=775.98s)]
*  But they were all that stood between the Russians and their families. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=777.62s)]
*  Citizens of Herson, who gave the last full measure of their devotion, looked to their [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=784.9s)]
*  city from a hill. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=790.26s)]
*  The Battle of Herson would ultimately be their victory over the arrogance of the Kremlin. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=792.38s)]
*  Vladimir Putin said that Herson would be Russian forever. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=799.62s)]
*  He did not know that the Ukrainian forces outside the city and the resistance fighting [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=804.54s)]
*  within would never let up. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=810.06s)]
*  We don't know how many Ukrainians were killed, but the fresh graves in this Herson cemetery [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=814.12s)]
*  testify to the Russian occupation. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=820.48s)]
*  It lasted about eight months until the Russians could no longer hang on. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=824.1800000000001s)]
*  A year ago, the Russians retreated across the river from Herson city. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=830.36s)]
*  But still, civilians continued to suffer under the Russian roulette of artillery rounds. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=836.3000000000001s)]
*  And while we were there, a shell hit this building and riddled a city bus. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=843.32s)]
*  Two passengers were wounded, a policeman was killed. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=849.06s)]
*  Today, Russia still occupies nearly 20 percent of Ukraine. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=853.3599999999999s)]
*  And so the resistance continues. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=859.3s)]
*  Of those we spoke to in the bunker, the man who suffered so much has now joined the army. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=863.8199999999999s)]
*  She is back in civilian life, as is Olha Heranchenko. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=871.5799999999999s)]
*  Boris Solenkov tried to enlist, but the army told him at 62, he's too old. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=876.7s)]
*  Vitaly is now in the special forces and had one last thing to say. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=885.0200000000001s)]
*  When misfortune came, it was America that offered help to my country. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=892.1s)]
*  The USA and Great Britain were the first countries who came and offered their shoulder, giving [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=897.1400000000001s)]
*  us a chance at the very start to take a deep breath in order to regroup. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=903.16s)]
*  So thank you to all Americans from Ukraine. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=909.02s)]
*  Representatives from nearly every nation have met this week at an annual climate summit [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=925.8s)]
*  searching for agreements on how to curb the rise of global temperatures. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=930.28s)]
*  The summit is being held in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates, and that has dismayed activists [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=934.86s)]
*  who believe that the only way to really address the climate crisis is to walk away from fossil [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=940.88s)]
*  fuels. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=946.16s)]
*  For the moment, at least, the world and the United States need both fossil fuels and renewable [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=947.52s)]
*  energy, and the best proof of that may be found in the state of Wyoming. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=953.26s)]
*  This is the country's leading coal-producing state and very conservative politically, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=958.54s)]
*  yet its Republican governor, Mark Gordon, is emerging as a leading voice promoting climate-friendly [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=963.62s)]
*  energy projects and action to address the climate crisis. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=970.06s)]
*  Essentially, Mark Gordon is trying to prove that it is possible to be both red and green. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=974.3399999999999s)]
*  We needed to be aggressive and we needed to really address this issue. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=982.4599999999999s)]
*  You tell the people of Wyoming that climate change is real. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=987.86s)]
*  I do. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=993.0200000000001s)]
*  And that it's urgent. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=994.3000000000001s)]
*  It's an urgent crisis. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=995.3000000000001s)]
*  I have said that. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=996.3000000000001s)]
*  And I've gotten some pushback from that as well. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=997.3000000000001s)]
*  I bet you have. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1000.9000000000001s)]
*  In September, we met Mark Gordon, who's in the middle of his second term as Wyoming's [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1003.9000000000001s)]
*  governor, on the cattle ranch where he grew up. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1008.1800000000001s)]
*  This is my dad's old saddle. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1012.0200000000001s)]
*  His family still owns this ranch, and he and his wife also operate another about 40 miles [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1015.14s)]
*  away. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1021.18s)]
*  How did growing up here affect your world view? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1022.34s)]
*  I think growing up here gave me an enormous appreciation for the world around us and the [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1026.7s)]
*  ecological processes and the weather. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1033.94s)]
*  You just are exposed to it on a regular basis. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1036.26s)]
*  Mark Gordon is also a mountain climber who has seen glaciers receding due to a warming [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1041.58s)]
*  climate. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1047.02s)]
*  He says that helped convince him to set a goal of making Wyoming not just carbon neutral [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1048.1s)]
*  when it comes to CO2 emissions, but eventually carbon negative. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1053.98s)]
*  You first made this pledge of net negative CO2 emissions at a 2021 state of the state [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1059.1799999999998s)]
*  speech. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1066.74s)]
*  How did that go over? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1068.22s)]
*  I think some people probably resented it. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1069.58s)]
*  I think generally it's been well respected. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1072.82s)]
*  It was to some degree a bold move and one that was intended to make a difference in [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1076.6599999999999s)]
*  that discussion about energy in the future. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1084.06s)]
*  After Gordon repeated his net negative emissions goal at an appearance at Harvard in October, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1087.28s)]
*  Wyoming's Republican Party passed a vote of no confidence in him. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1093.74s)]
*  He says heat from the right won't deter him from pursuing what he calls an all of the [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1098.1799999999998s)]
*  above energy policy. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1103.46s)]
*  Whatever you're going to do in energy, probably you're going to have something to do in Wyoming. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1106.98s)]
*  We have tremendous wind resources. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1111.24s)]
*  We have the largest reserves of uranium, important for nuclear energy, largest coal producer, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1113.1399999999999s)]
*  number eight in oil, number nine in natural gas. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1120.26s)]
*  83% of our energy is exported. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1123.34s)]
*  That will soon include nuclear power from a next generation reactor to be built in Wyoming [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1126.34s)]
*  with a $500 million investment from Bill Gates. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1132.26s)]
*  Huge wind farms already dot Wyoming's landscape with the biggest one yet on the way. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1136.8999999999999s)]
*  Because the wind blows basically 24-7, 365 days a year. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1144.02s)]
*  Bill Miller is president of the Power Company of Wyoming, which is beginning to build what [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1149.34s)]
*  will be the largest wind farm in the continental United States in the middle of a geographic [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1154.26s)]
*  break in the continental divide. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1160.34s)]
*  All the winds which blow from west to east pretty much are funneled through this part [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1163.02s)]
*  of the country. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1168.22s)]
*  Miller drove to the top of a place called Choke Cherry Knob to give us a taste of the [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1170.02s)]
*  wind. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1176.14s)]
*  So when this is up and running, how many turbines will be out here? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1177.58s)]
*  Our plan calls for 600 turbines. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1183.2s)]
*  And how much energy will that generate? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1185.72s)]
*  They'll generate around 12 million megawatt hours of power a year. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1187.56s)]
*  And that's enough to power how many homes? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1192.0s)]
*  Million, million two. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1194.6000000000001s)]
*  Wyoming doesn't have anything close to that many homes. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1197.04s)]
*  It has the smallest population of any of the 50 states. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1200.44s)]
*  So the plan is to build a new 800-mile long transmission line to send that power to California, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1204.2s)]
*  which needs and wants it. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1211.32s)]
*  What's this going to cost? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1213.76s)]
*  The wind farm will be something north of $5 billion. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1215.4399999999998s)]
*  Transmission line will be something north of $3 billion capital investment. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1219.36s)]
*  That's a big investment. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1222.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1224.72s)]
*  The project is bankrolled by billionaire Philip Anschutz, who owns the company Bill Miller [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1225.72s)]
*  runs and who first made his fortune in oil. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1230.9199999999998s)]
*  Society has spoken. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1236.1599999999999s)]
*  That's what this country is going to go to, is renewable energy. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1237.16s)]
*  More importantly, it's a project that contributes to the zero carbon initiatives that we strongly [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1241.5600000000002s)]
*  believe in. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1246.92s)]
*  It's going to happen. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1248.16s)]

*  17. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1484.08s)]
*  Why so long? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1485.08s)]
*  Primarily the permitting process, the bureaucracy of the federal government. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1487.76s)]
*  You told me coming up here that the process was kind of like a nightmare. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1491.2s)]
*  It was difficult. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1495.96s)]

*  I think it's massive. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1509.96s)]
*  Permitting reform, I think, is one of our biggest challenges at a federal level. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1511.72s)]
*  It is something that's being embraced by both sides. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1515.8s)]

*  permitting for energy projects. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1525.6399999999999s)]

*  In Wyoming, Governor Gordon has done what he can. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1531.0s)]
*  One thing I can share is that it's a state that's very welcoming to innovators in the [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1535.3999999999999s)]

*  About five years ago, it decided to tackle the problem of flaring when gas produced at [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1545.7199999999998s)]
*  oil wells is simply burned into the atmosphere. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1551.32s)]
*  If you could capture it all, it would power about two-thirds of Europe's electricity. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1554.8s)]
*  It's a very large amount of waste. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1558.48s)]
*  And we're just burning it off? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1560.04s)]
*  We're burning it off because there's no pipeline there. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1561.04s)]
*  Cavness and his colleagues came up with the unconventional idea of putting a small electricity-generating [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1563.56s)]
*  power plant right where that gas was being flared and wasted. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1569.94s)]
*  What we do is we tap into that gas line. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1575.02s)]
*  We bring the gas over to a power generation system, and then that generates electricity. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1576.7800000000002s)]
*  And we take that electricity directly into our on-site data center to power hundreds [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1582.14s)]
*  or thousands of computers. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1586.3600000000001s)]
*  And then we network the computers to the outside world with fiber or satellite internet to [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1588.5s)]
*  get it off-site. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1592.94s)]
*  So you take a data center and just basically put it on top of the wellhead? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1593.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1599.22s)]
*  It's a modern data center in every way when you're standing inside of it. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1600.22s)]
*  And then you step out the door and you're in an oil field. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1604.1399999999999s)]
*  Crusoe Energy first used those electricity-gobbling data centers to mine Bitcoin. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1607.8999999999999s)]
*  Now most of that computer power is being used by artificial intelligence companies. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1613.98s)]
*  The first place to let them try this in 2018 was Wyoming. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1619.62s)]
*  That's not necessarily an idea that everyone's going to embrace automatically right off the [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1625.1799999999998s)]
*  bat before it's been done before. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1628.46s)]
*  Wyoming was. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1629.98s)]
*  They invited us to come do it for the first time here. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1630.98s)]
*  We did it at a small scale. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1633.46s)]
*  We proved that it could work. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1634.66s)]
*  And that helped us attract the funding and the other projects that have helped us scale [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1636.46s)]
*  to where we are today. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1640.8000000000002s)]
*  How many of these centers do you have up and running currently? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1641.98s)]
*  We're approaching 200 by the end of the year. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1646.38s)]
*  We'll have about 200 of our modular data centers deployed throughout the United States and [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1648.3400000000001s)]
*  now internationally. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1652.52s)]
*  So how do you assess your environmental impact? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1654.26s)]
*  So today we're operating at a scale of more than 20 million cubic feet of gas per day [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1657.94s)]
*  that would have otherwise been flared and wasted. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1661.94s)]
*  We're preventing that flaring. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1664.42s)]
*  It's on the order of several hundred thousand cars per year being taken off the road in [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1665.88s)]

*  key to his staggering success. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1763.74s)]
*  Forget speed or strength, flexibility enables him to perform feats like this. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1767.66s)]

*  But, yeah, I think the young guys were very hungry and very inspired to play their best [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1802.18s)]
*  tennis against me. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1808.6200000000001s)]
*  It's an additional motivation. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1809.6200000000001s)]
*  I think they kind of awaken a beast in me. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1810.98s)]
*  Djokovic is no longer chasing records, he's creating them. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1815.18s)]
*  His stubborn habit of winning major titles started in 2008, and it's gone on, and on, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1819.5s)]
*  half of his 24 coming after he turned 30, most recently last September's U.S. Open. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1827.02s)]
*  He says that he may not be as fast as he once was, but he's wiser and more accurate. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1834.58s)]
*  Give us a sense of the size of the target you're aiming for. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1840.5s)]
*  Like this, a little coin. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1849.9s)]
*  At times, yes. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1852.66s)]
*  You're being serious. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1853.66s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1854.66s)]
*  At times, I'm aiming for this size, sometimes I'm aiming for this size. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1855.66s)]
*  It depends on the moment of the match, who am I playing against, what the tactic is. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1861.34s)]
*  He's now looking for another part of his tactics, looking for any hint of weakness across the net. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1868.26s)]
*  Even though there's no physical contact in tennis, there's still a lot of eye contact [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1873.26s)]
*  when we're changing ends, when we're sitting on the bench, and then the big screen shows [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1878.82s)]
*  him how he drinks his water, and then I'm looking at him, how is he drinking water, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1884.58s)]
*  is he sweating more than usual, is he breathing? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1888.22s)]
*  You're kicking all of a sudden during a match. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1891.14s)]
*  Exactly, is he breathing deeply or not deeply, and then I look how he's communicating with [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1892.9s)]
*  his team. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1896.3s)]
*  You have all these different elements that are in play that really affect the performance [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1897.6599999999999s)]
*  in the game itself. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1904.1799999999998s)]
*  Can I tell you what one of the hardest things about covering you is, people understand big [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1905.5s)]
*  muscles and speed and grace, mental strength, which is what I think is your great gift, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1910.1799999999998s)]
*  is much harder to articulate. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1916.4199999999998s)]
*  Can you help us explain? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1918.1s)]
*  I have to correct you. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1919.1s)]
*  I have to correct you. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1920.1s)]
*  It's not a gift. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1921.1s)]
*  It's something that comes with work. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1922.1s)]
*  You train for the mental side the way you would your serve or your forehand. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1923.9399999999998s)]
*  Your forehand, how? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1927.14s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1928.14s)]
*  Well, there are different techniques. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1929.14s)]
*  Conscious breathing is a big part, especially in the moments when you're under tension. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1931.3s)]
*  I think a lot of people think, oh, in the moment Novak's so locked in, you're saying [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1935.98s)]
*  this is all part of a process. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1939.78s)]
*  I might appear maybe locked in, but trust me, there's a storm inside, and the biggest [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1942.42s)]
*  always battle is within, right? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1948.22s)]
*  Take us in there. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1950.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you have your doubts and fears. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1951.6200000000001s)]
*  I feel it every single match. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1953.38s)]
*  I don't like this kind of a mindset that I see a lot in sports. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1955.42s)]
*  Just think positive thoughts, be optimistic. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1959.54s)]
*  There is no room for failure. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1961.7s)]
*  There is no room for doubts and stuff like this. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1963.78s)]
*  It's impossible to do that. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1968.0600000000002s)]
*  You don't buy that. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1969.0600000000002s)]
*  You are a human being. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1970.0600000000002s)]
*  The difference, I guess, between the guys who are able to be biggest champions and the [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1971.0600000000002s)]
*  ones that are struggling to get to the highest level is the ability to not stay in those [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1977.22s)]
*  emotions for too long. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1984.26s)]
*  So for me, it's really relatively short, so as soon as I experience it, I acknowledge [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1985.7s)]
*  it. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1990.78s)]
*  I maybe burst, I scream on the court, whatever happens, but then I'm able to bounce back [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1991.78s)]
*  and reset. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1997.46s)]
*  Some days you win and you're the better player. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=1998.8200000000002s)]
*  You're more precise, you're more powerful. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2000.8200000000002s)]
*  Other times, you are just better mentally. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2002.42s)]
*  That happened in 2019 when I played finals of Wimbledon, that marathon match, epic match [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2005.48s)]
*  with Roger. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2011.7s)]
*  He had two match points on his serve. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2012.78s)]
*  I remember that very well. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2015.18s)]
*  Fifth and decisive set, Wimbledon's center court, historically pivotal match, crowd squarely [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2019.18s)]
*  with Roger Federer, who stood one point from victory. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2025.02s)]
*  Djokovic stayed alive with cold-blooded shots like this. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2029.3s)]
*  I beat him 13-12 in the fifth set. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2036.3799999999999s)]
*  The sets that I won were all won in tie breaks, 7-6, 7-6, 13-12. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2038.78s)]
*  And overall, if you see stats, he was far better player in every aspect, but I won the [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2048.14s)]
*  match. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2052.98s)]
*  And so that actually tells you that you can still win if you pick and choose in which [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2053.98s)]
*  moments of the match you're picking and you're playing your best when it matters. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2058.9s)]
*  At the outset of his career, Djokovic couldn't break through against Federer and Nadal. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2064.02s)]
*  He was the third wheel. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2069.82s)]
*  And he now admits he felt intimidated by them before big matches. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2071.78s)]
*  I'm playing Nadal in Roland Garrison. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2076.74s)]
*  I have his locker next to my locker. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2078.38s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2080.78s)]
*  So we are so close. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2081.78s)]
*  And we're trying to give each other space, but then locker room is also not that big. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2082.88s)]
*  And the way you jump around like Nadal does, before we go out on the court in the locker [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2087.46s)]
*  room, he's doing sprints next to you. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2092.2999999999997s)]
*  I can even hear the music he's listening to, you know, in his headphones. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2093.98s)]
*  So you know, it's pissing me off. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2098.14s)]
*  So way before you hit the first ball, this competition started. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2099.46s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2102.98s)]
*  Early in my career, I didn't realize how all that's part of the scenario, right? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2103.98s)]
*  So I was getting intimidated by that. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2107.2999999999997s)]
*  But it's also motivating me to do stuff myself and to show that I'm ready. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2109.18s)]
*  You know, I'm ready for battles, for a war. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2112.98s)]
*  If Djokovic has now surpassed his rivals on scoreboards and in record books, he is aware [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2115.62s)]
*  that he's never quite matched their soaring popularity. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2120.64s)]
*  The amount of pressure and stress is so much higher if you have crowd against you. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2124.56s)]
*  Home game versus road game. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2129.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2131.92s)]
*  But most of my career, it was mostly hostile environments for me. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2133.04s)]
*  I kind of learned how to thrive in that environment. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2137.7999999999997s)]
*  And people think that it's actually better if they don't like me so that it kind of gets [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2140.44s)]
*  the best out of me in terms of tennis. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2145.64s)]
*  It did happen, but at the same time, I actually enjoy more being in an environment where, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2148.56s)]
*  you know, I have nice, nice support. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2153.72s)]
*  Djokovic is open about this, too. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2157.32s)]
*  He sometimes struggles with, how to put it, impulse control. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2160.68s)]
*  Your tennis is so precise and crisp. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2166.24s)]
*  How do you handle it when you make these sort of errors and lapses when you break a racket [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2169.88s)]
*  or when your emotions get the better of you? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2175.52s)]
*  Well, look, you know, I have broken rackets in my life, you know, no doubt about it. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2177.72s)]
*  And I'm not proud about that. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2182.08s)]
*  And I'm ashamed of myself when I do that, no doubt. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2185.0s)]
*  But at the same time, you know, I accept myself as a flawed human being. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2188.12s)]
*  Djokovic found controversy of a larger scale in early 2022. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2194.0s)]
*  Unvaccinated, he got an exemption to play the Australian Open at a time when the country [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2198.96s)]
*  was coming out of a long COVID lockdown. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2203.72s)]
*  But after public outcry, Djokovic was deported, making for a global news event. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2207.96s)]
*  How much of a toll did that whole controversy take on you? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2213.6000000000004s)]
*  It did. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2216.98s)]
*  I was basically declared as a villain of the world, you know, and... [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2217.98s)]
*  You said so. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2221.1400000000003s)]
*  Of course. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2222.1400000000003s)]
*  And I had basically, yeah, most of the world against me. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2223.1400000000003s)]
*  I had that kind of experience on the tennis court with crowds that were not maybe chewing [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2227.42s)]
*  me on, but I never had this particular experience before in my life. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2233.02s)]
*  Did you misread the Australian public and what the reaction would be? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2237.62s)]
*  I mean, which way did I misread them? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2241.22s)]
*  They don't like exceptionalism. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2242.82s)]
*  This was a culture that felt very strongly about vaccinations. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2244.18s)]
*  But the point is that it was not up to me to read anybody. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2247.18s)]
*  I got the exemption, I got the permission to come into the country. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2250.46s)]
*  And so, of course, it escalated to the highest of the highest levels globally. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2253.54s)]
*  Craig, if I'm wrong, you were not against vaccination. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2258.62s)]
*  You just did not want it for yourself. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2261.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2262.74s)]
*  People tried to, you know, declare me as an anti-vax. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2263.74s)]
*  I'm not anti-vax. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2268.62s)]
*  No, I'm pro-vax. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2269.62s)]
*  I'm pro-freedom to choose. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2270.62s)]
*  There are so many dimensions to Djokovic. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2275.4599999999996s)]
*  He may polarize, but he is remarkably accessible. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2277.8199999999997s)]
*  He may be tennis' apex predator, but is exceedingly popular among his prey, that is, with other [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2282.16s)]
*  players. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2288.58s)]
*  He's won more money than any tennis player in history, yet co-founded a players' association [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2289.7s)]
*  designed largely to ease the financial burden of pro tennis' rank and file. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2295.22s)]
*  You understand how extraordinary this is. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2301.2799999999997s)]
*  We talk about in tennis, you say, eat what you kill. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2304.06s)]
*  Well, you're helping the others eat, who are the same folks that want to take food off [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2306.1s)]
*  your table. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2310.46s)]
*  Well, because I have plenty. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2311.46s)]
*  You know, I have much more than what I need. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2312.46s)]
*  But women and men who are around 200 and lower ranked in the world, they are struggling [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2314.9s)]
*  a lot. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2322.2200000000003s)]
*  They can't afford a coach, they can't afford to travel, they skip tournaments. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2323.2200000000003s)]
*  Many of them leave tennis, who are super talented and maybe capable of reaching great heights [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2326.3s)]
*  and successes, but they just can't make it. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2330.62s)]
*  Coming from a small country and meager beans himself, Djokovic knows this better than anyone. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2334.58s)]
*  When he returned to Serbia in September after winning the U.S. Open, 20,000 fans greeted [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2341.42s)]
*  him. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2346.98s)]
*  He was overcome by it all. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2347.98s)]
*  During our visit to Belgrade last month, we noticed the prominence of the conquering hero [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2354.08s)]
*  and the speculation about where his popularity might take him next. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2359.4s)]
*  Pretty obvious, you're going to be the leader of this country one day. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2364.78s)]
*  What kind of a leader are you going to be? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2368.44s)]
*  How do you know? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2370.8599999999997s)]
*  You're making some kind of claims here that I'm not even aware of. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2371.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm seeing your popularity here. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2375.94s)]
*  You will have an easier time at the ballot box here than you will winning in Australia. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2378.14s)]
*  You've done that 10 times. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2381.9s)]
*  I love how you are phrasing and formulating this question. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2382.9s)]
*  The way you do it is so, you know, well, I do not have any political inspirations at [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2387.06s)]
*  the moment. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2393.7s)]
*  I don't feel that this is a world or an environment where I would thrive, but I do think that [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2394.7s)]
*  my popularity in the country and in the region can be used for some other things where I [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2403.5s)]
*  can help contribute to life and society. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2411.18s)]
*  Specifically, he and his wife Jelena have a foundation, and this goes way beyond your [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2415.18s)]
*  philanthropy that's built or renovated more than 50 Serbian preschools and counting. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2420.7s)]
*  As for their own children, Stefan, age nine, and Tara, age six, they play a role in their [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2426.7s)]
*  father's tennis longevity. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2432.18s)]
*  Is the fact that your kids are old enough not just to watch you play, but to really [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2434.62s)]
*  appreciate what dad's doing out there, is that a reason to keep playing? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2437.74s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2441.7s)]
*  Actually years ago I had a dream that my daughter and my son will be able to watch me win Wimbledon [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2443.3399999999997s)]
*  Trophy, so that happened several times. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2449.66s)]
*  I was very fortunate to experience that. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2451.46s)]
*  Maybe the ultimate career extender? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2453.98s)]
*  A new rival to continue stoking his fire. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2455.5s)]
*  Spain's Carlos Alcaraz, age 20, the only player to beat Djokovic at a major this year. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2462.5s)]
*  He's as complete of a player as I have seen in ages. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2468.4199999999996s)]
*  I'm about to theory off you. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2472.2599999999998s)]
*  It was a disappointing day for you, but in a way this was energizing that you had this [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2473.5s)]
*  young challenger. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2480.1s)]
*  Yes, absolutely it was. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2481.1s)]
*  And you're right, because that pissed me off so much that I needed to win everything on [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2483.06s)]
*  American soil, which I did. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2488.66s)]
*  It's a great opportunity for me to reinvent myself and really push harder than I ever [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2493.9s)]
*  did. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2499.5s)]
*  Covering Djokovic's rise to the top. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2505.06s)]
*  I really belong here. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2507.58s)]
*  I belong at the top of Man's tennis. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2509.54s)]
*  At 60minutesovertime.com [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2511.7799999999997s)]
*  Tonight, as the northern hemisphere slips deeper into the darkest days of the year, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2513.7799999999997s)]
*  Christians observe the second Sunday of the Advent season, while Jews celebrate the fourth [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2525.66s)]
*  evening of Hanukkah. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2529.74s)]
*  Both are marked by lighting candles against the oncoming dark, a time of watchful waiting, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2531.3s)]
*  of anticipation, and of overcoming oppression. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2537.6200000000003s)]
*  This year in particular, the darkness seems deeper. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2541.42s)]
*  It's visible on the faces of innocent citizens in Ukraine, Gaza, Israel, and other places [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2544.86s)]
*  on the globe. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2553.5s)]
*  In these darkening days, lighting a candle, or several candles, may be more than a symbol [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2555.1000000000004s)]
*  of brighter days to come. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2560.54s)]
*  It may be an act of faith in an uncertain future. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2562.58s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv45JcECGAA&t=2567.02s)]
