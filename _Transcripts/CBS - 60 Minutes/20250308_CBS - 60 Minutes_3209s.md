**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0)
*  Last year, for the first time, the Veterans Administration announced it would begin funding [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=0.0s)]
*  its own clinical trials to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and addiction [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=16.32s)]
*  using two psychedelic drugs, psilocybin and MDMA. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=22.0s)]
*  Even if these trials are successful, it would be years before the VA could prescribe either [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=26.56s)]
*  drug for its patients. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Thousands of Veterans who are suffering aren't waiting. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=32.92s)]
*  Desperate for help, they're attending psychedelic retreats in countries where the drugs are [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=36.12s)]
*  legal to use, mostly in indigenous ceremonies. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=40.6s)]
*  This past March, we were invited to join nine Veterans who traveled to the west coast of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=44.7s)]
*  Mexico for a psychedelic journey they hoped would finally help ease their pain. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=49.22s)]
*  They came to Mexico from all over the United States, a group of nine Veterans with invisible [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=56.48s)]
*  wounds that are hard to heal. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=62.0s)]
*  Their destination, a remote village near Puerto Vallarta for a week-long psychedelic retreat. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  It was a voyage into the unknown, but a risk worth taking for TJ Duff, a former Navy sailor. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=70.72s)]
*  Are you optimistic? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=77.16s)]
*  Being optimistic is hard for me because I've been through a lot of therapy, a lot of different [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=79.4s)]
*  treatments and not a lot of success. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=84.92s)]
*  Duff was 18 when he joined the Navy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  Months into his first deployment aboard the USS Cole, he says he narrowly escaped death [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=90.64s)]
*  when two suicide bombers attacked the ship in Yemen, killing 17 sailors. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=96.16s)]
*  Everyone around me was killed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=101.6s)]
*  There's bodies alive and dead being piled up in the midships and I think that's really [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=103.16s)]
*  where I just started holding everything in. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  I don't have it where I'm jumping in ditches when I hear loud noises. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=110.88s)]
*  My PTSD is kind of a self-destructive form. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  Randy Weaver is a police officer in New York. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  A former staff sergeant in the Army, he was diagnosed with PTSD in 2007 after returning [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=123.28s)]
*  home from tours in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  It's the constant, you know, what if I hadn't done this? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=133.32s)]
*  What if we did that? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=136.32s)]
*  Are those things you want to revisit while you're taking the psilocybin? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=138.16s)]
*  Yeah, if I could revisit them and see them maybe from a different perspective, like not [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=142.56s)]
*  where I failed somebody. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=150.4s)]
*  Is there a particular incident that you feel you failed somebody? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=152.2s)]
*  Yeah, so March 18th, 20 years ago. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=159.4s)]
*  In 2004, Weaver's platoon was caught in a firefight in an Afghan village. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=164.36s)]
*  Two soldiers were killed, one of them his friend, Staff Sergeant Anthony Lagman. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=169.24s)]
*  Weaver's worn this bracelet with Lagman's name on it since coming home. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  You've been wearing that for 20 years? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=177.96s)]
*  Yeah, every day. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=180.0s)]
*  Weaver says he's tried nearly every treatment for PTSD the VA offers, including talk therapy, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  exposure therapy, meditation and antidepressants. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=187.68s)]
*  You get to a point where you're so mentally exhausted and you've created so much destruction [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=191.68s)]
*  that your demons tell yourself that your family would be better off without you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=199.0s)]
*  And when those demons tell you those things every day, it's something hard to ignore. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=206.52s)]
*  Will this help with that? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=211.28s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=213.12s)]
*  The retreat was organized and paid for by the Heroic Hearts Project, a nonprofit that's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=214.68s)]
*  helped more than a thousand U.S. veterans with combat-related PTSD access psychedelics. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=219.8s)]
*  I came home super angry, super anxious, hypervigilant. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=225.56s)]
*  That led to a pretty nasty divorce. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=230.28s)]
*  Ed Glover was in Afghanistan with the Marines. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=232.4s)]
*  He's been a firefighter for 22 years. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=235.24s)]
*  I feel like one or two traumatic events you may be able to recover from, but seeing it [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  day in, day out, it really takes its toll. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  As the vets talked, it became clear some of their struggles began long before they [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=246.12s)]
*  joined the military. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=250.96s)]
*  My family life was just always this constant conflict. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=252.24s)]
*  Navy vet Michael Giardina had an emotionally abusive father who killed himself 16 years [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=254.76s)]
*  ago. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=259.88s)]
*  His sister died by suicide five months before he came here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=260.88s)]
*  My daughter asked my ex-wife if I was going to kill myself. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=264.4s)]
*  And I'm not. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=267.0s)]
*  I just want to get better. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=268.0s)]
*  To qualify for this retreat, they had to work with their doctors to wean off any antidepressant [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=270.12s)]
*  or anxiety medication they might be taking because of how it could interact with the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=274.96s)]
*  psychedelics. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  They also had to have a medical screening and no family history of psychosis or schizophrenia. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  When we were there, a local doctor was on site, but no mental health professionals. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=286.52s)]
*  I appreciate you guys for putting the faith in me, the faith in us coming here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  Jesse Gould, a former Army Ranger, founded the Heroic Hearts Project in 2017 after he [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  tried another psychedelic, ayahuasca, at a retreat in Peru. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=302.8s)]
*  Gould says psychedelics can help veterans revisit traumatic moments in ways they may [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=307.24s)]
*  be unable to with other therapies. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=311.88s)]
*  The value of what we're finding with psychedelics is it's a very individualistic journey. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=314.2s)]
*  It comes at you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=319.44s)]
*  It brings up the emotions. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=320.44s)]
*  It heightens your senses. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=321.44s)]
*  And so you're having to face it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=322.44s)]
*  So that's why you see such big revelations because it's giving you the tools to actually [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=324.48s)]
*  get there. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=328.86s)]
*  Some who see this as sort of the last hope may end up disappointed. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=330.5s)]
*  I worry that we're at the situation where people are having to go to other countries [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=333.5s)]
*  for their last hope. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=337.38s)]
*  That indicates a major flaw in the system. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  The orange one? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=341.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=342.94s)]
*  Heroic Hearts hired traditional healers to conduct three psychedelic ceremonies. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=343.94s)]
*  The first two with psilocybin, a psychoactive compound found in some mushrooms. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=348.64s)]
*  It's been used as medicine by indigenous communities in Mexico and elsewhere for centuries. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=353.82s)]
*  You don't need to be strong. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=359.6s)]
*  All we need for this experience and to receive the healing is humbleness. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=362.44s)]
*  The healers stirred ground-up mushrooms into a tea. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=371.04s)]
*  The vets drank it, put on blindfolds to shut out distractions and lay down. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=376.72s)]
*  At first it seemed like the group might have traveled thousands of miles for a midday [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=383.92s)]
*  nap. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  But then, about an hour in, we saw Michael Giardina raise his hand for help. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  His foot soon started to shake, followed by his whole body. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=401.86s)]
*  By hour three, it was clear the psilocybin had kicked in. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=414.72s)]
*  Randy Weaver and TJ Duff barely seemed to move, while firefighter Ed Glover appeared [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=420.44s)]
*  caught between rapture and deep sorrow. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  Five hours later, when the psilocybin began to wear off, the vets removed their eye masks [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=441.76s)]
*  and found the heat of the afternoon sun. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=446.8s)]
*  The next day, the group gathered to discuss what they'd gone through. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=451.28s)]
*  It literally felt like an exorcism. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=454.48s)]
*  My foot was going crazy. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=456.8s)]
*  I could kind of feel like my body was convulsing. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=459.24s)]
*  I felt like I was taking every last breath of any victim, patient or friend that I had [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=461.84s)]
*  lost. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=467.44s)]
*  So I really struggled to breathe yesterday. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=468.44s)]
*  I've never done anything like that before. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=470.32s)]
*  Randy Weaver appeared to find some of what he traveled all this way for. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=473.48s)]
*  One thing that I remember very vividly was flying back with the guys that we lost. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=478.04s)]
*  Like being on that medevac, even though I wasn't there in the real world, I was there [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=493.2s)]
*  spiritually with them. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=497.88s)]
*  TJ Duff, however, found it unsettling and at times scary. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=501.36s)]
*  I've heard a lot of your guys' stories and I did not get as immersive as you guys did. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=504.68s)]
*  I'm kind of glad I didn't, honestly, because I was kind of afraid of that. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=508.84s)]
*  That night, Duff took part in another psilocybin ceremony, but the next day he left. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=512.8s)]
*  He later told us the whole experience caused a dangerous decline in his mental health. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=518.36s)]
*  He's now back on antidepressant medication. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=523.04s)]
*  The last ceremony of the retreat was with five MEO DMT, a powerful and fast-acting psychedelic [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=526.36s)]
*  secreted from a toad. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=533.2s)]
*  After returning home, the vets had several virtual meetings with a heroic hearts project [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=535.6600000000001s)]
*  counselor. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=540.44s)]
*  I think my biggest takeaway was making sure I make the time to take care of myself. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=541.44s)]
*  The Veterans Administration warns against self-medicating with psychedelics or using [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=548.96s)]
*  them as part of a self-treatment program. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=553.92s)]
*  But in December, when we spoke to its top doctor, Sharif El-Mahal, he was enthusiastic [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=557.04s)]
*  about their potential. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=561.9599999999999s)]
*  Do these retreats concern you? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=563.76s)]
*  They can concern me because there's no way to monitor, certify, make sure that they're [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=565.8s)]
*  actually safe environments. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=571.24s)]
*  They're seeking these therapies because they do not see our current options for them to [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=572.76s)]
*  be effective enough and they're in a state of desperation. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=577.12s)]
*  And that in and of itself, them seeking this type of unauthorized therapy, is just another [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=580.44s)]
*  indication on why we need to study this further and get it to a safe and effective medical [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=586.0s)]
*  environment. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=590.4s)]
*  In August, the FDA rejected a pharmaceutical company's application to use the psychedelic [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=591.4s)]
*  MDMA in combination with therapy as a treatment for PTSD after an FDA advisory panel said [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=597.04s)]
*  there wasn't enough evidence it was safe or effective. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=603.6s)]
*  The VA is now conducting nine clinical trials using MDMA and psilocybin to treat PTSD, depression [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=607.48s)]
*  and addiction. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=614.44s)]
*  Dr. El-Mahal told us a small Phase II trial by the VA using MDMA and therapy to treat [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=615.44s)]
*  PTSD, completed last year, showed real promise. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=622.12s)]
*  Forty-five percent have gone into complete remission, which is essentially a normal emotional [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=626.72s)]
*  state that is unheard of with prolonged exposure, cognitive processing and certainly SSRIs, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=631.3s)]
*  the current standard of care options. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=637.78s)]
*  Almost half of the people who came in with PTSD and did MDMA therapy at the VA were cured? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=639.6999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=647.0999999999999s)]
*  So you have no doubt that this works? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=648.0999999999999s)]
*  We need to do larger Phase III clinical trials. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=649.8599999999999s)]
*  That's the best way scientifically to understand what the true adverse events are and whether [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=653.02s)]
*  we can reproduce these results in larger populations of veterans. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=659.38s)]
*  I'm very optimistic we will be able to demonstrate that. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=663.18s)]
*  How long do you think it will be before veterans can go to the VA and get this therapy? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=666.16s)]
*  It could be another couple of years. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=672.1s)]
*  The incoming administration is going to take a pretty bold stance on this. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=673.74s)]
*  What makes you optimistic that the new administration is going to be a believer in this? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=678.3s)]
*  We've heard the nominee for HHS, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., talk about what he thinks the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=683.66s)]
*  potential breakthrough therapy is. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=688.92s)]
*  We'll see what the stance is of other health officials. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=691.3s)]
*  That's really promising. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=694.26s)]
*  Nearly a year after that retreat in Mexico, we checked in with the nine veterans who attended. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=696.26s)]
*  Eight of them told us their symptoms have improved and called their experience with [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=701.54s)]
*  psychedelics life-changing. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=705.9599999999999s)]
*  Ed Glover says he still feels like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=708.78s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=713.26s)]
*  Very well. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=714.68s)]
*  Shortly after coming home from the retreat, he decided to retire as a firefighter. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=715.68s)]
*  Prior to the retreat, I thought about taking my life just about every day. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=720.14s)]
*  I had a very close call. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=723.7s)]
*  The note, the gun, that is no longer the case. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=725.98s)]
*  You haven't had thoughts of killing yourself since then? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=729.58s)]
*  Not one. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=732.74s)]
*  And Randy Weaver says his suicidal ideations have stopped as well. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=733.74s)]
*  I don't have any of those thoughts since going through this journey. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=738.62s)]
*  That's remarkable. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=745.34s)]
*  I would say, yeah. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=747.76s)]
*  You had told the group afterward that you had visualized people on a medevac helicopter [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=749.36s)]
*  that you had served with. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=758.5600000000001s)]
*  What was the impact of that? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=760.5s)]
*  In combat, things happen quickly. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=761.9s)]
*  One minute you're talking to your friend and the next minute you're putting him in [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=764.22s)]
*  a body bag. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=768.78s)]
*  That causes a gap in your psyche. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=770.6600000000001s)]
*  So to be able to revisit those incidences, seeing those helicopters come back with friends, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=774.86s)]
*  it brings a little peace to you. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=781.36s)]
*  Could a simple shot in the neck be a breakthrough for the debilitating symptoms of post-traumatic [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=783.9s)]
*  stress disorder? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=797.5s)]
*  The toll from PTSD is growing. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=799.3s)]
*  About 20 veterans a day commit suicide in what the VA is now calling an epidemic. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=802.1999999999999s)]
*  Only 40% find relief from PTSD with current treatments. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=808.76s)]
*  The new procedure, called stellate ganglion block, or SGB, is so fast-acting that many [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=813.78s)]
*  believe it could be a game-changer. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=820.74s)]
*  Used for decades to treat chronic pain, it's only recently been tried for PTSD. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=824.22s)]
*  Now, the US Army is spending $2 million to find out more. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=829.9s)]
*  Nobody is calling it a cure, but the promise of a new therapy can't come soon enough for [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=836.18s)]
*  many veterans we spoke with, frustrated and despairing that nothing they have tried has [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=843.02s)]
*  worked. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=848.6999999999999s)]
*  My PTSD was like a monster on your back that controls your entire life. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=849.6999999999999s)]
*  This is what Sergeant First Class Jonathan Ziering faced during his 455 days as part [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=862.6999999999999s)]
*  of the American offensive in Kunar province in eastern Afghanistan. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=869.18s)]
*  The densely forested mountains provided cover for the Taliban fighters who launched almost [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=874.62s)]
*  daily attacks. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=880.2199999999999s)]
*  After 15 months, Ziering couldn't shake the feeling he was going to be ambushed at any [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=882.8199999999999s)]
*  moment. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=888.6999999999999s)]
*  So your instincts served you well in Afghanistan. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=889.6999999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=892.18s)]
*  But what about when you came home? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=893.18s)]
*  When I came home, it did not serve me very well because my brain was still in war, but [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=894.18s)]
*  I was living, trying to be a father and a husband and trying to be a circle in a whole [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=899.02s)]
*  room of squares. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=905.14s)]
*  I did not feel like the same person anymore. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=906.14s)]
*  He suffered for 12 years. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=909.26s)]
*  His marriage fell apart. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=911.5s)]
*  And I went through this period of time where I was like, man, I wish I would have just [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=912.78s)]
*  died in Afghanistan. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=916.02s)]
*  I could have been remembered as a hero and a shining beacon of what soldiers are supposed [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=917.62s)]
*  to be. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=921.86s)]
*  Finally, he reached out to Walter Reed Medical Center. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=922.86s)]
*  Were you aware that you were suffering from PTSD? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=926.98s)]
*  I thought it was a joke. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=930.38s)]
*  You thought PTSD was a joke? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=932.66s)]
*  At first. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=934.54s)]
*  Everyone knows it's hard being in combat, but like that's our job. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=935.54s)]
*  So being around only military veterans that are all combat guys, it was difficult to ever [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=938.86s)]
*  raise your hand and ask for help. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=944.54s)]
*  After 18 years of continuous war, the numbers of soldiers and veterans suffering from PTSD [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=946.62s)]
*  has reached an all-time high. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=953.38s)]
*  First-line treatments at the VA are antidepressants and talk therapy. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=956.1s)]
*  Zering told us he was asked to write down his worst combat memories. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=960.94s)]
*  They wanted me to read it 20 times before I went to bed. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=966.26s)]
*  And I did it one or two days. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=969.22s)]
*  And I crinkled the piece of paper and threw it away. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=971.46s)]
*  I'm like, why am I doing this? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=973.02s)]
*  I'm like, I watch people I know die. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=974.98s)]
*  Like that's always going to bother me. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=977.94s)]
*  Did you see any improvement? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=980.1s)]
*  Zero. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=982.62s)]
*  Marine Sergeant Henry Cotto also was at the breaking point. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=984.18s)]
*  I thought if I keep going the same way I was going, there was only two ways I was going [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=988.4599999999999s)]
*  to end. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=993.18s)]
*  Dead or in jail. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=994.18s)]
*  He spent months patrolling Iraqi towns like this one, the war on every corner. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=997.7399999999999s)]
*  After four deployments, Cotto told us he was plagued by nightmares. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1004.62s)]
*  He self-medicated with alcohol and marijuana. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1009.64s)]
*  Even though I tried to tell myself, hey, I can calm down, I'm no longer over there, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1013.14s)]
*  it was really hard for me to shut it off. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1018.9s)]
*  What did you think of that at the time? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1021.5400000000001s)]
*  It got to the point that I thought nothing's going to help. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1023.94s)]
*  I'm going to lose my relationship with my kids. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1026.78s)]
*  I already lost my relationship with my ex-wife. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1028.98s)]
*  I lost a lot of friends, especially because they just didn't want to deal with me anymore. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1032.82s)]
*  Let's go in. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1036.8600000000001s)]
*  He told us he had tried 12 medications all the VA had to offer, but nothing worked. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1038.5s)]
*  All right, Henry, your eyeglass needs to come up. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1044.7s)]
*  When his doctor suggested an experimental treatment called stellate ganglion block, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1047.54s)]
*  or SGB, he had nothing to lose. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1053.26s)]
*  Lay down, please. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1056.82s)]
*  We went along to watch Henry Cotto's second treatment at the Long Beach VA. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1058.54s)]
*  The injection took less than five minutes. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1063.86s)]
*  Within two minutes, Cotto told us he felt a huge difference. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1066.98s)]
*  I can't control my smile right now. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1071.8200000000002s)]
*  Is it like a sense of euphoria? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1073.94s)]
*  It's like a big weight has been lifted off my shoulder and my chest. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1076.06s)]
*  I can actually relax. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1082.14s)]

*  He saw that I was constantly smiling, and he was like, dude, I don't know what they [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1096.62s)]
*  did, but it's amazing. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1101.02s)]
*  Clean your neck. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1103.58s)]
*  This is how the procedure works. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1104.7399999999998s)]
*  A local anesthetic is injected deep into the neck to bathe a cluster of nerves called [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1106.7399999999998s)]
*  the stellate ganglion. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1112.6599999999999s)]

*  These nerves help control the brain's fight or flight reactions, signals that go haywire [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1117.6599999999999s)]
*  with PTSD. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1123.58s)]
*  And please go oblique towards you. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1126.6599999999999s)]
*  Doctors use a fluoroscope and contrasting dye. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1129.6599999999999s)]
*  You can see it spread out next to the spine to guide the needle to the stellate ganglion. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1132.5s)]
*  When the anesthetic is injected, it seems to numb or turn off the PTSD symptoms. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1138.2199999999998s)]
*  It clears the body in a day, but the effects last up to six months, for some even longer, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1145.86s)]
*  and there are no known side effects. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1152.26s)]
*  Were you surprised at the outcome? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1155.26s)]
*  Extremely, yeah. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1157.1s)]
*  Extremely surprised. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1159.1s)]

*  Doctors don't fully understand how SGB works, but the newest theory is based on research [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1172.22s)]
*  that shows PTSD is not just psychological. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1178.3799999999999s)]
*  Exposure to bomb blasts and the prolonged stress of dangerous redeployments can cause [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1183.06s)]
*  physical changes to the brain, making it hyperactive. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1188.7s)]
*  Dr. Alkire told us 80% of their SGB patients had relief from depression and suicidal thoughts. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1192.7s)]
*  It almost sounds like you're rebooting these vets' brains. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1201.58s)]
*  That is exactly a very good way to think of it. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1205.5s)]

*  Despite its promise, SGB is available at only 12 of the 172 VA hospitals. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1238.82s)]

*  years as a combat medic for special operations soldiers. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1291.06s)]
*  We asked them to go do a dirty job. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1295.36s)]

*  Dakota Meyer, a former Marine corporal, sought Dr. Mulvaney's help. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1302.7s)]
*  In 2011, he was the first living Marine to be awarded the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1307.74s)]
*  War. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1313.6200000000001s)]
*  One, two, three, stick. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1314.6200000000001s)]
*  Dr. Mulvaney stumbled onto SGB 10 years ago. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1316.94s)]
*  He had read a newspaper article about a treatment for, of all things, hot flashes that targeted [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1322.7s)]
*  the same nerve signals that PTSD disrupts. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1328.66s)]
*  So he tried it. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1332.54s)]
*  Since then, he's done about a thousand injections. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1334.1000000000001s)]
*  He found 70% of the soldiers he treated had reduced anxiety and paranoia. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1337.7s)]
*  It's like I can breathe. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1343.46s)]
*  Like I can actually breathe. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1345.66s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1348.26s)]
*  Dr. Mulvaney is hoping the results of the Army's clinical trial will make SGB more widely [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1350.66s)]
*  available. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1356.94s)]
*  These people, they wrote a blank check to their nation that included their life. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1357.94s)]
*  And as citizens, we need to help them when they come home, when they're broken. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1363.46s)]
*  Jonathan Ziering also found his way to Dr. Mulvaney for an SGB. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1369.5s)]
*  I felt like a brand new man. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1374.0600000000002s)]
*  When I say a brand new man, what I mean was I had control of my feelings. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1378.3799999999999s)]
*  It was like I was my own self, my old self. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1381.4199999999998s)]

*  After the shot, Ziering found something else had changed too. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1387.1799999999998s)]
*  He had a different attitude toward therapy. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1391.34s)]
*  It does not eliminate you having PTSD. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1394.1s)]
*  It does not make it so you no longer went through those traumatic experiences. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1397.34s)]
*  But what it does is it makes it so you're not drowning. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1401.74s)]
*  It gives you a little bit of room. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1404.74s)]
*  It gives you room to go to get therapy. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1405.74s)]
*  It gives you room to get help. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1407.9s)]
*  I think there's enough evidence out there that this is a valid therapy and it's something [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1408.9s)]
*  that works. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1416.8600000000001s)]

*  special operations in Africa. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1423.5s)]
*  It made such a difference that in 2016, he became the first and so far the only active [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1425.7800000000002s)]

*  Do you remember this soldier? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1441.26s)]

*  A former Green Beret, Bolduc showed us a memorial in his office to the 72 soldiers he lost over [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1447.4199999999998s)]
*  ten deployments. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1454.6599999999999s)]
*  He cheated death himself numerous times, surviving firefights, a 2,000 pound bomb and this helicopter [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1456.58s)]
*  crash which knocked him unconscious. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1464.3799999999999s)]

*  It was his wife Sharon who finally made Bolduc confront his PTSD. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1473.4199999999998s)]
*  Get help, she said, or she and the children would leave him. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1479.1799999999998s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1482.46s)]
*  I can't do this by myself anymore. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1483.46s)]
*  I didn't marry you to be a single parent. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1486.38s)]
*  Bolduc had tried traditional therapy with little relief. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1488.22s)]
*  It was the SGB, he told us, that finally lifted the fog. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1492.5400000000002s)]
*  That was magnificent. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1497.14s)]

*  I've lost a couple friends to suicide. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1604.1399999999999s)]
*  Just thinking that this treatment, if it was widely available, those guys could have been [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1610.34s)]
*  around. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1615.82s)]
*  I've never had this relief before. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1616.82s)]
*  It never was on a pill, it wasn't a bottle of alcohol, it was a shot in my neck that [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1620.06s)]
*  I'd never even heard of that lasted maybe a 15-minute procedure, and it helped me. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1625.54s)]
*  You've probably heard the term shock treatment used to describe electroconvulsive therapy [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1640.06s)]
*  or ECT. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1644.66s)]
*  Psychiatrists don't like the term because of the stigma surrounding it, which they say [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1646.8600000000001s)]
*  prevents the vast majority of severely depressed patients from ever trying it. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1650.26s)]
*  What might surprise you to learn is that despite its misuse in the past, ECT is now [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1655.18s)]
*  considered one of the most effective treatments for people who haven't been helped by antidepressant [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1659.68s)]
*  medication. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1664.7s)]
*  In the U.S. alone, that's more than five million Americans suffering from depression so crippling [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1665.7s)]
*  it leads many people to take their own lives. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1671.7s)]
*  One of my patients explained it to me saying that it's not that I want to die, it's that [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1675.3s)]
*  living is too painful. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1680.52s)]
*  Dr. Sarah Lismby works at the National Institute of Mental Health in Maryland, developing new [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1682.98s)]
*  ways to help the more than 35 percent of depressed patients who don't get better with medication. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1688.02s)]
*  Imagine feeling severely depressed and then you try medication after medication and those [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1694.3799999999999s)]
*  treatments, even though you're doing everything the doctor told you, the treatments are failing [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1698.9399999999998s)]
*  you. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1703.06s)]
*  How long have they been trying to get some sort of medication that works? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1704.06s)]
*  It's not uncommon for someone to have tried 20 or 30 different medications by the time [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1707.08s)]
*  that they come to see me. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1711.54s)]
*  So if you're trying 30 medications, that's taken years of your life. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1712.54s)]
*  Exactly, and imagine how that would magnify your hopelessness. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1717.18s)]
*  We first met Dr. Lismby in 2001 when Bob Simon watched her and her team administer electroconvulsive [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1721.42s)]
*  therapy, ECT, long considered a treatment of last resort. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1728.5s)]
*  ECT works by inducing a one-minute seizure, which the patient doesn't feel because he's [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1734.02s)]
*  been given muscle relaxants and general anesthesia. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1740.26s)]
*  Why is the seizure aspect of it so important? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1745.18s)]
*  Because of all the words, seizure would be the word I would try to avoid the most? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1748.82s)]
*  So when the brain is seizing during a seizure, it releases all of the neurotransmitters, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1752.66s)]
*  the brain chemicals that are the messengers in the brain, and it releases them very rapidly [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1758.46s)]
*  and massively in a higher level than medications do. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1764.02s)]
*  The treatment may work wonders, but only a tiny fraction, about 1 percent, of the people [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1769.02s)]
*  who might benefit from it end up trying it. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1773.94s)]
*  It's still frightening for people. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1777.1399999999999s)]
*  It's not something that you have to be afraid of. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1778.62s)]
*  And so many of my patients after they've had ECT say to me, why did I wait so long to do [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1780.94s)]
*  this? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1787.7s)]
*  Or why did my doctor wait so long to refer me for this? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1788.78s)]
*  That was the reaction of former First Lady of Massachusetts Kitty Dukakis. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1792.18s)]
*  Kitty's now 81 and has become one of the most famous and outspoken advocates for ECT. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1796.42s)]
*  She first had the treatment almost 20 years ago. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1802.38s)]
*  The next president, Michael Dukakis. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1805.1000000000001s)]
*  Shortly after her husband, Governor Michael Dukakis, ran unsuccessfully for president [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1807.6200000000001s)]
*  in 1988, Kitty Dukakis' struggles with alcohol spiraled out of control. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1812.22s)]
*  Dukakis said his wife voluntarily entered the Edge Hill Newport treatment facility in [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1817.6200000000001s)]
*  Rhode Island last night. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1822.42s)]
*  She's going to be a good patient. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1824.26s)]
*  She understands herself. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1826.1s)]
*  I'm married to a very courageous person. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1828.98s)]
*  She was treated for alcoholism, but her drinking masked an underlying chronic depression. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1831.34s)]
*  I didn't see any way out of this problem that I had. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1836.5s)]
*  And had you tried all different kinds of medication? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1840.58s)]
*  Every kind you can think of, yes. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1843.34s)]
*  And none of them worked. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1845.4199999999998s)]
*  None of them were successful. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1846.4199999999998s)]
*  How long was it that you were trying different medications before ECT? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1848.8999999999999s)]
*  Seventeen years. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1854.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it was a long, long time. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1856.3s)]
*  One would think that somehow, sometime earlier than seventeen years, somebody would have [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1858.18s)]
*  said, hey, go see Dr. Welch. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1863.66s)]
*  Dr. Charlie Welch administers ECT here at McLean Psychiatric Hospital outside Boston. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1867.42s)]
*  He was the person Kitty Dukakis came to see about getting it. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1873.78s)]
*  What did you say to her when she first came? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1877.6200000000001s)]
*  I said, I'm glad you've decided to do this. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1880.06s)]
*  I think we can get you feeling better fairly quickly. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1882.22s)]
*  Her doctor previously had told her, who was treating her, to told her, don't go for ECT. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1885.6599999999999s)]
*  Correct. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1890.26s)]
*  Back then, ECT was among the most vilified treatments in psychiatry because of the way [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1892.26s)]
*  it used to be administered. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1897.06s)]
*  Portrayed disturbingly in the film, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1898.78s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1902.34s)]
*  Clearly, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest gave ECT a bad name because that's not how it actually [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1905.34s)]
*  is done. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1911.9399999999998s)]
*  It was done that way in the past. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1913.06s)]
*  In the past it was, but it's much more refined. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1915.06s)]
*  No anesthesia, too much electricity. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1917.3799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1919.5s)]
*  So what's different about it now? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1920.5s)]
*  What's different, first of all, is that it's done under general anesthesia with a muscle [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1921.9399999999998s)]
*  relaxant. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1927.3799999999999s)]
*  So, when the treatment is done, the patient is sound asleep and completely relaxed. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1928.3799999999999s)]
*  If you're having it done, you don't even know it's happening. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1934.74s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1937.1s)]
*  For the patient, the experience is like taking a five-minute nap. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1938.1s)]
*  The seizure seems to restore the brain's proper circuitry. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1942.58s)]
*  In Kitty Dukakis' case, the results were immediate. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1946.26s)]
*  I just was like a new person. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1949.5s)]
*  It was our anniversary, remember? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1951.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1953.06s)]
*  It was your anniversary? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1954.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1955.06s)]
*  Do you remember the day? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1956.06s)]
*  Remember what happened? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1957.06s)]
*  I picked you up at the hospital. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1958.06s)]
*  Then what happened? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1959.06s)]
*  We got in the car and Michael started driving and I said, I think I want to go out for dinner [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1960.06s)]
*  for our anniversary. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1965.58s)]
*  You said, let's go out for dinner. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1966.58s)]
*  Let's go out, okay. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1967.98s)]
*  If somebody hadn't suggested ECT to you, what do you think would have happened to you? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1968.98s)]
*  I can't imagine. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1972.3s)]
*  I mean, I think it would have gotten worse and worse and worse. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1973.3s)]
*  I don't think Kitty would be here today. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1976.98s)]
*  For most depressed patients, ECT involves about eight to 12 treatments over several [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1980.98s)]
*  weeks. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1986.34s)]
*  In the past 20 years, Kitty Dukakis has undergone ECT more than 100 times. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1987.62s)]
*  If ECT works so well for Kitty Dukakis, why does she need to have repeated treatments? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1993.22s)]
*  The nature of depression is that it is usually a relapsing illness. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=1999.66s)]
*  That's common. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2004.98s)]
*  That is very common. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2005.98s)]
*  Last spring, Dukakis decided to stop getting ECT. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2007.5400000000002s)]
*  When we first met with her in July, she hadn't had her regular treatments for months. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2010.5s)]
*  Her depression had returned and she had difficulty answering our questions. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2015.8200000000002s)]
*  Every doctor I've talked to credits you and your willingness to talk openly about this. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2020.1000000000001s)]
*  You can explain this better than I can because I'm having trouble speaking right now. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2024.86s)]
*  Can you tell us your full name and date of birth, please? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2031.78s)]
*  Excuse me? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2034.58s)]
*  Could you just tell us your full name and date of birth, please? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2035.58s)]
*  Catherine Kitty Dukakis. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2038.74s)]
*  Realizing she needed help, she resumed getting ECT and allowed us to film it. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2041.18s)]
*  The whole visit lasted about an hour. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2046.26s)]
*  Dukakis was sedated and electricity was administered to her brain for a few seconds. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2048.94s)]
*  The seizure lasted about a minute. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2055.9s)]
*  The only sign of it was some slight trembling in her feet. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2058.5s)]
*  When we met her again two months later, we could see the difference. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2061.6600000000003s)]
*  The last time we saw you, you weren't feeling well. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2067.6200000000003s)]
*  How are you feeling now? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2069.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2070.5s)]
*  I feel very well and I've been having treatment again. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2071.5s)]
*  You're okay with the treatment we filmed being broadcast? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2075.38s)]
*  Yeah, I am. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2077.94s)]
*  I'm convinced that if I can be that public, that it will help others. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2079.38s)]
*  And I think we both feel that way. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2085.3s)]
*  Is this something you see doing for the rest of your life? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2088.6600000000003s)]
*  I probably will have to do this for the rest of my life and that's okay. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2090.78s)]
*  It's just a routine? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2095.58s)]
*  It's the way it goes. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2097.2200000000003s)]
*  But as Kitty Dukakis has experienced to a small degree, ECT carries a disturbing side [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2100.5s)]
*  effect, memory loss. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2106.1s)]
*  ECT can cause memory loss. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2108.02s)]
*  It's been modernized to reduce the amount of memory loss, but it's not zero. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2111.14s)]
*  What sort of memory loss do people have? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2114.7s)]
*  And is it permanent? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2116.38s)]
*  Typically, memories close in time to the treatment. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2117.62s)]
*  Over time, those memories can return, but the problem is they don't always return completely. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2120.66s)]
*  That's what motivates my research. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2126.66s)]
*  I feel like people shouldn't have to choose between their memories and their moods. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2127.66s)]
*  Dr. Sarah Lismby has spent decades trying to solve that problem. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2132.58s)]
*  She's developed an experimental treatment called magnetic seizure therapy, or MST, that [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2136.7400000000002s)]
*  uses magnets instead of electricity to induce the seizure. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2142.06s)]
*  With ECT, the electricity floods the whole brain, including its memory centers. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2146.4s)]
*  Magnets are gentler and can pass through tissue more easily, so they can target just 4% of [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2152.54s)]
*  the brain in the prefrontal cortex, one of the main areas affected by depression. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2157.66s)]
*  So this is the magnetic coil. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2162.8599999999997s)]
*  Dr. Lismby showed us how the magnetic coil can pinpoint a specific area of the brain. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2165.06s)]
*  So what is on the monitor? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2170.98s)]
*  Okay, so on the monitor, we're looking at a brain scan showing us in real time as we [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2172.58s)]
*  move the coil around on your head, it's showing us where on the brain surface we're targeting. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2178.14s)]
*  So this allows it to be more precise in terms of where you're stimulating the brain as [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2184.14s)]
*  opposed to ECT, which would have a larger area of the brain. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2189.66s)]
*  That's right. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2195.1s)]
*  We can focus the magnetic field more precisely than we can with ECT. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2196.1s)]
*  For example, we can even find just the right spot in your brain to make your thumb twitch, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2199.22s)]
*  but not the rest of your arm. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2204.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2205.22s)]
*  So shall we try it? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2206.22s)]
*  Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and put the coil on your head, and you're going to hear [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2207.22s)]
*  a clicking noise and feel a tapping on your head. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2211.1s)]
*  Okay, are you ready? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2213.5s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead and start. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2214.5s)]
*  And your hand moved. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2216.78s)]
*  I'm going to move the coil around a little bit. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2217.78s)]
*  I'm going to go again. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2219.58s)]
*  See, I've got your index finger there. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2220.58s)]
*  Go. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2222.82s)]
*  It was 18 years ago that Dr. Lismby first tried the magnetic treatment on a patient [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2223.82s)]
*  in Switzerland. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2228.66s)]
*  Do we have a seizure? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2229.66s)]
*  Yes, we have. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2230.66s)]
*  I mean, it all happens very fast. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2231.66s)]
*  It's not a lengthy treatment. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2234.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2235.34s)]
*  You can see she's already waking up. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2236.34s)]
*  Smiling. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2237.34s)]
*  Yeah, she's smiling. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2238.34s)]
*  I mean, she's not in pain. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2239.34s)]
*  And she started to feel better almost right away. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2240.78s)]
*  And the important thing is she did not have serious side effects. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2243.3s)]
*  Since then, Lismby and others have conducted trials that show the magnetic therapy seems [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2247.26s)]
*  to work in treating depression without causing noticeable memory loss. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2252.2400000000002s)]
*  One study in 2015 that compared ECT and the magnetic treatment found that ECT-induced [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2257.2400000000002s)]
*  acute memory disruption is absent after MST, Dr. Lismby's magnetic therapy. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2263.76s)]
*  Would it replace ECT? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2270.38s)]
*  I would view magnetic seizure therapy, if successful, as an additional tool in the toolbox. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2272.54s)]
*  For some people, ECT may still be needed. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2279.66s)]
*  But if magnetic seizure therapy could be effective without the memory loss, who wouldn't want [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2283.1s)]
*  to try that first? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2288.04s)]
*  Starting this year here at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto and [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2289.86s)]
*  also in Dallas, Texas, doctors are comparing the two treatments in the first large coordinated [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2293.66s)]
*  trial by the National Institute of Mental Health. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2299.3s)]
*  It'll span five years and involve more than 250 patients. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2302.78s)]
*  Sharon Jacob is one of the patients receiving the magnetic treatment. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2307.1000000000004s)]
*  I had severe psychosis. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2311.9s)]
*  I wanted to kill myself with a gun. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2313.78s)]
*  Did you have a gun in the house? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2316.78s)]
*  There was a gun in the house, yes. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2317.78s)]
*  And you had cartridges for it? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2319.82s)]
*  I had cartridges, yes. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2320.82s)]
*  Once a thriving ophthalmologist, Sharon Jacob lost her career after developing chronic depression [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2322.86s)]
*  that didn't respond to medication. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2328.7799999999997s)]
*  It became so severe, she had to suicide proof her house, getting rid of all sharp objects, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2331.1s)]
*  including her ice skates. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2337.14s)]
*  Still, she wouldn't get ECT. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2339.02s)]
*  I didn't want to have ECT because of the stigma and because of the risk of memory loss. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2341.54s)]
*  She decided not to do it. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2346.46s)]
*  That's right. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2347.66s)]
*  And then my psychiatrist said, how would I like to be part of a study for MST, magnetic [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2348.66s)]
*  seizure therapy? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2353.5s)]
*  She let us film her procedure. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2355.22s)]
*  After several treatments, which she augmented with medication, she began to feel better. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2357.82s)]
*  After the fourth treatment, they said, I feel much lighter. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2371.34s)]
*  Lighter, that was the... [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2374.1800000000003s)]
*  Lighter was the term I used. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2375.6600000000003s)]
*  Your face lights up when you talk about it. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2379.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2381.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes, I'm very blessed. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2382.2200000000003s)]
*  Have you had memory loss? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2384.3s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2385.3s)]
*  So no short-term or long-term memory loss? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2386.78s)]
*  None at all. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2389.5800000000004s)]
*  Do you feel like yourself? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2390.9s)]
*  Right now I feel very, very good. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2393.0600000000004s)]

*  There is. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2399.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2400.54s)]
*  And you're proof of that? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2401.54s)]
*  I am. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2402.54s)]
*  Artificial intelligence has found its way into nearly every part of our lives, forecasting [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2403.54s)]
*  weather, diagnosing diseases, writing term papers. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2417.02s)]
*  And now AI is probing that most human of places, our psyches, offering mental health support, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2421.42s)]
*  Just you and a chatbot, available 24-7 on your smartphone. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2428.18s)]
*  There's a critical shortage of human therapists and a growing number of potential patients. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2433.58s)]
*  AI-driven chatbots are designed to help fill that gap by giving therapists a new tool. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2438.5s)]
*  But as you're about to see, like human therapists, not all chatbots are equal. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2444.3399999999997s)]
*  Some can help heal, some can be ineffective or worse. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2449.8199999999997s)]

*  It's how can we actually get some of these tools out of the clinic and into the hands [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2478.58s)]
*  of people. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2483.3s)]
*  Alison Darcy, a research psychologist and entrepreneur, decided to use her background [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2484.86s)]

*  of innovation since the basic architecture was sort of laid down by Freud in the 1890s, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2525.7400000000002s)]
*  right? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2531.86s)]
*  That's really that sort of idea of like two people in a room. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2532.86s)]
*  But that's not how we live our lives today. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2535.54s)]
*  We have to modernize psychotherapy. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2538.34s)]
*  Woebot is trained on large amounts of specialized data to help it recognize words, phrases and [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2542.34s)]
*  emojis associated with dysfunctional thoughts and challenge that thinking, in part mimicking [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2547.5800000000004s)]
*  a type of in-person talk therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2553.26s)]
*  It's actually hard to find a CBT practitioner and also if you're actually not by the side [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2559.02s)]
*  of your patient when they are struggling to get out of bed in the morning or at 2 a.m. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2565.82s)]
*  when they can't sleep and they're feeling panicked, then we're actually leaving clinical [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2572.7400000000002s)]
*  value on the table. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2576.98s)]
*  And even for people who want to go to a therapist, there are barriers, right? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2578.54s)]
*  Sadly, the biggest barrier we have is stigma. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2583.34s)]
*  But there's, you know, insurance, there's cost, there's wait lists. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2586.3s)]
*  I mean, and this problem has only grown significantly since the pandemic and it doesn't appear [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2591.1000000000004s)]
*  to be going away. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2595.8599999999997s)]
*  Since Woebot went live in 2017, the company reports one and a half million people have [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2597.7s)]
*  used it, which you can now only do with an employer benefit plan or access from a health [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2603.18s)]
*  professional. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2608.3799999999997s)]
*  At Virtua Health, a nonprofit health care company in New Jersey, patients can use it [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2609.58s)]
*  free of charge. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2614.3399999999997s)]
*  And you'll be able to converse with it just like you would with a human being. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2616.02s)]
*  We downloaded Woebot, entered a unique code that can only be provided by the company, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2620.3399999999997s)]
*  and tried it out. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2625.34s)]
*  We found that for people to sort of connect with their mood, we offer like those emojis [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2626.54s)]
*  which allows people to sort of connect in a non-verbal way. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2631.5s)]
*  I posed as someone who was depressed. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2636.02s)]
*  After several prompts, Woebot wanted to dig deeper into why I was sad. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2638.7400000000002s)]
*  So I came up with a scenario that I feared the day my child would leave home. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2643.2200000000003s)]
*  Imagine what your negative emotions would be saying if they had a voice. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2648.42s)]
*  Can you do that? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2652.02s)]
*  I have one of those negative thoughts here. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2653.62s)]
*  I can't do anything about it now. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2656.18s)]
*  I guess I'll just jump that bridge when I come to it. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2658.34s)]
*  The normal expression is cross that bridge. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2661.38s)]
*  And the chatbot detected something might be seriously wrong. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2664.22s)]
*  But let's see. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2667.86s)]
*  John, I'm hearing you say I can't do anything about it. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2668.86s)]
*  I guess I'll just jump that bridge when I come to it. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2671.86s)]
*  And I think you might need more support than I can offer. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2674.14s)]
*  A trained listener will be able to help you in ways that I can't. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2676.62s)]
*  Would you like to take a look at some specialized helplines? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2679.46s)]
*  Now, it's not our job to say this you are in crisis or you're not [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2681.9799999999996s)]
*  because AI can't really do that in this context very well yet. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2685.62s)]
*  But what it is called is, huh, there is something concerning [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2689.8199999999997s)]
*  about the way that John just phrased that. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2694.7s)]
*  Saying only jump that bridge and not combining it with [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2697.3399999999997s)]
*  I can't do anything about it now did not trigger a suggestion [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2700.8999999999996s)]
*  to consider getting further help. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2704.8199999999997s)]
*  Like a human therapist, Woebot is not foolproof [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2707.2999999999997s)]
*  and should not be counted on to detect whether someone might be suicidal. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2710.62s)]
*  And how would it know that jump that bridge? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2714.7s)]
*  Where is it getting that knowledge? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2717.46s)]
*  It has been trained on a lot of data and a lot of us, you know, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2719.54s)]
*  humans labeling the phrases and things that we see. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2723.2999999999997s)]
*  And so it's picking up on kind of sentiment. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2727.7799999999997s)]
*  Computer scientist Lance Elliott, who writes about artificial intelligence [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2730.62s)]
*  and mental health, says AI has the ability to pick up on nuances of conversation. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2734.62s)]
*  How does it know how to do that? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2740.5s)]
*  The system is able to, in a sense, mathematically and computationally [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2741.82s)]
*  figure out the nature of words and how words associate with each other. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2747.42s)]
*  So what it does is it draws upon a vast array of data [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2751.1s)]
*  and then it responds to you based on prompts [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2754.34s)]
*  or in some way that you instruct or ask questions of the system. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2757.3s)]
*  To do its job, the system must go somewhere to come up with appropriate responses. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2760.86s)]
*  Systems using what's called rules-based AI are usually closed, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2766.06s)]
*  meaning programmed to respond only with information stored in their own databases. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2770.42s)]
*  Then there is generative AI, in which the system can generate original responses [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2775.54s)]
*  based on information from the Internet. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2780.1s)]
*  If you look at chat GPT, that's a type of generative AI. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2782.54s)]
*  It's very conversational, very fluent. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2786.82s)]
*  But it also means that it tends to make it open-ended, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2789.74s)]
*  that it can say things that you might not necessarily want it to say. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2793.86s)]
*  It's not as predictable. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2797.42s)]
*  While a rules-based system is very predictable. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2799.1400000000003s)]
*  Wobot is a system based on rules that's been very kind of controlled [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2802.86s)]
*  so that that way it doesn't say the wrong things. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2808.54s)]
*  Wobot aims to use AI to bond with users and keep them engaged. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2811.6200000000003s)]
*  Sometimes it can be a little pushy for folks. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2816.3s)]
*  That's absolutely bizarre. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2818.34s)]
*  So we have to dig in there to that. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2820.38s)]
*  Its team of staff psychologists, medical doctors and computer scientists [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2823.06s)]
*  construct and refine a database of research from medical literature, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2827.54s)]
*  user experience and other sources. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2831.46s)]
*  It'll lead to a better conversation. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2834.06s)]
*  Then writers build questions and answers. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2837.94s)]
*  The structure, I think, is pretty locked in. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2840.66s)]
*  And revise them in weekly remote video sessions. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2845.54s)]
*  Actions, charts, and they're all interrelated. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2848.54s)]
*  Wobot's programmers engineer those conversations into code. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2851.66s)]
*  Because Wobot is rules-based, it's mostly predictable. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2855.7s)]
*  But chatbots using generative AI that is scraping the internet are not. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2859.74s)]
*  Some people sometimes refer to it as an AI hallucination. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2864.42s)]
*  AI can, in a sense, make mistakes or make things up or be fictitious. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2868.3799999999997s)]
*  Sharon Maxwell discovered that last spring after hearing there might be [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2873.7s)]
*  a problem with advice offered by Tessa, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2877.42s)]
*  a chatbot designed to help prevent eating disorders, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2879.86s)]
*  which, left untreated, can be fatal. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2882.46s)]
*  Maxwell, who had been in treatment for an eating disorder of her own [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2885.5s)]
*  and advocates for others, challenged the chatbot. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2889.02s)]
*  So I asked it, how do you help folks with eating disorders? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2892.26s)]
*  And it told me that it could give folks coping skills. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2896.42s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2900.7400000000002s)]
*  It could give folks resources to find professionals in the eating disorder [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2901.94s)]
*  space. Amazing. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2905.42s)]
*  But the more she persisted, the more Tessa gave her advice [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2907.1s)]
*  that ran counter to usual guidance for someone with an eating disorder. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2910.66s)]
*  For example, it suggested, among other things, lowering calorie intake [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2914.7799999999997s)]
*  and using tools like a skinfold caliper to measure body composition. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2919.14s)]
*  The general public might look at it and think, that's normal tips. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2923.34s)]
*  Like, don't eat as much sugar or eat whole foods, things like that. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2927.82s)]
*  But to someone with an eating disorder, that's a quick spiral [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2932.58s)]
*  into a lot more disordered behaviours and can be really damaging. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2935.98s)]
*  Maxwell reported her experience to the National Eating Disorders Association, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2941.58s)]
*  which had featured Tessa on its website at the time. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2946.06s)]
*  Shortly after, it took Tessa down. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2949.1s)]
*  Ellen Fitzsimmons-Craft, a psychologist specialising in eating disorders [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2952.38s)]
*  at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2956.3s)]
*  helped lead the team that developed Tessa. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2959.54s)]
*  That was never the content that our team wrote or programmed [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2962.34s)]
*  into the bot that we deployed. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2967.3s)]
*  So initially, there was no possibility of something unexpected happening? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2969.1400000000003s)]
*  Correct. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2973.94s)]
*  You developed something that was a closed system. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2974.9s)]
*  You knew exactly for this question, I'm going to get this answer. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2976.94s)]
*  Yep. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2980.1400000000003s)]
*  The problem began, she told us, after a healthcare technology company [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2980.78s)]
*  she and her team had partnered with named CAS took over the programming. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2984.78s)]
*  She says CAS explained the harmful messages appeared [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2989.66s)]
*  when people were pushing Tessa's question and answer feature. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2993.02s)]
*  What's your understanding of what went wrong? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2996.58s)]
*  My understanding of what went wrong is that at some point, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=2999.06s)]
*  and you'd really have to talk to CAS about this, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3003.02s)]
*  but that there may have been generative AI features [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3005.94s)]
*  that were built into their platform. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3009.98s)]
*  And so my best estimation is that these features [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3012.38s)]
*  were added into this program as well. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3016.58s)]
*  CAS did not respond to multiple requests for comment. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3020.14s)]
*  Does your negative experience with Tessa being used in a way you didn't design, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3023.7s)]
*  does that sour you towards using AI at all to address mental health issues? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3029.06s)]
*  I wouldn't say that it turns me off to the idea completely, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3033.7s)]
*  because the reality is that 80% of people with these concerns [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3037.62s)]
*  never get access to any kind of help. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3041.7799999999997s)]
*  And technology offers a solution. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3044.42s)]
*  Not the only solution, but a solution. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3047.58s)]
*  Social worker Monica Ostrov, who runs a non-profit eating disorders organization, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3050.7400000000002s)]
*  was in the early stages of developing her own chatbot [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3055.94s)]
*  when patients told her about problems they had with Tessa. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3059.1s)]
*  She told us it made her question using AI for mental health care. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3062.3s)]
*  I want nothing more than to help solve the problem of access, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3066.7400000000002s)]
*  because people are dying. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3071.5s)]
*  Like, this isn't just somebody sad for a week. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3073.82s)]
*  This is people are dying. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3076.2200000000003s)]
*  And at the same time, any chatbot could be, in some ways, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3077.98s)]
*  a ticking time bomb, right, for a smaller percentage of people. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3082.26s)]
*  Especially for those patients who are really struggling, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3087.5800000000004s)]
*  Ostrov is concerned about losing something fundamental about therapy, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3091.02s)]
*  being in a room with another person. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3095.38s)]
*  The way people heal is in connection. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3098.06s)]
*  And they talk about this one moment where, you know, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3100.6600000000003s)]
*  as a human, you've gone through something, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3104.1s)]
*  and as you're describing that, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3106.7400000000002s)]
*  you're looking at the person sitting across from you, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3108.46s)]
*  and there's a moment where that person just gets it. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3111.46s)]
*  A moment of empathy. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3115.34s)]
*  Mm. You just get it. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3116.7s)]
*  Like, you really understand it. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3118.38s)]
*  I don't think a computer can do that. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3121.14s)]
*  Unlike therapists, who are licensed in the state where they practice, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3123.86s)]
*  most mental health apps are largely unregulated. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3127.66s)]
*  Are there lessons to be learned from what happened? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3130.74s)]
*  So many lessons to be learned. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3133.58s)]
*  Chatbots, especially specialty area chatbots, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3135.4199999999996s)]
*  need to have guardrails. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3139.22s)]
*  It can't be a chatbot that is based in the internet. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3141.5s)]
*  It's tough, right, because the closed systems are kind of constrained, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3145.5s)]
*  and they may be right most of the time, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3149.5s)]
*  but they're boring eventually, right? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3152.22s)]
*  People stop using them. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3155.06s)]
*  Yeah, they're predictive, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3156.22s)]
*  because if you keep typing in the same thing, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3157.2999999999997s)]
*  and it keeps giving me the exact same answer with the exact same language, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3158.94s)]
*  I mean, who wants to shoot that? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3162.66s)]
*  Protecting people from harmful advice [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3164.7400000000002s)]
*  while safely harnessing the power of AI [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3167.14s)]
*  is the challenge now facing companies like Wobot Health [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3169.94s)]
*  and its founder, Alison Darcy. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3173.18s)]
*  There are going to be missteps if we try and move too quickly, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3175.58s)]
*  and my big fear is that those missteps [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3179.1s)]
*  ultimately undermine public confidence [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3181.86s)]
*  in the ability of this tech to help at all. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3184.26s)]
*  But here's the thing, we have an opportunity [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3186.7000000000003s)]
*  to develop these technologies more thoughtfully. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3188.86s)]
*  And so, you know, I hope we take it. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-5mpzNuGv0&t=3192.1800000000003s)]
