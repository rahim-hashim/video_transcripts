# World's Most Interesting Places: Vol. 7 | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M)
*  The nuclear meltdown in Chernobyl in Ukraine was 30 years ago, but the crisis is still [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=0.0s)]
*  with us today. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=27.52s)]
*  That's because radiation virtually never dies. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=29.12s)]
*  After the explosion in 1986, the Soviets built a primitive sarcophagus, a tomb, to cover [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=32.84s)]
*  the stricken reactor, but it wasn't meant to last very long and it hasn't. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=39.3s)]
*  Engineers say there's still enough radioactive material in there to cause widespread contamination. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=44.44s)]
*  For the last five years, a massive project has been underway to seal the reactor permanently, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=49.64s)]
*  but the undertaking is three quarters of a billion dollars short and the completion [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=56.52s)]
*  date has been delayed repeatedly. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=60.84s)]
*  30 years later, Chernobyl's crippled reactor still has the power to kill. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=62.96s)]
*  It's called the zone and getting into it is crossing a border into one of the most contaminated [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=71.36s)]
*  places on earth. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=76.44s)]
*  The 20-mile no man's land was evacuated nearly 30 years ago. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=80.0s)]
*  If you drive to the center of the zone today, then you'll see a massive structure that appears [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=84.76s)]
*  to rise out of nowhere. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  It's an engineering effort the likes of which the world has never seen. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  With funds from over 40 different countries, 1,400 workers are building a giant arch to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=98.04s)]
*  cover the damaged reactor like a casserole. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=104.28s)]
*  It will be taller than the Statue of Liberty and wider than Yankee Stadium, the largest [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=107.76s)]
*  movable structure on earth. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  Nicolas Cai is overseeing the arch's construction. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=116.08s)]
*  You know, when you think about it, you had this massive project going on, all these people [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=119.08s)]
*  working here, billions of dollars being spent because of one day 30 years ago. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=131.88s)]
*  It was the biggest disaster of the nuclear industry, yes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=133.88s)]
*  The disaster was sparked by massive explosions that tore the roof off of Chernobyl's reactor [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=138.8s)]
*  number four, spewing radioactive dust into the atmosphere. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=144.24s)]
*  The Soviets drafted over half a million troops to put out the fire and clear the nuclear [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=152.08s)]
*  debris. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=157.24s)]
*  Thousands got seriously ill from radiation exposure. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=158.8s)]
*  Today, three decades later, the cleanup continues. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=163.84s)]
*  But as this recent video shows, the reactor is still packed with poison. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=168.28s)]
*  Heaps of gnarled steel and concrete, pools of nuclear fuel that have hardened into a [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  dense mass called the elephant's foot. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  There's still so much radiation coming from the reactor that workers have to construct [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=185.88000000000002s)]
*  the arch nearly a thousand feet away, shielded by a massive concrete wall. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=190.48s)]
*  When finished, the arch will be slid into place around the sarcophagus, then sealed [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=201.64s)]
*  We will push it in once. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=203.17999999999998s)]
*  The average speed will be around 10 meter an hour. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  So it's approximately the speed of a snail. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=210.56s)]
*  Right, but that's pretty rapid considering the size of this thing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=214.48s)]
*  But the construction itself will have to move a lot quicker. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  The old plant and sarcophagus are falling apart. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=225.96s)]
*  Just two years ago, a snowstorm caused the roof of one of the buildings to collapse, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=229.62s)]
*  forcing workers to be evacuated and raising fears of further contamination. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=234.88000000000002s)]
*  Radiation is not subject to the usual rules of life and death. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=243.84s)]
*  It is virtually eternal. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  When Kai took us on a tour of the site, we were fitted with dosimeters to tell us how [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=249.68s)]
*  much we were being exposed to. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=254.12s)]
*  Suddenly, a sound we didn't want to hear. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=256.44s)]
*  Hey, this beeper's going off. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=259.56s)]
*  No, no, it's not, it's normal. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=261.64s)]
*  You're sure? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=263.64s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, I'm definitely sure. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=264.64s)]
*  I don't like a beeper in Chernobyl. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=266.8s)]
*  I don't like that sound. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=269.64s)]
*  Building the arch under these conditions is challenging enough, but some of the biggest [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=273.12s)]
*  The project is also $770 million short and has been plagued by repeated delays. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  No matter when it's completed, vast stretches of the zone will never recover. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=293.48s)]
*  This is the city of Pripyat, two miles from the reactor. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=298.76s)]
*  30 years ago, the population was 50,000. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=303.0s)]
*  Today it is zero. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=306.56s)]
*  Pripyat was where many of the plant's workers lived, grateful for their posting in a town [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=310.32s)]
*  that was the model of Soviet modernity. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=315.6s)]
*  Nine-story apartment buildings lined this boulevard. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=318.88s)]
*  They're still there, but you can't see them anymore. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=322.36s)]
*  The forest has taken over. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=325.32s)]
*  A vision perhaps of what the whole world might look like were people to just disappear. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=327.6s)]
*  It was springtime in Pripyat that day in 1986, and an amusement park was due to open in a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=335.44s)]
*  few days. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=341.6s)]
*  Andrei Glukhov lived here then. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=342.92s)]
*  So that ferris wheel never had any kids in it? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=346.24s)]
*  Never had any kids. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=349.16s)]
*  These bumper cars on your left had never kids in it too. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=350.4s)]
*  When you talk to your former neighbors, what do you call it? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=356.12s)]
*  The accident, the catastrophe? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=360.52s)]
*  We just call it 26, which was the date of the accident. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=362.91999999999996s)]
*  26? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  26 of April. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=368.91999999999996s)]
*  Sort of like the Americans call 9-11. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=372.68s)]
*  Back then, Glukhov worked for Chernobyl's Nuclear Safety Division. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=373.68s)]
*  He took us on a tour through a part of the plant that had not been destroyed. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=379.36s)]
*  He was off duty that night, but what he saw when he drove past the damaged reactor was [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  like nothing he or anyone else had ever seen. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=390.44s)]
*  This was a terrifying picture. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  It looked like a sunset in the distance about 100, 200 yards from you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=398.32s)]
*  And this was the glowing core of the reactor. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=410.12s)]
*  That was the first and the only time you saw it? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=415.88s)]
*  No, that was the first time when I realized the scale of the disaster. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=419.36s)]
*  Glukhov told his family in Pripyat to stay inside and close the windows. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=432.32s)]
*  Soviet authorities covered the area with secrecy, told people they had nothing to worry about. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=438.0s)]
*  But 36 hours later, over a thousand buses were sent in to evacuate everyone. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=444.47999999999996s)]
*  Authorities told people it would only be for three days, one of many lives. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=451.47999999999996s)]
*  The people never came back, and Pripyat is being overwhelmed by the elements. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=457.15999999999997s)]
*  Some of the only things still recognizable is that old Soviet iconography. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=463.2s)]
*  Drive through the zone and you'll find that many villages suffer the same fate as Pripyat. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  A row of simple markers has been planted with the names of each one. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=478.48s)]
*  But amidst this wilderness, the strangest sight of all, people. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=483.64s)]
*  Just a few. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  Ivan Ivanovich and his wife Maria were evacuated to an apartment block near Kiev after the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=491.0s)]
*  accident but couldn't take it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  They weren't made for the city, so two years later they came back. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=500.0s)]
*  Today, there are three other people living in this village, just a few miles from the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=504.0s)]
*  old power plant. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=509.12s)]
*  When you decided to come back to live here, did anyone tell you it was dangerous? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  It's really okay here. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=520.12s)]
*  You know, when I lived in that apartment block, I got sick all the time. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=522.44s)]
*  But when I came back here, I was fine, and I've been fine ever since. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=528.28s)]
*  You should never leave home. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=532.88s)]
*  I would be long gone if I'd stayed there. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=535.08s)]
*  I'd be in the ground. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=538.4s)]
*  Despite the danger, Tim Musso also chose to be here. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=541.32s)]
*  For the last 15 years, the University of South Carolina biologist has been studying [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=546.24s)]
*  the contamination's impact from a makeshift lab inside the zone. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=552.48s)]
*  Aren't many serious labs I've seen that look like this. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=557.64s)]
*  Yeah, this is an opportunistic lab. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  It's an old villager's house. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=564.4s)]
*  Musso's research has shown that the catastrophe continues to take its toll. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=566.6s)]
*  And we're going to attempt to measure just how radioactive these mice are. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=572.52s)]
*  What's the comparison between the amounts of radiation a mouse would have here and a [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=577.48s)]

*  He used to be a penniless trapper and mushroom picker, but the gold he says he's found could [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=821.66s)]
*  be worth billions. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=827.1s)]
*  And that might be just the beginning, because the government has decided to open a whole [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=829.06s)]

*  over a hundred years ago. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=848.02s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he probably does. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=948.86s)]
*  But why is everybody so secretive around here? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=951.62s)]
*  Well, who knows? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=954.82s)]
*  You know, it's like everybody's bank account. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=957.82s)]

*  In the last gold rush, 30,000 miners burst into Dawson. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=964.3s)]
*  Some struck it rich. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=968.62s)]
*  Many others went broke or died. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=970.18s)]
*  Dawson looks pretty much the same today. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=972.9s)]
*  You can still see the old miner shacks near the aptly named Bonanza Creek, where the first [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=975.7s)]
*  gold was discovered. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=981.34s)]
*  It's called placer gold, a name used for river gold. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=983.06s)]
*  The old prospectors would put a shaft down under the creek. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=987.06s)]
*  Sean Ryan, a prospector, says a lot of placer gold has been mined here. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=990.9399999999999s)]
*  They figure at the turn of the century, there was somewhere between 13 and 20 million ounces [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=996.34s)]
*  of placer gold taken out of the Klondike. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1001.14s)]
*  Which is worth what then? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1003.02s)]
*  Right now, that'd be worth well over, you know, between 13 and 20 billion dollars worth [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1004.3s)]
*  of gold. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1008.42s)]
*  It's at today's prices, so. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1009.42s)]
*  A hundred years later, they're still mining the same creeks and river banks. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1011.9s)]

*  Ian Thomas is digging dirt that's already been mined once. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1022.86s)]
*  He's looking for leftovers. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1027.06s)]

*  We have good years, we have bad years. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1036.66s)]
*  In other words, you don't really want to answer the question. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1039.22s)]
*  Not really. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1041.66s)]
*  Dave Miller also didn't want to tell us how much gold he finds, but he did show us the [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1043.0600000000002s)]

*  Yes, that is gold. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1054.42s)]
*  That is placer gold. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1055.76s)]
*  There's about two ounces of gold in there. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1056.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1058.66s)]
*  So that's $2,400. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1059.66s)]
*  This is $2,400 bucks. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1060.66s)]
*  Yep. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1063.0600000000002s)]
*  Then Miller showed us the most valuable thing his family's found in 40 years, a three-ounce [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1064.0600000000002s)]

*  He lets you hold it for a while, but just for a while. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1073.0600000000002s)]
*  There are no free samples in Dawson. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1076.66s)]
*  We don't find too many nuggets anymore. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1079.28s)]
*  This would be big stuff compared to what we find today. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1080.9s)]
*  But prospector Sean Ryan says he's found a lot of big stuff, and investors have poured [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1084.14s)]
*  money into the Yukon because of him. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1089.18s)]
*  Ryan doesn't dig up river banks, he prospects in the mountains. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1092.18s)]
*  It's more challenging. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1096.28s)]
*  And if you do it right, he says, infinitely more lucrative. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1097.94s)]
*  So now you're a multimillionaire. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1101.7s)]

*  And I got a bunch of acorns at the base of the tree. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1112.18s)]
*  So you don't really change. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1115.74s)]
*  Not that long ago, Sean Ryan was dead broke. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1118.3400000000001s)]
*  To survive, he trapped animals and picked mushrooms. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1121.8200000000002s)]
*  He says you can make $50,000 a season picking these delectable morels. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1125.76s)]
*  When we heard that mushroom picking helped Ryan become a gold prospector, we went to [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1131.84s)]
*  track him down on a steep, burned out mountainside, where he still picks mushrooms for fun. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1136.2s)]
*  OK, into the mushroom patch. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1142.36s)]
*  This was last year's fire. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1144.92s)]
*  Started by lightning? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1147.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1148.24s)]
*  How do you know where to look? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1149.24s)]
*  Well, that's where you research it. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1150.24s)]
*  These mushrooms come one year after a forest fire, and it only happens for a month. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1152.56s)]
*  It's kind of like magic. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1156.72s)]
*  They magically appear, and it's only in that period of time in history, and then they go [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1157.9199999999998s)]
*  dormant for the next two or three hundred years or until the next forest fire. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1161.94s)]
*  The magic mushrooms got him through some pretty tough times. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1165.72s)]
*  We lived in a 300-foot square shack, turn of the century cabin, with no running water [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1169.96s)]
*  or electricity. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1175.1599999999999s)]
*  Were you warm enough in the wintertime? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1176.1599999999999s)]
*  Pretty well. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1178.44s)]
*  Your hair would get stuck to the back wall if it was 40 below. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1179.44s)]
*  When there was money to spare, Ryan could afford to do aerial surveys of charred forests. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1183.48s)]
*  He started researching soil quality, topography, and the contour of the land. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1189.6000000000001s)]
*  He found even more mushrooms and discovered that the same research that helped him find [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1195.1200000000001s)]
*  the morels could help him find gold. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1200.1200000000001s)]
*  I actually give a lot of credit to my gold discoveries based on the mushroom picking, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1203.2s)]
*  because I was able to understand scientifically the parameters of why these mushrooms grow [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1207.44s)]
*  up here and roughly how many is going to come out at each different fire. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1212.24s)]
*  Now you say that you come to a place like this and there are no mushrooms, but you have [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1216.0400000000002s)]
*  faith that they're going to pop up. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1220.76s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1222.24s)]
*  Must be quite a thrill. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1223.24s)]
*  Well, it is, and that's about the same thrill as predicting where gold is. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1224.24s)]
*  Sean Ryan says all the gold found in the rivers had to come from somewhere, most likely from [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1228.88s)]
*  the mountains, and that's where he's staked more than 50,000 claims. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1234.6s)]
*  He and his team walk the ridges and take soil samples they send to a lab for analysis. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1240.9199999999998s)]
*  Finding gold is always a long shot, and the unexpected can happen at any time. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1247.12s)]
*  Look, there's a bear right here. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1252.9199999999998s)]
*  Hey, hey. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1255.9199999999998s)]
*  Where's your bear spray? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1256.9199999999998s)]
*  Where's your bear spray? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1257.9199999999998s)]
*  Go, go, bear. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1258.9199999999998s)]
*  Hey. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1259.9199999999998s)]
*  Look at the dog guys in the hole. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1261.24s)]
*  Look at the bears trying to figure out, ooh, look at this. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1263.24s)]
*  Go get him, go get him. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1268.24s)]
*  Sean and his team lucked out with the bear. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1271.24s)]
*  All he has to do now is get lucky with the soil. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1276.24s)]
*  So the idea is that when we run these ridges... [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1280.0s)]
*  He taught himself how to study maps and surveys and how to use a computer to help evaluate [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1282.68s)]
*  his claim and try to find the hot spots. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1289.0800000000002s)]
*  The pinks are where the pay dirt is. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1291.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1293.64s)]
*  Okay, but what percentage of hot spots actually will give you gold? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1294.64s)]
*  I'd give that one in 10,000. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1298.2s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1300.96s)]
*  Because the probability, this is the only probability where the norm is to fail. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1303.4s)]
*  To better his odds, Ryan and his team use a drone that makes a detailed aerial survey [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1308.24s)]
*  of his claim. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1315.2s)]
*  They also send electrical charges 300 feet into the ground to get more precise physical [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1316.68s)]
*  data on where the gold might be located. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1322.72s)]
*  The images from the drone and the electric data help create a three-dimensional underground [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1328.52s)]
*  virtual map, which helps pinpoint where to go digging. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1334.0s)]
*  What are the odds that there's going to be gold there? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1337.92s)]
*  Extremely high. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1340.72s)]
*  Like, pretty well, I could almost guarantee gold. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1341.72s)]
*  Well, they got you with lots of samples. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1344.92s)]
*  Sean Ryan has become the biggest gold prospector in the Yukon and believes he's found seven [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1347.12s)]
*  million ounces of gold. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1352.68s)]
*  But he doesn't actually mine the gold himself. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1354.68s)]
*  He opts his claims to larger companies and keeps a royalty. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1357.64s)]
*  Ryan says he expects digging to begin in a few years. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1361.68s)]
*  Seven million ounces at today's gold prices, what would that be worth? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1366.08s)]
*  It's probably close to $10 billion. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1370.96s)]
*  $10 billion. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1372.92s)]
*  But that's not for you. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1374.28s)]
*  No. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1375.28s)]
*  Out of that, you'd only get one or two percent. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1376.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1378.44s)]
*  And what would that make? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1379.44s)]
*  It might be in the close to 100 million range. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1380.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's our arithmetic as well. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1382.72s)]
*  That's how your math is working. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1384.88s)]
*  It is math, but Sean Ryan says it's also a poker game, a game miners like because it's [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1386.88s)]
*  just another way of playing the odds. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1393.6000000000001s)]
*  If you play one blackjack game, the probability you're going to lose. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1396.16s)]
*  If you play 20, if I'm lucky, two or three are going to be a winner. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1400.28s)]
*  And that's enough. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1404.16s)]
*  And that'll pay for the moose pasture that I walked over and didn't find anything. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1405.16s)]
*  Moose pasture being where there was nothing. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1410.36s)]
*  Nothing, yeah, just swamp. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1412.04s)]
*  But it's actually in the moose pastures in the Caribou migration routes north of Dawson [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1414.04s)]
*  where the next gold rush could take place. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1419.04s)]
*  It's the Peel watershed and is believed to be rich in minerals. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1421.76s)]
*  The Peel is part of the Yukon, but you have to take a float plane to get there to the [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1428.2s)]
*  26,000 square miles of mountains and lakes that extend up to the Arctic Circle. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1433.24s)]
*  The government recently took the first steps to open most of the area to mining. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1440.36s)]
*  Environmentalists were furious. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1446.12s)]
*  So was wilderness entrepreneur Chris Widrick. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1448.7s)]
*  He takes hunters to shoot Caribou and the occasional grizzly. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1452.1599999999999s)]
*  One of those grizzlies nearly killed him and left him scarred for life. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1456.12s)]
*  How much territory would the miners mine? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1461.12s)]
*  Too much. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1463.96s)]
*  There's a frenzy, basically, you know, a gold frenzy. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1464.96s)]
*  It's all staked. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1468.34s)]
*  They can't get across the border right now, but, you know, I like they would like to. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1469.34s)]
*  To push back the miners, several groups have taken the government to court. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1474.32s)]
*  What is it about this place? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1478.96s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1480.76s)]
*  There's no roads for 100 miles. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1482.1599999999999s)]
*  There's no development. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1483.6799999999998s)]
*  There's no towns. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1484.74s)]
*  I think it's special, really. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1486.24s)]
*  In a replay of what once happened in America's Wild West, native Canadians called the First [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1488.4s)]
*  Nations are fighting to protect what was originally theirs. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1494.02s)]
*  Ed Champion is one of their chiefs. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1498.58s)]
*  Why do you feel so strongly about this? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1501.18s)]
*  Our people have been using this land, have been traversing it, using it for hunting, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1503.46s)]
*  fishing sustenance. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1508.26s)]
*  And, you know, for many of our people, it's been their university, it's been their church, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1509.26s)]
*  it's been, it's home, has been home. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1515.18s)]
*  And once you're opening up, what, 70% of the land to the government and what the government [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1517.66s)]
*  decides, you no longer have any control over what they do. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1525.38s)]
*  That's a major concern. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1529.16s)]
*  The biggest concern is that the wilderness return from this into this, an abandoned mine [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1531.46s)]
*  just south of the Peel watershed. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1537.72s)]
*  All it would take would be one road. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1540.6200000000001s)]
*  The mining companies promise that they'll leave it as pristine as they found it. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1542.6999999999998s)]
*  There's no such thing as pristine mine that's been abandoned. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1547.1799999999998s)]
*  Sean Ryan hopes the wilderness will be opened up for mining because it would create jobs. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1551.3799999999999s)]
*  But he's not going there. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1556.78s)]
*  He's too much in love with the mushrooms around Dawson and believes that this is where he [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1559.1s)]
*  might just find what men have been searching for in the Yukon for a hundred years. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1563.8999999999999s)]
*  There's still this elusive source of the Klondike. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1570.3s)]
*  The mother lode. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1572.66s)]
*  Yeah, and nobody's ever found that yet. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1573.66s)]
*  I'll tell you what keeps me up at night. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1575.46s)]
*  I fear to stop a mile short of the next ore deposit. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1577.26s)]
*  So that's what keeps me going. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1582.78s)]
*  And now after all this time, you still get a thrill. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1584.5s)]
*  I get so excited sometimes. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1589.18s)]
*  I feel like an eight-year-old on an Easter egg hunt. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1591.02s)]
*  You know, when you're out there and you find another Easter egg, well, there's another [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1595.74s)]
*  Easter egg to be found. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1598.94s)]
*  Archaeologists often spend years digging and hoping they'll find the remnants of ancient [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1609.94s)]
*  civilizations. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1615.3400000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of ground yet to be uncovered. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1616.94s)]
*  Archaeologist Sarah Parkak says less than 10 percent of the Earth's surface has been [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1619.78s)]
*  explored, so she's leading the way to speed up the search. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1624.82s)]
*  Parkak uses satellite photos to locate ancient sites, and she's finding them. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1629.7s)]
*  Thousands. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1636.1s)]
*  It's called space archaeology, and it's transforming the field. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1637.26s)]
*  We met Sarah Parkak in Egypt, doing what she loves most, digging in the dirt. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1642.02s)]
*  Our journey took us past the most famous archaeological site on Earth, the Pyramids [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1649.82s)]
*  of Giza, rising from the Egyptian desert. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1654.7s)]
*  Here and elsewhere, modern Egypt is built next to and often on top of ancient Egypt. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1658.1000000000001s)]
*  From Cairo, we traveled 40 miles south and almost 4,000 years back in time to the village [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1665.02s)]
*  of Lysht. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1671.54s)]
*  Today, the people of Lysht bury their dead in a cemetery at the edge of town, in the [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1672.54s)]
*  same place that ancient Egyptians buried their dead. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1677.66s)]
*  Every day I come to this site, and it just blows my mind. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1682.02s)]
*  This is just one tomb. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1686.3799999999999s)]
*  At the age of 38, Sarah Parkak is leading the excavation of a tomb that's 3,800 years [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1688.74s)]
*  old. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1695.54s)]
*  Were all of the tombs this elaborate? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1696.54s)]
*  No, no. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1697.78s)]
*  So this is special. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1698.78s)]
*  This is a big, rock-cut tomb of a wealthy Middle Kingdom official. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1699.78s)]
*  It's big. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1704.06s)]
*  We watched Parkak's team meticulously dig with trowels and brushes. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1706.56s)]
*  After three weeks of this, the tomb buried for millennia was slowly revealed. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1711.8799999999999s)]
*  Most of the discoveries were fragments of pots and inscribed stones. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1718.56s)]
*  That changed the morning we arrived. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1723.24s)]
*  Sarah, what is this? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1725.6s)]
*  What have you found? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1727.48s)]
*  So this is beautiful. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1728.48s)]
*  Oh, a hand. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1730.6s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1733.84s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1734.84s)]
*  You've got an arm there. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1736.12s)]
*  This is a limestone block that was part of this, probably part of this tomb. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1737.12s)]
*  So this is a big find. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1742.6s)]
*  It's a very big find. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1744.76s)]
*  It's the biggest find of our season. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1746.04s)]
*  The stone is part of a much larger slab. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1749.1599999999999s)]
*  Look closely and you can make out the lower half of a seated person and the hand of another. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1752.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1758.04s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1759.56s)]
*  Who's buried here was a mystery until Parkak's team solved it. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1761.1599999999999s)]
*  She took us to an alcove at the back of the tomb where they discovered this stone tablet [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1765.8s)]
*  with a name. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1770.8799999999999s)]
*  Intef, Intef. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1771.8799999999999s)]
*  Intef. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1773.44s)]
*  It describes a powerful man, head of the Pharaoh's treasury and overseer of his army. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1774.52s)]
*  Parkak showed us the tablet is damaged and she wondered whether Intef's enemies desecrated [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1780.96s)]
*  his tomb. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1786.48s)]
*  Was he corrupt? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1787.48s)]
*  Did he step on too many people on his way to the top? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1789.1599999999999s)]
*  Who was this guy? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1791.56s)]
*  What did he do? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1793.04s)]
*  But that's what makes archaeology interesting. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1794.28s)]
*  It's like you're reading the ancient version of the National Enquirer in slow time, right? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1796.72s)]
*  I often get asked, especially when we're excavating in tombs, don't you feel bad? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1801.6399999999999s)]
*  You're disturbing these people. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1807.52s)]
*  They wanted to be left alone. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1809.96s)]
*  Yes, that's true, but on the flip side, the ancient Egyptians, they wanted their names [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1811.56s)]
*  to be remembered. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1817.44s)]
*  And to let them move on. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1818.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1820.36s)]
*  And his mom and his children, you know, now the world knows them and knows who they are. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1821.6799999999998s)]
*  Once freed from the earth, the ancient slab was hoisted using ancient methods. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1831.1999999999998s)]
*  Local villagers do the heavy lifting. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1838.4399999999998s)]
*  The man in charge is Omar Farouk. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1840.52s)]
*  They call you Reyes. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1843.4799999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1844.4799999999998s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1845.4799999999998s)]
*  You call me Reyes, this means the chief. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1846.4799999999998s)]
*  You're the chief. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1849.1599999999999s)]
*  Archaeology has been the Farouk family business since the earliest digs in Egypt in the late [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1851.0s)]
*  19th century. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1855.48s)]
*  Omar's father, his grandfather and great grandfather oversaw digs like this one. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1857.36s)]
*  For him, there's pride in both the work and the connection to ancient civilization. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1863.2s)]
*  You know, you say you are a pharaonic people. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1868.88s)]
*  You are pharaonic people. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1870.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1871.84s)]
*  You're from the pharaohs. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1872.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1873.84s)]
*  And we think the pyramids were built by aliens. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1874.84s)]
*  Like all you have to do is watch these modern Egyptian men move a big stone. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1879.44s)]
*  That's it. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1884.04s)]
*  That's how the pyramids were built. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1885.04s)]
*  This is how they built the pyramids. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1887.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1889.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1890.44s)]
*  Using ramp systems, large groups of men moving stones. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1891.44s)]
*  It's not rocket science, as it were. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1895.28s)]
*  From the first pharaohs to the Roman conquest, ancient Egyptian civilization lasted more [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1897.72s)]
*  than 3,000 years. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1902.8s)]
*  Many of the most impressive artifacts are inside the famed Cairo Museum. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1905.08s)]
*  But Sarah Parkak, a well-known Egyptologist, is convinced most of ancient Egypt remains [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1910.3999999999999s)]
*  undiscovered. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1916.56s)]
*  Here, at Intef's tomb, she's digging for the main burial chamber. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1917.56s)]
*  Parkak is adept at this old-school archaeology, but she's ushering in a new school of the [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1923.56s)]
*  science. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1929.28s)]
*  She's making discoveries from 400 miles above the earth while sitting at her desk. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1930.4s)]
*  She gets infrared photos from Digital Globe, a commercial satellite company, and looks [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1936.3600000000001s)]
*  for shapes like circles and squares not usually found in nature and not easily visible on [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1941.76s)]
*  the ground that indicate human activity. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1947.88s)]
*  What have you found? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1951.1200000000001s)]
*  A lot. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1952.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm at the point where I can't keep track. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1953.1200000000001s)]
*  Parkak has found more than 3,000 ancient settlements in Egypt, Roman sites across Europe [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1958.08s)]
*  and North Africa, Viking sites in Iceland. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1963.76s)]
*  So we're going to look up here. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1966.56s)]
*  One of her early important finds was in a farm field near the ancient Roman city of [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1969.24s)]
*  Portis. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1974.36s)]
*  It's a site in Italy where archaeologists have been digging for a decade but hadn't [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1975.76s)]
*  been able to find the city's amphitheater until Sarah Parkak looked at the satellite [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1980.1599999999999s)]
*  photos. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1985.52s)]
*  What you see in this image are fields, but you can't really see much of anything. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1986.84s)]
*  Not much. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1993.06s)]
*  So we can go to the next image. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1994.06s)]
*  So if you see a circle right here, what you're looking at is the likely amphitheater of Portis. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=1996.76s)]
*  It's in that field. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2004.58s)]
*  How about that? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2005.8s)]
*  And from the surface you would see nothing? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2006.9599999999998s)]
*  Absolutely nothing walking over the top of it. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2008.8799999999999s)]
*  So your satellite sensors are not peering through the ground? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2011.04s)]
*  No. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2016.64s)]
*  You're looking for subtle variations on top of the ground. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2017.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2021.04s)]
*  So every site in the world is covered by different things, whether it's some kind of soil or [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2022.04s)]
*  sand or vegetation. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2025.48s)]
*  And all of those things are going to be affected in different ways by what's buried beneath [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2027.28s)]
*  the ground, depending on whether it's a ditch or a stone wall or a mud brick building. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2031.48s)]
*  So it's figuring out, it's puzzling out what's there, what's it made of. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2035.96s)]
*  Then and only then can you begin processing the image. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2040.08s)]
*  At the Portis farm field, that processing shows vegetation, colored orange, that's less [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2042.92s)]
*  healthy than the surrounding crop because of the stones that lie beneath. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2048.38s)]
*  Parcak teases out the underlying features that can't be seen with the naked eye using [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2053.04s)]
*  sophisticated digital editing. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2058.5s)]
*  It's like a souped up Photoshop. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2061.0s)]
*  Just look at this satellite photo of Egypt's ancient city of Tanis. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2063.7200000000003s)]
*  Parcak fine tunes the image to turn desert sand into a detailed map. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2068.36s)]
*  And the structures from a place called Medinet Mahdi seem to rise from the ground. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2074.6400000000003s)]
*  It almost is at the point where it feels like cheating, where you can see everything from [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2079.84s)]
*  hundreds of miles in space. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2082.94s)]
*  And it's like that everywhere. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2084.6400000000003s)]
*  Was this new technique welcomed by the community of archaeologists? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2086.2400000000002s)]
*  When my colleagues and I started finding not just one thing or two things, but thousands [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2091.36s)]
*  of things, I think our colleagues were skeptical. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2096.08s)]
*  How is it possible that you could be looking in this place that we've been looking for [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2099.12s)]
*  30 years and you're seeing thousands of things? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2103.6s)]
*  Now everyone's using it. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2108.88s)]
*  Sara Parcak now is making it possible for everyone to look for ancient sites through [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2111.92s)]
*  her new project, Global Explorer. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2117.12s)]
*  It's a website that invites armchair explorers to flip through satellite images of Peru. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2120.16s)]
*  Since it started in January, people have examined more than 11 million photos and may have found [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2126.3999999999996s)]
*  thousands of unknown sites. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2132.3199999999997s)]
*  The site in Egypt where Parcak is digging has been known to archaeologists for decades. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2135.68s)]
*  But when Parcak looked at satellite photos of the area, she saw what others didn't, signs [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2140.8799999999997s)]
*  of rampant looting. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2147.04s)]
*  You can actually see the holes dug by the looters from space. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2149.32s)]
*  Easily, easily. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2152.96s)]
*  They're very clear. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2153.96s)]
*  It's not like ambiguous blobbiness that you can see before and then after. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2155.2000000000003s)]
*  And there are over 800 of them here. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2159.6400000000003s)]
*  Over 800 of them. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2161.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2163.0s)]
*  This is the satellite photo of the area from 2010. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2164.0s)]
*  Here's the same location in 2013. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2167.6400000000003s)]
*  The dark spots are looting pits. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2171.2400000000002s)]
*  Everything spiked after the Arab Spring in 2011 as tourism plummeted and many of the [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2174.16s)]
*  sites were left unprotected. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2179.68s)]
*  The area was ravaged and after Parcak shared the photos with the Egyptian government, it [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2182.2799999999997s)]
*  asked her to excavate Intef's tomb to preserve and protect what remains. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2187.48s)]
*  There's one there. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2193.16s)]
*  It's tried one down there. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2194.52s)]
*  It didn't work. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2196.2s)]
*  Parcak showed us the looting pits seen from space are all around the ancient cemetery. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2197.8399999999997s)]
*  And she believes the fragments of bones and artifacts scattered around Intef's tomb are [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2203.9s)]
*  debris left behind by looters. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2209.2200000000003s)]
*  Do you think the looters have gotten most of the antiquities from these tombs already? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2212.14s)]
*  So it's this question, how long is a piece of string? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2216.94s)]
*  How much is left after thousands of years? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2219.6s)]
*  And we all know that looting is part of the human condition. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2222.78s)]
*  Many of these tombs were robbed in antiquity. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2225.62s)]
*  I'm never going to be able to tell you what was in a hole after the looters got there. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2228.26s)]
*  So these tombs have been looted since ancient times? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2233.06s)]
*  They have been. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2236.38s)]
*  It's not just a modern phenomenon? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2237.38s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2238.38s)]
*  It's been going on for thousands of years. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2239.38s)]
*  The objects stolen by modern looting can be bought from ritzy galleries, auction houses, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2241.2200000000003s)]
*  and through online sites like eBay. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2246.7400000000002s)]
*  Last November, the U.S. recovered these looted antiquities, including a child's sarcophagus [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2249.84s)]
*  and a mummified hand, and returned them to the Egyptian embassy. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2255.9s)]
*  There are among hundreds of objects that Egypt has repatriated from around the world. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2260.82s)]
*  Some go on display in a special exhibit at the Cairo Museum. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2266.2200000000003s)]
*  The most important thing for archaeological discovery is context. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2270.5800000000004s)]
*  Where did something come from? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2274.3s)]
*  Then you can begin to understand its function, its importance. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2276.5s)]
*  That's why for us as archaeologists, looting is such a huge problem because when an object [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2279.82s)]
*  is taken out of its original context, we don't know where it comes from. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2285.2200000000003s)]
*  We can't tell you anything about it aside from, well, it's a mummy or it's a statue, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2289.0s)]
*  but that's kind of it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2294.96s)]
*  The story doesn't get told. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2296.52s)]
*  Archaeology is methodical, hard work. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2299.72s)]
*  The dirt that's removed is carefully sifted for smaller pieces of stone, bone, and pottery. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2303.64s)]
*  Parcak assembled a team of specialists to eke out every last clue from what they find. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2310.36s)]
*  I always do four when I'm here. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2315.82s)]
*  Brexene Hummel and Bettina Bodder specialize in the jigsaw pieces of pots. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2318.24s)]
*  Amazingly, you can see the thumbprint from the person who made this one. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2323.9599999999996s)]
*  You're very close to the man or woman who made this. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2328.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2331.7599999999998s)]
*  How about that? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2332.7599999999998s)]
*  How do you feel now? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2333.7599999999998s)]
*  Just touching something that's thousands of years old is just, it's kind of electric. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2336.3999999999996s)]
*  That draws me close to this stuff because they have used it, they have made it, they [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2340.8799999999997s)]
*  have used it. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2346.7999999999997s)]
*  You touched it, now you're touching it. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2347.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2349.28s)]
*  That's what pulls you back every year, like the story is never finished, ever. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2350.28s)]
*  You find a little bit more and a little bit more and a little bit more. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2357.76s)]
*  Every year. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2360.5600000000004s)]
*  We saw the wonders of ancient Egypt emerging from the desert sand. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2361.7000000000003s)]
*  Sarah Parcak says imagine what more can be found peering down from space. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2366.2400000000002s)]
*  It's estimated that Italy is home to two-thirds of the world's cultural treasures. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2377.8s)]
*  Trouble is, the country's too broke to keep its historic ruins, churches, and monuments [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2386.1200000000003s)]
*  from crumbling to dust. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2392.1600000000003s)]
*  Italy's up to its neck in debt. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2394.48s)]
*  Taxes go unpaid, corruption in an overstuffed bureaucracy is rife. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2396.84s)]
*  But now some of its most treasured and endangered landmarks are being saved, not by the government, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2402.24s)]
*  but by a more respectable Italian institution, the fashion business. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2409.56s)]
*  As we reported last October, it stepped in to rescue some of Italy's most iconic sites, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2414.72s)]
*  among them the very symbol of its rich, violent, and inventive history, the Colosseum in Rome. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2421.16s)]
*  With its stunning, timeless sites, it's justifiably called the Eternal City, a holy place to billions, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2430.36s)]
*  a vast landscape of the sacred and profane, an architectural delight, especially when [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2438.36s)]
*  viewed at sunset. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2445.6800000000003s)]
*  And smack in the middle is the Colosseum, the greatest surviving wonder of the ancient [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2448.08s)]
*  world, a memorial to the rise, decline, and fall of Imperial Rome. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2452.6s)]
*  A place truly colossal. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2458.8s)]
*  We think it seats about 50,000 people, but this number depends on how wide you think [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2461.76s)]
*  the Roman behind was. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2466.6000000000004s)]

*  Small behinds, you calculate more. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2471.48s)]
*  This is the Temple of Venus in Rome. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2473.6800000000003s)]
*  Backsides aside, Professor Kimberly Bowes is the director of the American Academy in [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2475.44s)]
*  Rome and an expert on ancient Mediterranean history, who knows every inch of the Colosseum. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2480.96s)]
*  She's taking us to the very top level, far above where tourists tread, for a site that [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2489.68s)]
*  over the centuries very few people have seen firsthand. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2496.2s)]
*  The view is terrifying. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2500.0s)]
*  The view is extraordinary. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2503.4s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2504.4s)]
*  This is where the poor people sat. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2505.4s)]
*  You really get the scale of this building here, though. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2507.88s)]
*  Look how big this is. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2510.16s)]
*  Look how big this is. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2512.3199999999997s)]

*  The place was built by the hands of slaves in just 10 years, finished a mere half century [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2514.3199999999997s)]
*  after the crucifixion. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2520.96s)]
*  The performers here were gladiators, wild animals, even comedians. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2523.48s)]
*  I gather that this place was the entertainment center, the Broadway of its day. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2529.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2535.2s)]
*  In a way, the whole point is to produce marvels, to produce a spectacle that would have amazed [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2536.52s)]
*  the audience. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2544.56s)]
*  The people with the most power, the senators, are down at the bottom, and the people with [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2545.88s)]
*  the least power, the slaves and the women, are up at the top. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2549.64s)]
*  Women? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2553.84s)]
*  Women. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2554.84s)]
*  You don't want women to get too close to gladiators. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2555.84s)]
*  You have to keep them separate, because your greatest fear, you have two fears if you're [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2558.88s)]
*  a Roman man. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2562.84s)]
*  One is that your slave is going to kill you one day in your bed. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2564.12s)]
*  And your second fear is that your wife is going to run off with a slave like a gladiator. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2567.7599999999998s)]
*  This is what everyone's afraid of, so you've got to put the women up on the top. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2572.3199999999997s)]
*  So even though the gladiators were slaves, they were kind of the movie stars of the day. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2575.16s)]
*  They were. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2580.12s)]
*  And we turned to Hollywood for an idea of how it all might have looked. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2581.12s)]
*  There's a moment in Gladiator where Russell Crowe walks out right where we are. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2588.2s)]
*  Professor Bowes gives the filmmakers high marks for the historical accuracy of their [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2593.48s)]
*  computer recreation of the Colosseum. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2600.16s)]
*  The whole drama is really the reenactment of Roman conquest, the continual expansion [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2603.6s)]
*  of the empire. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2609.52s)]
*  Backstage was actually underground, the basement. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2610.52s)]
*  Until recently, this was just filled with dirt. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2614.12s)]
*  A labyrinth of corridors, dungeons for slaves, cages for animals, all brought from the far [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2616.52s)]
*  reaches of the empire. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2623.2s)]
*  And wooden elevators raised by ropes and pulleys leading to trap doors on the stage. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2625.44s)]
*  There's a wonderful scene in Gladiator where the tiger pops out of the floor. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2631.64s)]
*  This is exactly the kind of thing that would have been used to wow the audience. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2639.04s)]
*  Since the 18th century, the Roman Catholic Church has venerated the Colosseum as a symbol [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2644.32s)]
*  of the early Christian martyrs who were put to death for their beliefs. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2650.64s)]
*  Professor Bowes tells visitors there were indeed early Christians quietly executed elsewhere [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2655.84s)]
*  in Rome. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2662.32s)]
*  But as for the Colosseum... [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2663.32s)]
*  We have not one piece of evidence that any Christians were ever killed in this building. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2665.2000000000003s)]
*  Not one. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2671.12s)]
*  I think really interesting reasons for this. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2672.8399999999997s)]
*  If you take a group of people who by all accounts are extraordinarily brave in the face of certain [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2674.64s)]
*  death and you put them in this space and put them on display, who's everyone going to cheer [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2679.16s)]
*  for? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2683.72s)]
*  They're going to cheer for the Christians, right? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2684.72s)]
*  Because they sow such extraordinary bravery. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2686.8399999999997s)]
*  This is not a smart thing to do politically. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2688.48s)]
*  So I'm in the famous Colosseum. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2690.8399999999997s)]
*  Six million tourists a year visit here, snapping selfies and posing with granted gladiators [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2693.16s)]
*  who pass the time with cigarettes and cell phones. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2699.96s)]
*  The place has survived fires and earthquakes over the centuries. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2703.68s)]
*  Now there's a new crisis, finding the money to manage the crowds and keep up with basic [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2707.68s)]
*  maintenance. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2713.44s)]
*  The director of the Colosseum is Rosella Rea. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2714.44s)]
*  The money isn't there. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2719.64s)]
*  There's very little, totally inadequate funding, only 5% of what we need. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2721.48s)]
*  Too little money and from the Italian parliament, too much red tape. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2727.56s)]
*  A lot of people say the bureaucracy is so top heavy. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2733.0s)]
*  That's the reason why things don't get done. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2738.04s)]
*  Bureaucracy is not just heavy, it is extremely heavy and we are the first victims. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2742.08s)]
*  Bureaucracy for us is a killer. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2747.88s)]
*  But that scaffolding you saw earlier is a sign that help is on the way. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2750.0s)]
*  The Colosseum is getting a badly needed facelift with money from an unlikely source. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2754.92s)]
*  To prevent further ruin, a benefactor is spending an arm and a leg, $35 million, in a place [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2761.32s)]
*  where 2,000 years ago gladiators and slaves literally lost arms, legs and lives, all in [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2768.28s)]
*  the name of show business. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2776.96s)]
*  The benefactor is Diego De La Valle, a prominent Italian businessman who knows a lot about [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2779.16s)]
*  the business of showing. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2785.44s)]
*  De La Valle is CEO of Todd's, the luxury leather goods company. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2790.48s)]
*  Crafting stylish shoes and bags has long been an Italian specialty. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2795.3199999999997s)]
*  Having made his bundle, De La Valle decided to give some back to the state. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2800.64s)]
*  Why spend so much of your own money, millions upon millions, to fix this wreck? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2806.24s)]
*  Why not? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2814.64s)]
*  Well, I am Italian. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2816.08s)]
*  I am very proud to be Italian. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2819.24s)]
*  And there is a very famous Kennedy speech, no? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2821.9199999999996s)]
*  It's the moment that what is possible for us to do for our country, we need to do now. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2825.24s)]
*  The shoes that made De La Valle's fortune are assembled the old fashioned way, by hand, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2831.76s)]
*  stitch by stitch. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2837.96s)]
*  And the work he's funding at the Coliseum is also about as low-tech as it gets. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2840.1600000000003s)]
*  It's being cleaned literally inch by inch to get rid of centuries of caked on dust, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2846.28s)]
*  grime, air and auto pollution. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2851.76s)]
*  The stone is travertine, a kind of limestone. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2854.84s)]
*  No chemicals allowed, only purified water and elbow grease. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2858.44s)]
*  Days, weeks, months, years on end of scrubbing, built by hand, saved by hand. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2863.48s)]
*  How long is it going to take? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2872.0s)]
*  The Coliseum? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2873.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2874.28s)]
*  I think three years from now. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2875.28s)]
*  And what will it look like, do you think, when they're finished? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2877.12s)]
*  I am very curious. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2880.44s)]
*  To get some idea, we were shown a few sections that had been completely cleaned. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2882.2000000000003s)]
*  2,000 years old and looking almost brand new. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2887.72s)]
*  And in the world of high style, it's become fashionable to follow De La Valle's example. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2894.3599999999997s)]
*  An entire parade of fashionistas are bankrolling similar worthy causes. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2900.3599999999997s)]
*  The Fendi Fashion House donated $3.5 million for some new plumbing for a familiar waterworks. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2906.04s)]
*  It's the Trevi Fountain. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2915.6s)]
*  Marcello, come here. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2917.48s)]

*  In Fellini's La Dolce Vita, The Suite Life, forever linking Rome and romance. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2926.08s)]
*  This movie helped a lot to build really this powerful image of the Trevi Fountain. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2934.8s)]
*  Cinema has a big power. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2941.64s)]
*  Silvia Fendi's grandfather started the business 90 years ago. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2945.04s)]
*  And as we spoke, huge crowds had a last chance to throw in a coin before the closing of the [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2949.08s)]
*  site for repairs. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2956.0s)]
*  It means that you will be in good health to come in order to come back. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2958.0s)]
*  So it's very important for us. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2962.6s)]
*  This country gave us a lot. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2964.44s)]
*  And so it's nice at the point to give back something. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2966.52s)]
*  Elsewhere in Rome, the Bulgari Fashion House is paying to clean and repair the Spanish [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=2971.48s)]

*  No, I think we have to face with the reality. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=3011.08s)]

*  Diego De La Valle agrees. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=3101.16s)]

*  The old point of view was without any sense. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=3109.8399999999997s)]
*  I open the new point of view. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=3113.2799999999997s)]
*  I push for the new point of view. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=3115.12s)]
*  But as De La Valle's scrubbers continue their work, it's worth noting that his generous [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=3116.8399999999997s)]

*  This is the real challenge that Italy has. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=3132.36s)]
*  This is why sites are closed and monuments are falling down. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIeQH-kss6M&t=3134.4s)]
