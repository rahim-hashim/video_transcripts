*  Category four Hurricane Helene hit the west coast of Florida with a fury not seen since [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=0.0s)]
*  Hurricane Ian made landfall two years ago. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=12.32s)]

*  And now there are allegations that they're being cheated. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Faking the facts on a claim is not acceptable and there should be legal consequences for that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=24.36s)]
*  Vladimir Putin tried to poison him twice, then sent him to die in prison. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=33.480000000000004s)]

*  Will Putin try to kill you again? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=45.56s)]
*  Look, we know what it entails to be in opposition to Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=47.44s)]
*  He's not just a dictator. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=52.839999999999996s)]
*  He's not just an authoritarian leader. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=54.16s)]
*  He's not just a strong man. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  He is a murderer. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  That man is a murderer. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=57.879999999999995s)]

*  Yeah, felt good. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=65.88s)]
*  Caitlin Clark may be the WNBA's Rookie of the Year. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=67.2s)]
*  This is my off day. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=70.88s)]
*  You guys are putting me through a workout. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=72.2s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=73.44s)]
*  But the real breakthrough star this season is the league itself. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=74.32s)]
*  Home and away, you look into the crowds. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=78.44s)]
*  What are you seeing? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=80.08s)]
*  People, which is... [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=81.52s)]

*  Those stories and more tonight on this special 90-minute edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=97.92s)]
*  On Thursday night, Hurricane Helene and its 140-mile-an-hour winds made landfall in Florida's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=104.32s)]
*  Big Bend region. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  It was deadly. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  The full extent of the damage won't be known for weeks, and residents know rebuilding after [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  the storm is likely to be as daunting as the storm itself. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=126.0s)]
*  It's been two years since Hurricane Ian hit southwest Florida, and an estimated 50,000 [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=130.44s)]
*  homeowners are still locked in battles with their insurance companies. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=136.4s)]
*  Tonight, you will hear from insurance insiders who say after years of diligently paying premiums, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=140.6s)]
*  homeowners are being misled by their insurance carriers. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=148.12s)]
*  The whistleblowers, who are all licensed adjusters, tell us after Hurricane Ian, several insurance [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=151.76s)]
*  carriers were using altered damage reports to deceive customers. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=158.24s)]
*  As Hurricane Ian slammed into Florida with 150-mile-an-hour winds, Jeff Rapkin took this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=165.0s)]
*  video from the porch of his home, about 40 miles south of Sarasota. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  All the trees are coming down. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=176.68s)]
*  They don't normally look like this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=179.68s)]
*  My name is Jeff Rapkin. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=185.68s)]
*  I live in Northport, Florida. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=187.68s)]
*  Rapkin, an adoption attorney, and his wife Ginny raised three children in his home and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=189.68s)]
*  weathered more than a half dozen hurricanes inside it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=194.68s)]
*  But Ian, they say, was different. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=198.4s)]
*  It just sat above our heads. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=201.24s)]
*  It wouldn't move. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=203.08s)]
*  I mean, it was a nightmare. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=204.08s)]
*  And it went on for how long? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  Eleven hours. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=207.8s)]
*  Eleven hours. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=208.8s)]
*  It felt like the hurricane was inside the house. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=209.8s)]
*  We couldn't keep the windows closed. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=211.68s)]
*  That is the Rapkins' house, a neighbor just happened to be filming when their steel roof [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=214.6s)]
*  was ripped off. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=219.6s)]
*  When the storm finally passed, the Rapkins could see clear skies through the new hole [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=223.2s)]
*  Hurricane Ian punched in their ceiling. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=227.68s)]
*  There were trees on and around their house. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=230.76s)]
*  The roof was shredded, and everything inside was soaked. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=233.4s)]
*  The Rapkins lined up their losses on the curb and called their insurance company Heritage [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=237.68s)]
*  to begin the claims process. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=243.44s)]
*  It sent a licensed adjuster to the house to assess the damage. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=245.76s)]
*  Did you get the feeling, speaking to him and showing him around the property, that he understood [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  what was happening here, that this was serious? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  He was really nice, he was thorough, and he said the house is probably going to need to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=257.88s)]
*  be completely rebuilt. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=261.52s)]
*  Which is why the Rapkins were floored when they finally got a check from their insurance [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=263.52s)]
*  company three months later. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  They sent us a report from the adjuster which said that it would cost $15,000 to put our [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=270.08s)]
*  home back to pre-hurricane conditions. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  They sent you $15,000? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  $15,000, and so the deductible was taken out, so it was $10,000. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=279.47999999999996s)]
*  And then our public adjuster took $1,000 out, so we had nine. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=285.2s)]
*  When you called and said, $9,000, are you kidding me? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  What was the reaction? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=292.79999999999995s)]
*  The reaction was, this is the decision we've made, and I started to pray for Mr. Jordan [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=293.9s)]
*  Lee's untimely demise because I was so angry. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=301.26s)]
*  We found Mr. Jordan Lee very much alive. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=304.26s)]
*  Do you remember the Rapkins family? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=307.26s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=309.26s)]
*  Lee is the adjuster who went to the Rapkins home after the storm. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=310.26s)]
*  What do you remember about them? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=314.53999999999996s)]
*  Their property, a two-story home, metal roof that was blown off by Hurricane Ian, and the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=315.94s)]
*  interior of the home was just, it was soaked. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=323.5s)]
*  Jordan Lee has been a licensed adjuster in Florida since 2017. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=327.14s)]
*  After major disasters, most insurance companies use third-party firms who hire adjusters like [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=331.9s)]
*  Lee to help them with the thousands of claims. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  Lee says after he assesses a home, he always leaves his cell phone number with the homeowners [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=341.29999999999995s)]
*  so they can call him if they have any questions. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=346.5s)]
*  After Hurricane Ian, homeowners did. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=349.53999999999996s)]
*  What were they saying? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=352.1s)]
*  Cussing me out, left and right, up and down, you know, how could you do this to us? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=353.1s)]
*  It was really bad, actually, and out of the thousands of claims that I've handled, I've [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=357.26000000000005s)]
*  never had phone calls like that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=364.1s)]
*  Confused, he went back to compare the damage report he wrote for the Rapkins to the one [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=365.86s)]
*  the insurance company sent to them. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=371.38s)]
*  That's your work? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=373.98s)]
*  Correct. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=374.98s)]
*  And this is what they were given? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=375.98s)]
*  Totally different. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=378.82000000000005s)]
*  Totally different. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=380.22s)]
*  You said they needed a new roof? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=381.62s)]
*  I did. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=382.62s)]
*  And this report says what? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=383.62s)]
*  It reads as a repair. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=385.44000000000005s)]
*  Was that roof able to be repaired in your opinion? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=386.94000000000005s)]
*  Not in my opinion, no. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=389.62s)]
*  Later, Jordan Lee learned a desk adjuster who'd never been to the Rapkins home had deleted [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=391.5s)]
*  entire sections of his report but left his name and his license number on it, making [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=398.04s)]
*  it look like his work. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=403.98s)]
*  Did anybody ever alert you, hey, we're making a change to this report? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=406.04s)]
*  No, nobody told me. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=409.86s)]
*  The only way that I knew was the homeowner calling me. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=411.46s)]
*  It is standard procedure for field adjusters to collaborate with those back in the office [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=414.78s)]
*  to make minor edits. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=419.94s)]
*  But Jordan Lee says that is not what happened with the Rapkins report. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=421.7s)]
*  Did you put a dollar amount on how much you thought they were owed? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=426.7s)]
*  $231,368.57. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=430.38s)]
*  What did the insurance carrier come up with? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=435.62s)]
*  $15,469.48. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=438.98s)]
*  So quite a bit of difference. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=444.1s)]
*  That's not a difference of opinion? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=446.46000000000004s)]

*  off reports. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=533.8199999999999s)]

*  This was six carriers that we discovered were doing this in the state of Florida. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=542.26s)]
*  They all got the memo. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=546.94s)]
*  Which was? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=549.22s)]
*  Which was, we're not going to replace roofs, asphalt shingle roofs. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=550.46s)]
*  We're not going to replace them. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=555.1s)]
*  We're going to repair them. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=557.3800000000001s)]
*  Mandel says he refused to leave off roofs. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=559.5s)]
*  They were asking me to do something that was illegal. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=562.82s)]
*  And why was it illegal? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=566.72s)]
*  It's illegal because when I go out to make a damage estimate, I have to put what the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=567.98s)]
*  damage is, not what they want the damage to be. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=573.18s)]
*  And so if I leave something off that's supposed to be on there, I can be prosecuted for that. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=577.18s)]
*  So the company's telling you, leave the roofs off. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=582.6999999999999s)]
*  We're not paying for roofs. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=585.42s)]
*  But you keep writing these roofs. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=586.42s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=588.06s)]
*  I wrote the way they're supposed to be. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=589.06s)]
*  And you get fired. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=590.54s)]

*  Now, Ben Mandel and five other whistleblower adjusters are represented by attorney Stephen [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=592.6999999999999s)]
*  Bush. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=598.5s)]
*  Bush worked as a public adjuster for more than a decade. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=599.82s)]
*  What the carriers are doing, in some instances, what they've said was, if the policyholder [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=603.38s)]
*  needs a new roof, then we're going to make them make us pay. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=608.72s)]
*  In other words, file a lawsuit and then we'll pay you for your roof. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=613.2800000000001s)]
*  But unless they do that, they're not getting the roof paid for? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=617.5s)]
*  They're not getting it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=619.74s)]
*  They're not getting it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=620.74s)]
*  Most people will not stand up and fight. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=621.74s)]
*  I cannot tell you how many people come to me and say, hey, what was I going to do? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=623.4200000000001s)]
*  I had to replace my roof. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=627.6600000000001s)]
*  And do you think the insurance companies know that? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=629.54s)]
*  They're betting on that most people are just going to roll over? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=631.3399999999999s)]
*  No question they know that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=634.18s)]
*  They're playing the odds and they're winning. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=635.54s)]
*  Florida's insurance market has been a risky gamble for years. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=638.3s)]
*  After a decade of costly storms, several national carriers exited Florida. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=642.3399999999999s)]
*  Smaller regional carriers stepped in, but not all were up to the job. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=648.14s)]
*  Since 2021, at least nine insurance companies in Florida have collapsed and some of the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=652.9s)]
*  remaining ones, Stephen Bush says, altered damage reports. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=658.54s)]
*  And is it just in Florida? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=663.14s)]
*  I now have evidence in six different states of where carriers are manipulating the estimates, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=664.42s)]
*  changing them and then misrepresenting to policyholders that it's the work product of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=672.3s)]
*  the field adjuster. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=676.54s)]
*  And do most times the policy owner have any idea? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=678.1s)]
*  Policy owner has no clue. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=681.22s)]
*  There's almost no transparency in the claims process. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=682.5s)]
*  Doug Quinn is the executive director of the American Policyholders Association, an advocacy [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=686.02s)]
*  group he started after his home was destroyed by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=691.62s)]
*  The victims of insurer fraud are the last people to find out that they were victims [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=697.22s)]
*  of insurer fraud. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=702.18s)]
*  So when the insurance carriers say, look, it's all right, we're allowed to go back in [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=703.46s)]
*  there and do what we want to these adjuster reports, you would say. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=706.5799999999999s)]
*  You're not allowed to take somebody who has dutifully paid premiums for years. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=710.62s)]
*  And when they need their insurance, cheat them and shave 70, 80 or 90 percent off their [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=716.02s)]
*  claim. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=723.38s)]
*  You are not allowed to do that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=724.38s)]
*  You are allowed to disagree with, you know, the minutiae. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=725.38s)]
*  But coming in to that degree and faking the facts on a claim is not acceptable. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=728.1s)]
*  And there should be legal consequences for that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=735.26s)]
*  If you really want to see change in the industry, put somebody in handcuffs. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=737.7s)]
*  Bernie Steven Bush says he turned over what he says is evidence of insurer fraud to state [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=741.82s)]

*  Contractors and public adjusters, everybody who's aligned with the consumer who costs [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=760.7s)]
*  the insurance industry money. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=765.74s)]
*  Those cases get investigated and prosecuted rather quickly and aggressively. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=767.82s)]
*  All we are asking is that cases that are alleged to be perpetrated by the insurance carriers [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=773.5400000000001s)]
*  or the vendors that they hire are just as aggressively investigated and prosecuted when [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=779.5400000000001s)]
*  fraud is found. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=785.5s)]
*  Quinn says it's difficult to know how many policyholders may have been given less money [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=786.62s)]
*  than they were owed. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=791.7s)]

*  The Russian opposition leader had warned for years that Vladimir Putin would threaten the [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=919.22s)]
*  peace of the world. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=924.78s)]
*  And at the UN General Assembly in New York this past week, leaders were debating how [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=926.74s)]
*  to stop Putin in Ukraine without a world war. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=931.5s)]
*  Putin poisoned Kara-Mursa twice, then sent him to die in prison. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=935.98s)]
*  But last month he was traded for a prize that Putin could not resist. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=941.3s)]
*  Why does the Russian dictator still fear Vladimir Kara-Mursa? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=947.14s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=951.7s)]
*  I think Russia deserves so much better than to live under a corrupt, repressive, criminal, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=953.78s)]
*  archaic, KGB-led dictatorship. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=962.02s)]
*  Change is not going to happen unless we do something to make it happen. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=965.38s)]
*  And this is worth your life? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=969.22s)]
*  I mean, look, there were people who stood up to apartheid in South Africa. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=972.22s)]
*  There were people who stood up to the communist regime in the Soviet Union. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=977.4599999999999s)]
*  There were people who stood up to the Nazi regime in Germany. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=980.42s)]
*  There are causes larger than ourselves. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=983.18s)]
*  And to me, the cause of a free, peaceful, civilized and democratic Russia is certainly [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=986.58s)]
*  much larger than I could ever be. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=992.78s)]
*  He has fought for that cause from the start of Putin's 25 years in power. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=996.52s)]
*  He's a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The Washington Post and Cambridge-educated [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1003.38s)]
*  historian. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1008.78s)]
*  Last year, 43-year-old Kara-Mursa was tried for treason after denouncing Putin's war [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1010.38s)]
*  on Ukraine. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1017.18s)]
*  We try to warn the world. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1018.5s)]
*  We try to shout. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1020.38s)]
*  We try to get the message out that this regime is dangerous, that this man is dangerous, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1021.9399999999999s)]
*  that even if you don't care about what happens to us in Russia, it's going to come to you [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1027.14s)]
*  sooner or later. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1031.06s)]
*  What is it like living in Russia today? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1032.38s)]
*  Anybody who is a genuine opponent of Putin is either in exile, in prison, or dead. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1034.74s)]
*  You have to think about even what you talk to your kids about at home, because children [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1043.38s)]
*  whose families are against this war in Ukraine would, for example, draw antiwar images in [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1049.34s)]
*  school and their parents will get visits from the police, or they would be put in prison. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1055.38s)]
*  You have to think about that as well if you live in Russia today. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1060.5s)]
*  Vladimir Kara-Mursa has been high on Putin's list since 2012, when he and the late Senator [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1063.38s)]
*  John McCain fought for the so-called Magnitsky Act. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1070.3400000000001s)]
*  The U.S. law is named for a man murdered by Putin's police. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1075.1000000000001s)]
*  The Magnitsky Act seized the overseas assets of more than 60 people who abused human rights [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1079.98s)]
*  in Russia. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1087.1000000000001s)]
*  Kara-Mursa says this is why he was poisoned by Kremlin assassins. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1088.58s)]
*  I was in a coma for about a month the first time this happened in May of 2015, with multiple [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1094.9399999999998s)]
*  organ failure, and as the doctors in Moscow were telling my wife, with about a 5% chance [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1099.6599999999999s)]
*  to survive. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1105.9399999999998s)]
*  And after I came out of that coma, despite all the odds, I've literally had to learn [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1107.62s)]
*  everything I knew. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1112.4199999999998s)]
*  You had to learn to walk again. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1113.78s)]
*  You had to learn to eat again. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1116.9s)]
*  It's amazing how fast the human body just loses everything, just loses all the strength, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1119.74s)]
*  and you just have to start anew. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1127.3400000000001s)]
*  Two years later, he was poisoned again. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1129.66s)]
*  This time, 2017, he rehabbed in the U.S. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1133.5400000000002s)]
*  His wife and three children live in the states, and Kara-Mursa has permanent resident status. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1138.18s)]
*  But once he recovered, he returned to Russia. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1145.14s)]
*  You were safe. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1148.6200000000001s)]
*  How could I not go back to Russia? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1149.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm a Russian politician. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1151.5s)]
*  A politician has to be in their own country. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1153.46s)]
*  How could I call on my fellow citizens, on my fellow Russians to stand up and oppose [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1156.8600000000001s)]
*  this dictatorship if I myself was too scared to do it? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1161.8600000000001s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1165.3400000000001s)]
*  Last year, after his treason conviction, he was hit with the longest sentence ever for [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1166.9s)]
*  a political prisoner. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1172.74s)]
*  The judge in the case had been among the first officials ever sanctioned by the Magnitsky [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1174.58s)]
*  Act. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1180.9399999999998s)]
*  And when you heard the sentence, 25 years, you thought what? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1183.06s)]
*  So frankly, I thought, it's a job well done. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1187.82s)]
*  Job well done? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1190.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, on my part, yes. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1191.3799999999999s)]
*  I think that 25-year sentence was frankly a recognition that what we did over all those [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1192.82s)]
*  years mattered, that the Magnitsky Act mattered, that public opposition to the war in Ukraine [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1198.02s)]
*  mattered. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1201.98s)]
*  He was sent to Siberia and solitary confinement. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1203.02s)]
*  In the two and a half years I've spent in Russian prison, I was only able to once call [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1206.82s)]
*  my wife on the phone, and only twice I was able to speak on the phone to our three kids. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1211.18s)]
*  It was a 15-minute call, so five minutes per child. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1215.54s)]
*  And as my wife later told me, she was standing there with a stopwatch to make sure that each [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1218.38s)]
*  of our kids doesn't get more than five minutes so that everybody could have an opportunity [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1223.94s)]
*  to speak with that. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1227.28s)]
*  Were you sitting in that cell thinking, I'm going to get out of here one day? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1228.82s)]
*  No, to answer your question honestly, I did not believe I would ever get out. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1232.3000000000002s)]
*  And so what happened on August 1st, the only way I can describe that is a miracle. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1235.6200000000001s)]
*  The miracle was in the making for more than a year. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1241.0600000000002s)]
*  Negotiations began over Americans held by Putin, which eventually included Eben Gershkovich, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1244.6200000000001s)]
*  a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1252.1000000000001s)]
*  But over the months, the deal grew to involve seven countries. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1254.5s)]
*  We don't trust the Russians on anything. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1259.24s)]
*  They lied about the war in Ukraine. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1261.7s)]
*  They make a regular practice of lying and obfuscating. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1264.06s)]
*  But one thing they have shown over time is when they say they're going to do an exchange, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1267.1200000000001s)]
*  they do the exchange. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1271.94s)]
*  At the center of the negotiations was Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1273.3400000000001s)]
*  advisor. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1278.8600000000001s)]
*  None of this happens overnight. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1279.8600000000001s)]
*  None of it's straightforward. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1281.18s)]
*  There's going to be twists and turns. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1282.18s)]
*  There's going to be false starts. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1283.98s)]
*  And so persistence, relentlessness, that's part of the name of the game of actually securing [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1285.94s)]
*  the release of these Americans. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1291.44s)]
*  But there was only one thing Putin wanted, and that would be hard, maybe impossible, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1294.1000000000001s)]
*  for the man who held the key, the leader of Germany. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1300.56s)]
*  Olaf Scholz was absolutely critical. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1304.64s)]
*  Without him, this would not have happened, because a central piece of the puzzle was [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1308.3400000000001s)]
*  the release of a Russian agent named Vadim Krasikov. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1314.16s)]
*  Without Krasikov, there is no deal. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1319.8s)]
*  But Krasikov is a notorious assassin and friend of Putin. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1322.12s)]
*  In 2019, he was sent to Germany to kill an enemy of the Kremlin. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1327.24s)]
*  The daytime murder in the middle of Berlin was infamous. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1332.12s)]
*  What was Scholz's dilemma? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1337.3s)]
*  Being able to look his people in the eye and say, we are releasing someone who has committed [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1339.12s)]
*  a grievous crime on German soil, and therefore I can deliver something for the people of [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1344.6s)]
*  Germany. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1350.76s)]
*  And that's why we ended up thinking through enlarging the problem, not just trying to [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1351.76s)]
*  bring out Americans, but of course bring out some German citizens as well. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1357.7199999999998s)]
*  And then the critical move of being able to say to the German people, the American people [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1362.4399999999998s)]
*  in the world, we are also getting Russian freedom fighters out, including people like [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1367.9599999999998s)]
*  Vladimir Karamurza. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1372.32s)]
*  That was the fireside pitch to the German leader. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1374.58s)]
*  But Krasikov had served only three years of a life sentence. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1377.6999999999998s)]
*  Scholz's fractious coalition government faced election challenges, and the easy answer was [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1382.3s)]
*  no. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1388.6999999999998s)]
*  In the end, you had to do a deal with the devil. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1389.6999999999998s)]
*  I made a deal with the Russian president. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1392.5s)]
*  In Berlin, Chancellor Scholz told us he was brought to yes by a man he considered a friend. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1395.58s)]
*  It is not an easy decision. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1402.42s)]
*  And I discussed with many people in my government and especially with Joe Biden, who asked me [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1405.64s)]
*  to help. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1413.5s)]
*  And my view was that this is something which we could do well prepared and if we do it [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1414.5s)]
*  on a large scale. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1422.8200000000002s)]
*  He said, and I remember it very vividly on the phone with President Biden, for you, Joe, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1424.5s)]
*  I will do this. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1430.08s)]
*  A large group of officers burst into my cell. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1432.54s)]
*  I have no idea what's happening. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1436.6799999999998s)]
*  It's the middle of the night. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1437.6799999999998s)]
*  It's dark. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1438.6799999999998s)]
*  And they tell me I have 10 minutes to get up and get ready. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1440.12s)]
*  And at this moment, I'm absolutely certain that I'm going to be let out and be executed. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1444.0s)]
*  But instead of executed, on August 1st, eight Russian criminals and spies were traded for [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1447.8799999999999s)]
*  several Germans, the three Americans and eight Russian dissidents. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1455.16s)]
*  As he stepped off the plane in Turkey, Kara Mirza's captors had parting advice. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1461.3000000000002s)]
*  He turned to me and said, be careful about what you eat. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1467.44s)]
*  You know how these things happen. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1471.16s)]
*  He was telling you you might be poisoned again, even though you're free. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1472.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, look, we know that attacks on opponents of the crown have happened far beyond the [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1476.72s)]
*  borders of Russia. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1481.7s)]
*  The next voice Kara Mirza heard spoke not of fear, but of freedom. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1483.24s)]
*  At that moment, a lady diplomat came up to me with a cell phone and she says, are you [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1488.92s)]
*  Mr. Kara Mirza? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1493.6000000000001s)]
*  I said yes. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1494.6000000000001s)]
*  And she gives me the phone and says, I'm from the American Embassy in Ankara. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1495.6000000000001s)]
*  The president of the United States is on the line. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1499.24s)]
*  You've been wrongfully detained for a long time and we're glad you're home. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1501.4s)]
*  With President Biden was Kara Mirza's family. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1506.72s)]
*  We're in the Oval Office. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1509.8s)]
*  He's done a wonderful thing by saving so many people. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1511.76s)]
*  I think there are 16 of us on the plane. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1513.6s)]
*  I don't think there are many things more important than saving human lives. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1515.52s)]
*  It felt surreal. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1519.6s)]
*  It felt more emotional than I had ever felt at any point in my life. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1520.6s)]
*  There had been many emotions for Jake Sullivan, who for years could tell desperate families [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1526.4s)]
*  only to keep waiting. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1532.78s)]
*  And most of the time, as you can imagine, those are tough conversations. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1535.22s)]
*  But not today. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1538.96s)]
*  Today, excuse me. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1539.96s)]
*  Today was a very good day. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1545.56s)]
*  You know, it's one thing to speak about protecting freedom or protecting human rights, but it's [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1548.32s)]
*  quite another thing to actually do something to protect them. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1553.56s)]
*  And whatever else President Biden and Chancellor Schultz will be remembered for years from [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1558.44s)]
*  now, they will be remembered for this. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1563.4s)]
*  Vladimir Kara Mirza told us he quoted a Jewish scripture to you. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1566.48s)]
*  He who saves one life saves the entire world. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1572.48s)]
*  It was very nice to hear it, to be very honest with you. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1578.88s)]
*  On the other hand, I don't feel that great. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1584.58s)]
*  I did what I thought is the right thing to do. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1587.88s)]
*  We have traveled quite a bit through Ukraine. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1592.48s)]
*  We have seen the destroyed hospitals. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1594.74s)]
*  We have seen the shattered schools. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1597.04s)]
*  We have seen the mass graves. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1599.1s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has attacked a country that meant him no harm. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1601.66s)]
*  And I wonder if you can explain why. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1606.14s)]
*  Because that is what dictators do. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1608.66s)]
*  Once they consolidate, they control domestically. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1611.06s)]
*  Once they eliminate and destroy all the opposition at home, they start moving against others. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1614.14s)]
*  This has always happened in Russia. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1620.82s)]
*  Under the Tsars, under the Soviets, or now under Vladimir Putin. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1622.22s)]
*  Will Putin try to kill you again? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1627.22s)]
*  Look, we know what it entails to be in opposition to Vladimir Putin. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1629.22s)]
*  He's not just a dictator. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1635.46s)]
*  He's not just an authoritarian leader. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1636.8600000000001s)]
*  He's not just a strongman. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1638.58s)]
*  He is a murderer. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1639.58s)]
*  That man is a murderer. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1640.58s)]
*  Vladimir Kara Mirza remains in the U.S. with his family. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1642.06s)]
*  He told us in solitary confinement he learned there's no life without hope. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1647.1s)]
*  True for those behind bars and for his imprisoned country. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1653.74s)]
*  The amazing fact and the fact that frankly makes me proud of Russia is that there are [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1659.6s)]
*  thousands of people in Russia who have publicly spoken out against Putin's regime, who have [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1665.62s)]
*  against the war in Ukraine, even at the cost of personal freedom. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1673.08s)]
*  And I hope that when people in the West, when people in the United States, when people in [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1678.52s)]
*  the free world at large think about Russia, they will remember not only the aggressors [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1681.84s)]
*  and the war criminals who are sitting in the Kremlin, but also those who are standing up [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1687.98s)]
*  to them because we are Russians too. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1692.8999999999999s)]
*  How Vladimir Kara Mirza won the Pulitzer Prize from prison in Russia. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1699.92s)]
*  The Russian authorities let you write for the Washington Post. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1704.64s)]
*  At 60minutesovertime.com. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1708.14s)]
*  In June of 1984, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson met in the NBA finals for the first time. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1718.14s)]
*  The following week, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Elishawan and Charles Barkley were drafted, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1723.9s)]
*  and the league would never be the same. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1728.16s)]
*  Forty years later, the WNBA arrives at a similar hinge point. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1730.68s)]
*  A rookie class as good as advertised has made a seamless transition from college to the [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1734.72s)]
*  pros, blending with established stars. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1739.44s)]
*  Sports have a knack for bending stats to fit desired narratives, but the W's growth figures [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1742.84s)]
*  astound. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1747.66s)]
*  TV ratings have spiked 153% from last season, and that's before the playoffs, which began [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1748.96s)]
*  last week. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1754.56s)]
*  Gradually, then suddenly, this 27-year-old league has become a prominent player in the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1755.96s)]
*  modern sportscape. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1760.6s)]
*  Never mind her slick drives and traffic, the dead-eye passes, the three-pointers like this. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1763.6s)]
*  A few weeks ago in Indianapolis, we asked Kaitlyn Clark to pinpoint the signature moment [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1786.28s)]
*  of this signature season, and well, we didn't see this coming, but neither did she. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1793.52s)]
*  Then again, maybe it's fitting, as this is the season the WNBA lowered its shoulder, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1815.56s)]
*  made its presence felt, and expanded its reach. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1836.9199999999998s)]
*  These fans came to central Indiana from Newfoundland, Canada? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1841.46s)]
*  Clark, 22 in number and in age, just led the fever to the playoffs. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1849.58s)]
*  She's unquestionably the league's main attraction. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1854.22s)]
*  But not the only one. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1857.44s)]
*  Another rookie, Angel Reese, made her mark too. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1859.38s)]
*  But the real breakthrough star of this WNBA season is the W itself. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1865.9s)]
*  Starting off a college season in which, unimaginable just a few years ago, the women's championship [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1871.1s)]
*  game outdrew the men's, W games can draw more eyeballs than NBA games do. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1876.3s)]
*  Leaguewide attendance is up 48 percent. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1883.6999999999998s)]
*  In Minnesota, Nathisa Collier is this season's defensive player of the year. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1887.6599999999999s)]
*  She just dropped 80 points in the first two playoff games. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1894.78s)]
*  Collier was drafted in 2019 and bridges two eras of the WNBA. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1898.62s)]
*  We asked her about the difference this year. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1903.7399999999998s)]
*  Home and away, you look into the crowds. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1905.9799999999998s)]
*  What are you seeing? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1907.54s)]
*  People which is what we want. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1909.2199999999998s)]
*  It makes the game so, so fun. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1911.62s)]
*  It's like you're six man when you're at home and then when you're away you just can't [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1913.3s)]
*  wait to silence the crowd and that's like the best feeling ever. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1916.1s)]
*  You figured out a way to benefit from a full crowd even when it's rooting against you. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1918.6599999999999s)]
*  It's almost more fun when you're like in a packed arena with the other team and you [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1923.02s)]
*  hit like a big three or a big block or something and you hear them all go, oh, that's, I love [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1927.7s)]
*  that feeling. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1932.98s)]
*  Collier defending on Jones. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1933.98s)]
*  That's every bit as motivating. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1936.98s)]
*  It really is. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1938.8200000000002s)]
*  Silencing crowds, not an issue when the WNBA debuted in 1997. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1940.02s)]
*  Eight teams paired with eight existing NBA teams. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1945.1000000000001s)]
*  From the jump, franchises came and went. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1948.8600000000001s)]
*  The Houston Comets won the first four titles only to fold. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1951.8200000000002s)]
*  But amid the instability, the WNBA was giving a generation of girls aspiration and inspiration. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1956.28s)]
*  When Clark was growing up in Iowa, already running circles around the boys, her dad took [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1963.52s)]
*  her to see a WNBA game in Minnesota. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1968.28s)]
*  She returned home hell bent on adding distance to her jump shot. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1971.44s)]
*  Like begging my dad to like tear up some grass and pour more concrete so I could have an [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1975.24s)]
*  entire three point line in my driveway. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1979.54s)]
*  Did that really happen? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1981.08s)]
*  You extended your range by dumping more concrete. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1982.48s)]
*  Because it was like kind of slanted. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1985.48s)]
*  Our driveway was like slanted so we only had a three point line on one side of the driveway. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1986.48s)]
*  So I told my dad he had to tear up all this grass and he did. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1990.2800000000002s)]
*  Likewise, her fever teammate, six foot five center Leah Boston, last season's rookie of [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1994.48s)]
*  the year, had grand ambitions. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=1999.5600000000002s)]
*  So when I first picked up a basketball, at first I was like I want to go to college and [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2001.8200000000002s)]
*  that was really my goal. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2005.5600000000002s)]
*  Until probably about sophomore year I was like yeah, everything I do is for the number [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2006.92s)]
*  one pick. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2010.24s)]
*  I love that. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2011.24s)]
*  When you went to WNBA that became like a secondary goal at some point. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2012.6s)]
*  You wanted to be the number one pick. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2015.52s)]
*  I wanted to be the number one pick. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2016.52s)]
*  She was. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2018.28s)]
*  Then this spring came Clark, Reese, Cameron Brink and the 2024 vintage. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2019.28s)]
*  Did you have the level of confidence that this draft class seems to? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2025.04s)]
*  I don't think anybody has the level of confidence this draft class does. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2029.48s)]
*  I think that's what's so amazing about them actually is they don't act like rookies. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2034.72s)]
*  It feels like nothing gets them down and I think that's amazing. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2038.32s)]
*  Not a lot of imposter syndrome. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2040.24s)]
*  Not a lot, no. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2042.24s)]
*  New confidence, old school hoops. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2043.76s)]
*  This is the league of choice for the basketball purist, all passing and precision. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2046.48s)]
*  Stewart to Jones, Vander Sluyt had some time. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2051.24s)]
*  Obviously the men are really fun, they're very athletic, they can dunk and all those [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2056.4s)]
*  things but if you're a true fan of basketball I think that ours is really interesting because [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2059.4s)]
*  we play it the right way, we play it really smart. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2063.44s)]
*  Our season is shorter also so we go a lot harder I think in our games. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2066.88s)]
*  12 teams of 12 players, 144 of the world's best. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2071.32s)]
*  Aja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces, the league's reigning champs, is a three-time MVP, including [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2076.72s)]
*  this season. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2082.52s)]
*  Her game equal parts grace and power. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2083.52s)]
*  Oh the footwork, that's pretty. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2087.04s)]
*  And there's the OG, Diana Tarassi. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2090.7599999999998s)]
*  She's still doing this in her early 40s. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2093.16s)]
*  A lot of these players are who I grew up watching on TV and wanting to be like and now I get [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2099.2s)]
*  to play against them. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2103.8399999999997s)]
*  Now they're guarding you on the perimeter. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2104.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty cool. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2105.8399999999997s)]
*  Clark herself already has a trademark shot, a jumper from just inside mid-court. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2107.6s)]
*  The logo three. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2115.2s)]
*  Are you guys going to make me shoot in these nice clothes? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2117.04s)]
*  We got confidence in you. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2119.6s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2121.2s)]
*  I'm not warmed up either. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2122.24s)]
*  I only shoot from back there in games if I've made a couple. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2123.24s)]
*  Then you get a free pass to launch along three. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2126.16s)]
*  So that's a free pass with the coach or that's a free pass with yourself with your own basketball [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2128.8799999999997s)]
*  values? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2133.08s)]
*  Both. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2134.08s)]
*  What would you say your range is? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2135.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2136.08s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like I'm closer than I am. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2137.08s)]
*  I don't feel that far back, especially in a game. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2139.64s)]
*  I don't know, I kind of just lose sight of where I actually am, which is probably a [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2141.4399999999996s)]
*  good thing. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2144.8399999999997s)]
*  But you know you're one dribble past mid-court sometimes. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2145.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, a couple dribbles past mid-court. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2148.12s)]
*  Part of her process? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2150.6s)]
*  Gauging the distance. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2151.6s)]
*  This isn't like shooting a free throw. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2153.2799999999997s)]
*  Logos vary court to court. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2157.8399999999997s)]
*  I would always want to see how big the logo is because some people have bigger logos [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2159.64s)]
*  at center court, some have smaller ones. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2163.64s)]
*  If it's pretty big I can usually get there. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2165.88s)]
*  I can probably get it here from here. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2167.36s)]
*  Alright. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2168.7599999999998s)]
*  But I'm not... [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2169.7599999999998s)]
*  Do you want me to try? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2170.7599999999998s)]
*  Back to the... [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2171.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay, but you have to try second. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2172.7599999999998s)]
*  Alright. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2175.16s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2176.16s)]
*  Alright. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2177.16s)]
*  Alright. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2178.72s)]
*  This is my off day. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2179.72s)]
*  You guys are putting me through a workout. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2182.72s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2184.72s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2185.72s)]
*  I didn't... [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2186.72s)]
*  Oh, sign it up for this. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2187.72s)]
*  There we go. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2188.72s)]
*  The bottom of the net success has changed the W's balance sheets. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2189.72s)]
*  Corporate sponsors have arrived. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2195.04s)]
*  Everybody, everybody, everybody is wearing skims. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2197.04s)]
*  So have the celebrities. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2200.24s)]
*  The league recently signed a media rights deal that will pay $200 million a season, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2202.16s)]
*  more than a three-fold increase. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2206.84s)]
*  Kathy Engelberg is WNBA commissioner. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2210.88s)]
*  The Caitlin Clark phenomenon. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2213.52s)]
*  How do you describe it? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2214.52s)]
*  She's clearly an unbelievable player, came in with an unbelievable following, has brought [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2215.92s)]
*  a lot of new fans to the league. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2221.2000000000003s)]
*  If you look at our historic season around, our attendance, our viewership, Caitlin, Angel [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2222.8s)]
*  II, Angel Reese, Rekia Jackson, Cameron Brink, this class of rookies, we will be talking [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2229.44s)]
*  about them a generation from now. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2235.08s)]
*  I notice when you're asking about Caitlin a lot, you bring up other rookies as well. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2236.96s)]
*  No league's ever about one player. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2241.4s)]
*  That player could get hurt or whatever. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2242.72s)]
*  So I think it's just to give recognition that in sports, people watch for compelling content [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2244.24s)]
*  and rivalries and you can't do that alone as one person. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2249.64s)]
*  Though the commissioner touts league rivalries, competition has also brought out a certain [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2253.2799999999997s)]
*  ugliness. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2257.88s)]
*  This season saw an onslaught of vitriol, often racist, targeting players. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2259.24s)]
*  In a league that is 75% black, there's no place for that in our sport. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2264.24s)]
*  Here's veteran star Brianna Stewart earlier this month welcoming new fans, but demanding [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2269.2799999999997s)]
*  they act respectfully. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2274.12s)]
*  A happier earmark of growth. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2275.64s)]
*  The WNBA announced plans to expand from 12 teams to 16 and for the first time this season, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2278.92s)]
*  players travel on charter flights. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2285.96s)]
*  I mean, that's amazing. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2288.04s)]
*  I miss my points a little bit. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2289.04s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2290.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, your miles, your air miles. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2291.8799999999997s)]
*  I miss my little points. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2292.8799999999997s)]
*  No delta miles, but it's okay. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2294.6s)]
*  I think this is great too, especially for recovery. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2295.6s)]
*  You're able to get back on that plane, get right back home after a game. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2297.8s)]
*  The women that came before us, it's like, this is because of you guys. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2301.2400000000002s)]
*  You guys worked all this and now here we are. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2304.92s)]
*  We're able to step into that and it's a blessing for us. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2307.2000000000003s)]
*  Nafisa Collier recalls the old days on the road, staying two-door room. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2310.2400000000002s)]
*  We used to have to stay in the team-accredited hotels and now we can stay wherever. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2315.0s)]
*  So a lot more five-star hotels was just nice. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2319.08s)]
*  Five-star hotels, flying privates. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2322.6s)]
*  I know, we're living the life. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2325.3999999999996s)]

*  Look at my shoes, look at my shoes. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2328.8399999999997s)]
*  The surge in success this season is about more than the basketball. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2331.24s)]
*  The arrival walk to the locker room is now a fixture in pro sports. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2335.2799999999997s)]
*  W players absolutely own this space, social media rocket fuel that engages fans. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2339.52s)]
*  Players love it, Kaitlyn Clark included. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2346.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh my god, everything. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2348.3599999999997s)]
*  Who did this? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2350.3599999999997s)]

*  Oh my god. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2352.48s)]
*  Consistent with the life cycle of other successful pro sports leagues, the players are done taking [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2353.48s)]
*  one for the team. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2358.48s)]
*  They now want to get paid. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2359.48s)]
*  Note the upcoming collective bargaining negotiations between the league and the players. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2362.8s)]
*  A rookie salary for the 42-game season, $76,000. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2367.2400000000002s)]
*  Base salary for the MVP, $200,000. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2372.04s)]
*  Yet the median NBA player salary this season, roughly $12 million. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2376.52s)]

*  I mean, someone like me, I love multiple commas just because like we deserve it. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2386.88s)]
*  We come in here and night in, night out, we work hard, you see the viewership numbers [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2393.28s)]
*  up, you see everything up. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2396.64s)]
*  I mean, I'm all for it because I love a comma. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2397.88s)]
*  Like a comma and that's salary. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2401.0s)]
*  As a union leader, Nafisa Collier will be at the bargaining table. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2403.36s)]
*  The NBA shares revenues with its players roughly $50, $50, and she wonders, is the W willing [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2407.28s)]
*  to do the same? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2413.08s)]
*  As for commas... [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2414.88s)]
*  Of course that would be obviously amazing. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2415.88s)]
*  I don't know how realistic, like that is obviously the goal and I hope that we can get there. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2418.04s)]
*  How much should we compare NBA and WNBA? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2422.4s)]
*  We're not asking for the same salaries as the NBA. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2425.76s)]
*  What we're looking for is rev shares. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2428.44s)]
*  They're making that because of rev shares. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2429.76s)]
*  And so that's what we're wanting. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2432.2s)]
*  That's how we close that gap. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2433.3599999999997s)]
*  How we're sharing that pie. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2434.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, how we're sharing it. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2435.7999999999997s)]
*  Meantime, building on this watershed season, the women of the WNBA will keep shooting their [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2437.6s)]
*  shot. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2444.48s)]
*  There we go. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2445.48s)]
*  Bang. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2446.48s)]
*  You knew that when I left your hands. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2447.48s)]
*  I know when I'm going to miss. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2449.96s)]
*  I know when I'm going to make it. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2450.96s)]
*  The worst is when it feels good and you still miss. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2452.0s)]
*  But you know as soon as soon as it leaves your fingertips. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2453.9199999999996s)]
*  It feels good, yeah. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2456.52s)]
*  So like if I miss it and it feels good, like, that's fine. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2457.52s)]
*  You're okay with that? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2460.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good shot. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2462.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2463.12s)]
*  With that as encouragement from this season's Rookie of the Year, we finally gave in. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2464.12s)]
*  I think you have to go now. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2468.48s)]
*  Come on. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2470.12s)]
*  Let's see if you can get it there. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2471.12s)]
*  Two more. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2472.12s)]
*  You know what? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2473.12s)]
*  I have no legs. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2474.12s)]
*  So I can come in here. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2475.12s)]
*  No, I feel confident. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2476.12s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2477.12s)]
*  I'm wearing this jacket. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2478.12s)]
*  Oh. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2479.12s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2480.12s)]
*  That's not bad. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2481.12s)]
*  Get it there. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2482.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2483.12s)]
*  You got to jump. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2484.12s)]
*  Tight rims. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2485.12s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2486.12s)]
*  No. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2487.12s)]

*  countryside for mezcal, the agave spirit made by hand. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2518.64s)]
*  Artisanal mezcal resists machinery. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2523.7599999999998s)]
*  The agave is roasted in underground pits for days, and it's crushed by horse-drawn mill. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2526.8799999999997s)]
*  The mash is fermented in wooden barrels and distilled twice in copper vats. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2533.72s)]
*  No temperature dials or controls. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2539.24s)]

*  We'll be right back with the mezcaleros. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2548.24s)]
*  For years, mezcal sat in the shadow of its popular cousin tequila, known for its worm [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2555.2799999999997s)]
*  and deemed too smoky for a spot on the same shelf as premium spirits. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2560.3999999999996s)]
*  But not anymore. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2565.04s)]
*  Once banned and later sold in plastic jugs for pennies, the handcrafted spirit has found [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2566.52s)]
*  its way into cocktail bars and Michelin-starred restaurants. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2571.72s)]
*  No other liquor has seen a greater increase in production in the past decade. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2575.68s)]
*  Mezcal gets its name from the Aztec word for cuchte agave, a thorny plant sacred to Mexico [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2580.7599999999998s)]
*  for thousands of years. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2586.14s)]
*  The vast majority of mezcal is made in the southern state of Oaxaca, where family-owned [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2588.24s)]
*  distilleries dot the landscape. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2592.96s)]
*  We went to meet the mezcaleros as they labored to quench the world's thirst for mezcal. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2595.48s)]
*  Mezcaleros harvest agave year-round, but it's no low-hanging fruit. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2605.0s)]
*  Cried from the earth, the spikes are removed by machete, revealing the heart, the pina, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2610.48s)]
*  which looks like a hundred-pound pineapple. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2617.0s)]
*  Agave takes its sweet time to ripen, up to 30 years for some varieties. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2620.44s)]
*  It grows in the valleys that run between the Sierra Madre Mountains, here in Oaxaca. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2626.08s)]
*  The crossroads of indigenous and Spanish colonial cultures, the birthplace of mezcal, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2634.16s)]
*  and Santiago Matatlan is its cradle. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2640.7599999999998s)]
*  The Hernández brothers, Armando and Álvaro, are fourth-generation mezcaleros from an indigenous [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2644.8399999999997s)]

*  Today they run Mal de Amor, one of Matatlan's largest distilleries, or Palenques. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2655.24s)]
*  We make mezcal without hurry, meaning everything in its time. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2661.7599999999998s)]
*  We don't add or do anything to speed up production, but we make it nonstop, 365 days a year, the [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2670.6s)]
*  entire day. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2677.0s)]
*  Is it different from the way your father made it? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2678.24s)]
*  No, it's the same. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2681.12s)]
*  We conserve all the traditions, everything we were taught, and everything is done by [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2685.2s)]
*  hand. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2689.12s)]
*  Agave was first distilled here in the 1600s. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2690.16s)]
*  Mexicans have been drinking mezcal at baptisms, funerals, and every occasion in between ever [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2693.8399999999997s)]
*  since. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2700.08s)]
*  And let's clear this up early. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2701.08s)]
*  Tequila is a type of mezcal, made with blue agave, mostly in the state of Jalisco. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2703.16s)]
*  But most tequila has been mass-produced, made by machines since the 70s. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2709.44s)]
*  Artisanal mezcal resists machinery. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2715.24s)]
*  The agave is roasted in underground pits for days. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2718.48s)]
*  Then it's crushed by horse-drawn mill. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2721.92s)]
*  The mash is fermented in wooden barrels and distilled twice in copper vats. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2725.28s)]
*  No temperature dials or controls. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2730.84s)]
*  Bubbles indicate the alcohol content. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2734.32s)]
*  Who knows more about the process? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2738.12s)]
*  I think he may know more. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2741.92s)]
*  But I drink it more. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2744.88s)]
*  At Mal de Amor, they offer Napa-style tours of their agave fields. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2748.48s)]
*  Mezcal is now a half-billion-dollar-a-year industry. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2756.64s)]
*  But in the 1980s and 90s, Armando and Álvaro told us production of mezcal could barely [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2760.04s)]
*  support the family. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2765.64s)]
*  The price of mezcal was very low. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2768.88s)]
*  It was miserable. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2771.04s)]
*  What was it? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2772.04s)]
*  Seven pesos for a liter of mezcal. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2775.04s)]
*  And we were ten children. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2778.12s)]
*  Sunday was the only day we could afford a cup of milk and a piece of bread. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2782.88s)]
*  So we decided to go. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2787.6400000000003s)]
*  Armando left Mexico first, alone, bound for California. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2789.56s)]
*  Do you remember the day you left? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2794.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2796.56s)]
*  It was the 3rd of December, 1992. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2797.56s)]
*  I was 12 years old. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2800.98s)]
*  I have children of my own now, and I could never bring myself to let them cross the border [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2806.04s)]
*  alone. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2810.16s)]
*  It was a sad goodbye. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2811.16s)]
*  Very painful to leave the family behind. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2814.56s)]
*  How did you get there? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2816.88s)]
*  Like all migrants, with a coyote, smuggled across the border. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2820.84s)]
*  Álvaro eventually joined him in Los Angeles. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2824.88s)]
*  They spent a decade working in bars and restaurants. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2827.4s)]
*  When the plot twisted, artisanal became hip and mezcal's popularity boomed. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2830.96s)]
*  Álvaro began to dream about returning to the family business. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2836.88s)]
*  I had plans drawn up for the palenque, and I showed Armando. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2842.12s)]
*  Álvaro came in with the plan for his palenque, and he spread it on the bed and said, I'm [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2849.12s)]
*  going to do this. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2853.12s)]
*  And I told him, you're crazy. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2855.84s)]
*  How are you going to make a living? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2857.6s)]
*  Armando was skeptical until he noticed shots of mezcal going for $10 each. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2859.16s)]
*  He says he looked down at the label on a bottle one day, and it was from their hometown. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2865.48s)]
*  And you finally told your brother, I told you so. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2870.8799999999997s)]
*  So Armando and Álvaro went back home to ramp up the family palenque. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2876.2s)]
*  Enter John Rexer and Gilberto Márquez of the mezcal brand Ilegal, made from 100% espadín, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2881.24s)]
*  a variety of agave that ripens the fastest. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2889.08s)]
*  So how far out does the Ilegal mezcal go? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2892.04s)]
*  Is this all Ilegal? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2895.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2897.56s)]
*  There's about 2,500 plants per acre. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2898.56s)]
*  There's about five acres out here. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2902.08s)]
*  This is a lot of espadín, right? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2903.64s)]
*  Today, Ilegal is one of the top-selling mezcal brands. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2905.7599999999998s)]
*  And it, too, started humbly. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2909.52s)]
*  Rexer, an expat New Yorker, was in search of a steady supply of mezcal to serve at a [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2911.88s)]
*  bar he owned in Guatemala. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2917.08s)]
*  I would take a bus up from Guatemala. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2919.12s)]
*  It's a 24-hour bus ride. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2920.72s)]
*  Along the way, you can pull a string in that bus and say, I want to stop here, walk to [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2923.36s)]
*  a village, wait until lights came on somewhere and say, hey, do you know anybody who makes [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2927.64s)]
*  good mezcal around here? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2932.64s)]
*  And invariably, someone would have an uncle, a brother, a cousin. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2934.24s)]
*  Tengo un tío. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2937.88s)]
*  Tengo un tío. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2938.88s)]
*  Sí. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2939.88s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2940.88s)]
*  Everybody has an uncle. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2941.88s)]
*  The name on the bottle suggests Rexer's operation wasn't exactly legal. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2942.88s)]
*  Is it true that you once dressed like a priest to have to get this across a border? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2948.56s)]
*  Listen, I went through 12 years of Catholic school. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2952.92s)]
*  Me too. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2956.04s)]
*  I knew how to play the role. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2957.04s)]
*  It was his friend, Gilberto Márquez, who introduced him to the Hernández brothers. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2958.52s)]
*  And we rolled down here, and it was very, very, very tiny, and they were making very [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2963.52s)]
*  small amounts. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2968.32s)]
*  Me dice, tienes más de este mezcal? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2969.32s)]
*  Dijo, sí. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2971.36s)]
*  He asks me, do you have more of this mezcal? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2972.36s)]
*  And we said, yes. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2975.2000000000003s)]
*  We have 10,000 liters. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2976.84s)]
*  And it took us like two years to make. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2977.84s)]
*  And John says to us, I want it all. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2981.8s)]
*  A sidebar, and this may go without saying, but Rexer has swigged his fair share of mezcal. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2984.6800000000003s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2990.8s)]
*  Do you want a water? [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2991.8s)]
*  Yeah, no, take a break. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2992.8s)]
*  You're good. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2993.8s)]
*  He's like, do I want a water? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2994.8s)]
*  You know, there's an expression, the best mezcal is the one in front of you. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=2995.8s)]
*  It's not entirely true. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3000.92s)]
*  You don't want to cover it in smoke. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3002.26s)]
*  You want to taste the agave. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3004.42s)]
*  A lot of people say they don't like mezcal because of the smoke. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3006.3s)]
*  Obviously you're in a smoky environment, right? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3009.78s)]
*  When you dig up the pit oven, there's smoke everywhere. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3011.6200000000003s)]
*  So there's a lot of early mezcals that came into the States that are heavy smoked. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3014.28s)]
*  Has mezcal gotten a bad rap on that front? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3018.6000000000004s)]
*  I think in the early days it did, but people began to discover, no, the agaves have particular [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3021.0400000000004s)]
*  unique flavors. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3026.1200000000003s)]
*  Rexer asked brothers Armando and Alvaro to go into business, and he made a promise if [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3027.42s)]
*  they could produce the mezcal, he'd sell it around the world. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3032.86s)]
*  They'd been burned by false promises before, so they weighed his offer in their native [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3037.26s)]
*  language. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3041.66s)]
*  You spoke in Zapotec so he wouldn't understand? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3042.66s)]
*  I said to Alvaro, in Zapotec, do you believe him? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3045.14s)]
*  And he said, I don't know. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3050.1s)]
*  But we figured, let's see. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3052.26s)]
*  I said, listen, I'll pay you upfront so that we can get started. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3053.82s)]
*  Two days later, we had the deposit in our account for all 10,000 liters. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3059.6600000000003s)]
*  He said, each month I'll keep making deposits. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3064.6200000000003s)]
*  So we made more, 500 liters, 1,000, 2,000, and it grew like that. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3067.54s)]
*  Now their partnership produces 3,000 bottles of mezcal a day, almost all of them for export. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3074.2200000000003s)]
*  And every bottle is certified by the Mexican government, stamped with a hologram to mark [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3081.34s)]
*  denomination of origin, like champagne or cognac. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3086.46s)]
*  We'd heard there are rules about how to drink this artisanal mezcal. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3091.06s)]
*  The good stuff isn't for shots or diluting in cocktails. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3095.34s)]
*  It's for sipping. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3099.44s)]
*  So we asked Marquez, the former bartender who now promotes Ilegal. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3100.84s)]
*  Favorite way to drink it? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3105.54s)]
*  Spicy margarita. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3106.54s)]
*  Oh, wait a second. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3107.54s)]
*  I thought you weren't supposed to drink mezcal in a margarita. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3109.46s)]
*  You do want to enjoy mezcal neat, but there's nothing wrong with having it in a cocktail, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3112.14s)]
*  especially if we're trying to get folks to try it for the first time. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3117.02s)]
*  It's an introduction to mezcal. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3120.62s)]
*  Marquez poured us a joven, the colorless mezcal you'll find in most bottles. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3122.66s)]
*  This is 100% espadin. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3127.9s)]
*  So joven means young. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3130.5s)]
*  Joven means young, unaged. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3131.5s)]
*  Salud. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3133.62s)]
*  Salud. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3134.62s)]
*  This one tastes spicy to me. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3135.62s)]
*  So smoke is not the first thing that you taste? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3140.58s)]
*  It's definitely there, but I would not call this smoky. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3142.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3145.74s)]
*  Aging mezcal is a Mexican tradition. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3146.74s)]
*  Ilegal does it in American oak, the same way bourbon is made. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3149.74s)]
*  So this is the anejo, and this is aged 15 months. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3154.54s)]
*  Color's definitely darker. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3158.02s)]
*  Yep. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3160.06s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3161.74s)]
*  So good. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3164.18s)]
*  Absolutely neat. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3165.66s)]
*  100%. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3167.14s)]
*  Has anyone ever said to you, hey, what's a gringo like you doing? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3168.54s)]
*  In a place like this? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3172.7799999999997s)]
*  Selling Oaxaca, Oaxaca and mezcal? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3173.7799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3175.7799999999997s)]
*  I've gotten pushback over the years, you're a foreigner. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3176.7799999999997s)]
*  But I'm someone who fell in love with the rhythm and the pace of Oaxaca and fell in [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3179.2999999999997s)]
*  love with mezcal. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3184.62s)]
*  He's no longer the only foreigner in this partnership. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3186.14s)]
*  Bacardi, the largest privately held global spirits company, acquired Ilegal last year [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3188.94s)]
*  in a deal worth a reported $100 million. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3195.1400000000003s)]
*  When we started to grow the brand, one of the questions I asked myself was, how do you [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3198.98s)]
*  fall in love with something and then not destroy the thing you fell in love with by making [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3204.6200000000003s)]
*  it grow? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3208.1s)]
*  Can you do that with an international conglomerate like Bacardi? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3209.1s)]
*  I think it's a great question because it's not just the beautiful liquor, but it's certain [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3212.1400000000003s)]
*  things that we're trying to preserve and believe in. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3216.7s)]
*  This is a family business. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3218.9399999999996s)]
*  We have to respect the artisanal production. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3220.66s)]
*  You can never let this become industrial. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3222.98s)]
*  What does the deal with Bacardi mean for you? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3225.4199999999996s)]
*  What's going to change is many people's lives in this community. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3229.7799999999997s)]
*  It's a benefit for the whole community. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3234.46s)]
*  The Palenque now employs a hundred people from Matatlan and beyond, including their [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3236.8399999999997s)]

*  We asked what Senor Hernandez thought of his son's mezcal. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3251.14s)]
*  Does it live up to the family name? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3255.1s)]
*  That's why I drink it. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3260.46s)]
*  If not, I wouldn't drink it. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3261.46s)]
*  The Hernandez brothers are expanding the family Palenque. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3264.54s)]

*  Her family has been making mezcal since it was more bootleg than above board. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3451.82s)]
*  And your grandmother sold mezcal from the back of a burro? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3458.06s)]
*  So my great-grandfather produced the mezcal and my great-grandmother sold it. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3463.5s)]
*  And why did she sell it? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3467.82s)]
*  Because nobody inspected the women at the time. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3469.62s)]
*  She made a special knock at the door, opened the door, and the woman with the donkey takes [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3474.42s)]
*  out her mezcal. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3478.94s)]

*  The Careño family distills in clay pots. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3484.02s)]
*  Eleven thousand liters of mezcal a year, some eight thousand bottles. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3486.9s)]
*  Many go for upwards of a hundred dollars. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3492.22s)]
*  Making artisanal mezcal is part science, part intuition. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3495.82s)]
*  And it comes with a funk, which we saw and smelled inside Careño's fermentation room. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3500.46s)]
*  Right now it's not too fermented. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3509.02s)]

*  It's very clear. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3524.46s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3525.46s)]
*  Careño showed us how she knows when it's ready for the next step. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3526.46s)]
*  If I put my ear to it, listen. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3534.66s)]

*  I think maybe another four days. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3544.1s)]

*  Three hours south of Oaxaca City at the Perez family palenque, we met Lalo Perez, a fifth [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3553.7s)]
*  generation mezcalero. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3560.62s)]
*  That's the next generation holding his hand. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3562.66s)]
*  The whole family had just pulled an all-nighter tending the fire for their roast. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3566.66s)]
*  A community ritual. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3574.46s)]
*  Neighbors came by in the morning to help stack the piñas. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3576.4199999999996s)]
*  And Lalo's father, Tio Teo, watched over. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3580.5s)]
*  How was the roast last night? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3584.34s)]
*  Around eight in the morning, we finally started stacking the piñas. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3588.5s)]
*  We joked about being beat from the night before. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3594.86s)]
*  But Lalo says making mezcal doesn't feel like work. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3597.54s)]
*  From the moment I go out into the countryside to harvest agave, I feel like I want to taste [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3603.5s)]
*  it already. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3608.22s)]
*  You're smiling when you tell me this. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3609.4599999999996s)]
*  It's the joy that mezcal brings me. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3614.4199999999996s)]
*  If you drink five glasses, it brings you even more joy. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3617.9399999999996s)]
*  Lalo walked us through his agave varieties with names like madre cuiche and tepestate. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3623.9399999999996s)]
*  He told us each gives a unique taste, herbal, mineral, earthy. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3629.9399999999996s)]
*  Tio Teo insisted we taste for ourselves and led us to his private stash where he keeps [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3636.98s)]
*  his prized batches. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3642.2200000000003s)]
*  Muy diferente. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3644.5s)]
*  Sí, muy diferente. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3645.5s)]
*  Wow. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3646.5s)]
*  Tepestate is the winner. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3647.5s)]
*  Lalo has taken over most of the manual labor from his dad using wooden mallets to crush [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3651.78s)]
*  the roasted agave. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3656.58s)]
*  He distills batches of about 250 bottles at a time. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3658.42s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3663.02s)]
*  Mezcal produced by the Perez family can't technically be called mezcal. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3664.7s)]
*  It is made in the right region using the right methods to qualify for denomination of origin. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3669.06s)]
*  But Lalo told us he doesn't bother with the bureaucracy of getting it certified by government-approved [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3674.3399999999997s)]
*  regulators. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3680.3799999999997s)]
*  You don't put the word mezcal on your bottles to sell. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3681.8599999999997s)]
*  Does that bother you? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3685.2599999999998s)]
*  On the contrary. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3687.62s)]
*  To certify it, they practically tell you how to make your mezcal. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3688.8799999999997s)]
*  An inspector comes and tells you, don't crush with wooden mallets. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3692.18s)]
*  Water it down so that it'll pass lab tests. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3696.94s)]
*  And then I'll certify it so you can sell it. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3699.7s)]
*  We don't need a government certifier to come and tell us how to make mezcal. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3703.54s)]
*  There's no doubt in your mind that what's inside your bottles is mezcal. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3707.8999999999996s)]
*  Maybe so, but Cinco Sentidos, the brand that bottles the Perez family's product for export, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3713.3799999999997s)]
*  has to label the uncertified mezcal distilled agave. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3719.5s)]
*  In bars around the world, that's become a selling point. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3723.46s)]
*  Small batch enthusiasts clamor for obscure, limited run bottles, and mezcal by any other [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3727.3s)]
*  name still smells as sweet. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3733.1400000000003s)]
*  Graciela Carreño chose to drop denomination of origin two years ago. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3736.1800000000003s)]
*  Her main focus now is her plants. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3740.9s)]
*  Once you harvest agave, that's it. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3743.7000000000003s)]
*  This is not like grapes. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3746.42s)]
*  The crop does not grow back each year. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3747.74s)]
*  You can only benefit from it once in its lifetime, and it takes 30 years to give you its best. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3753.1s)]
*  If mezcaleros obsess over their agave, it's because they're trying to avoid repeating [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3759.7799999999997s)]
*  tequila's mistakes. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3764.8199999999997s)]
*  Overplanting of blue agave used in tequila has rendered that plant more susceptible to [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3766.8599999999997s)]
*  disease. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3772.06s)]
*  Carreño says she worries the same could happen to mezcal's workhorse variety, espadín. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3773.38s)]
*  It's like tequila, only with mezcal we plant espadín, only espadín. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3780.42s)]
*  The irony is on the world market, what people want most is not espadín. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3787.2999999999997s)]
*  It's wild agave. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3793.2599999999998s)]
*  But wild agave has its own problems. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3795.0s)]
*  As production of mezcal has increased 700 percent from 10 years ago, some species of [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3797.74s)]
*  agave are vanishing. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3803.4599999999996s)]
*  So Carreño germinates the seeds from 12 varieties in her nursery. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3805.5s)]
*  How concerned are you about the future of the agave plant in Oaxaca? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3810.5s)]
*  Where do I start? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3818.54s)]
*  On the one hand, we have economic success because this spirit that came from our community [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yThiwPDB0&t=3819.9599999999996s)]
