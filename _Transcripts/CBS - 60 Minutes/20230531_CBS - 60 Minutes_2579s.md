# Canada's Unmarked Graves; Sharswood | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [May 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw)
*  Tonight on 60 Minutes Presents, Revisiting the Past. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=0.0s)]
*  I grew up a very, very mean woman because of all what happened to me. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=8.56s)]
*  You learned that here, you think? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=17.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=19.1s)]
*  She is not the only one. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=20.1s)]
*  More than 150,000 children were sent to residential schools, which Canada's first prime minister [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=22.2s)]
*  supported to, in his words, sever children from the tribe and civilize them. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=27.88s)]
*  My name was number 65 for all those years. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=34.4s)]
*  Just a number? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=38.12s)]
*  Just a number, yeah. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=39.12s)]
*  65, pick that up, stupid, or 65, why'd you do that, idiot? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=40.12s)]
*  The Millers are a large family that enjoy getting together. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=49.04s)]
*  They purchased this historic house in southern Virginia near where they grew up to have [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=53.68s)]
*  a place for family celebrations. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=59.12s)]
*  This is an original room from the 1800s. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  But no one could have imagined how the history of the home and its grounds would change everything [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=64.64s)]
*  they thought they knew about their family's history. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=70.64s)]
*  It's like a full circle, like it was meant to happen to me, like it was meant to happen. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=74.16s)]
*  This is God. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  This is where we're supposed to be. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=81.08s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=91.0s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=92.0s)]
*  Welcome to 60 Minutes Presents. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=93.28s)]
*  Tonight, Revisiting the Past. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=95.8s)]
*  We'll look at stories from history that carry lessons for the present. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=98.72s)]
*  We begin with our story of Canada's unmarked graves. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=103.36s)]
*  In May 2021, when archaeologists detected what they believed to be 200 unmarked graves [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  at an old school in Canada, it brought new attention to one of the most shameful chapters [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=115.04s)]
*  of that nation's history. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  Starting in the 1880s and much of the 20th century, more than 150,000 children from hundreds [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=123.76s)]
*  of Indigenous communities across Canada were forcibly taken from their parents by the government [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  and sent to what were called residential schools. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=137.68s)]
*  Funded by the state and run by churches, they were designed to assimilate and Christianize [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=141.16s)]
*  Indigenous children by ripping them from their parents, their culture, and their community. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=147.48s)]
*  The children were often referred to as savages and forbidden from speaking their languages [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=154.4s)]
*  or practicing their traditions. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=160.76s)]
*  As Anderson Cooper first reported last year, many were physically and sexually abused [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=163.68s)]
*  and thousands of children never made it home. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=169.96s)]
*  The last of Canada's 139 residential schools for Indigenous children closed in 1998. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=174.8s)]
*  Most have been torn down. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  But the Muskaugan Residential School in Saskatchewan still stands. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=183.8s)]
*  Its windows boarded up, its rooms gutted. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=188.44s)]
*  A reminder to a nation that would rather forget, a three-story tombstone for generations of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=191.92s)]
*  children who died here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=197.96s)]
*  Sometimes I wish it would be gone for all what happened here. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=200.12s)]
*  You wish this had been torn down? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=203.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=205.28s)]
*  I could hear everything in here, what was done. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=206.28s)]
*  It lingers. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  Leona Wolfe, who comes from the Muskaugan Reserve, was five years old when she says she was taken [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  from her home in 1960. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=217.72s)]
*  Local officials and police would often show up unannounced in Indigenous communities and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=220.44s)]
*  round up children, some as young as three. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=225.24s)]
*  Parents could be jailed if they refused to hand their children over. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=229.2s)]
*  When kids arrived at their schools, their traditional long hair was shaved off. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  If they tried to speak their language, they were often punished. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=237.28s)]
*  They put me in a dark room like that and they'd shut the door and then they'd take off the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=241.6s)]
*  light. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=247.96s)]
*  The light to look through was this much light like I was in jail. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=248.96s)]
*  She says the abuse many kids in Muskaugan suffered from the Catholic priests and nuns [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=254.6s)]
*  wasn't just physical. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=259.92s)]
*  Father Joelle was fondling the girls here. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=262.04s)]
*  A priest, Father Joelle, was fondling girls in the church? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=266.68s)]
*  Yeah, this used to be sick bay. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=269.32s)]
*  They used to have a bed here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=270.92s)]
*  And he would take girls into the bed? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=275.56s)]
*  My cousin. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=276.56s)]
*  He took your cousin in here? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=277.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=279.16s)]
*  She was only eight. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=280.16s)]
*  I grew up a very, very mean woman because of all what happened to me. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=281.64s)]
*  You learned that here, you think? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=289.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=291.96s)]
*  She is not the only one. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=292.96s)]
*  More than 150,000 children were sent to residential schools, which Canada's first prime minister [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=295.02s)]
*  supported to, in his words, sever children from the tribe and civilize them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=300.68s)]
*  After much of the 20th century, the Canadian government supported that mission. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=307.16s)]
*  This report aired in 1955. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=311.92s)]
*  They learned not only games and traditions, such as the celebration of St. Valentine's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=313.68s)]
*  Day, but the mastery of words. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=319.16s)]
*  The idea for the schools came in part from the United States. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=321.76000000000005s)]
*  In 1879, the Carlisle Indian Industrial School opened in Pennsylvania, where this photo was [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=325.68s)]
*  taken of Native American children when they first arrived. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  This is them four months later. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=336.02s)]
*  The school's motto was, kill the Indian, save the man. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=338.26s)]
*  Consequently, ours was, kill the Indian in the child. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=342.82s)]
*  Kill the Indian in the child. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=347.02s)]
*  That was the guiding principle here in Canada. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=349.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=351.7s)]
*  Chief Wilton Littlechild, whose Cree was six years old when he was taken to this residential [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=352.7s)]
*  school in Alberta, then he says he was given a new name. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=357.53999999999996s)]
*  My name was number 65 for all those years. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=362.8s)]
*  Just a number? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=366.52000000000004s)]
*  Just a number, yeah. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  65, pick that up, stupid. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=368.52000000000004s)]
*  Or 65, why'd you do that, idiot? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  What does that feel like, at six years old, to be called a number? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=373.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think that's where the trauma begins. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=376.32s)]
*  Not just the physical abuse, psychological abuse, spiritual abuse, and worst of all, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=379.44s)]
*  sexual abuse. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=386.44s)]
*  You were sexually abused? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=387.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=388.52s)]
*  I think that's where my anger began as a young boy. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=389.52s)]
*  Chief Littlechild says he was able to take some of that anger out on the school's hockey [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=398.76s)]
*  rink. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=402.96s)]
*  He won a scholarship to university and graduated, eventually going on to a distinguished career [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=403.96s)]
*  in law. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  But his story is the exception. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=410.2s)]
*  They didn't kill my spirit, so I'm still Cree. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm still who I am. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=416.32s)]
*  I'm not 65. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=418.08s)]
*  My name is Mayikan Motil. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=419.47999999999996s)]
*  So they didn't kill my spirit. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=421.96s)]
*  In 2008, after thousands of school survivors filed lawsuits, the Canadian government formally [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=425.88s)]
*  apologized for its policies. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=431.64s)]
*  It also set up a $1.9 billion compensation fund and established a Truth and Reconciliation [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=434.68s)]
*  Commission that Chief Littlechild helped lead. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=441.12s)]
*  For six years, the commission heard testimony from survivors across the country. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=445.76000000000005s)]
*  And you put me under water, slapping me and hitting me, slapping me and hitting me and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=451.76000000000005s)]
*  punching me and punching me and holding me under water, pulling my hair. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=457.16s)]
*  And I thought, God, she's going to kill me. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=463.04s)]
*  I'm going to die first day of school. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=466.36s)]
*  We as little boys and little girls, we lost our innocence. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=469.84s)]
*  In 2015, the commission concluded what happened was cultural genocide. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=483.56s)]
*  It identified more than 3,000 children who died from disease due to overcrowding, malnutrition [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=488.52s)]
*  and poor sanitation or died after being abused or trying to run away. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=493.96s)]

*  Oh my God. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1035.38s)]
*  At least 100. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1037.38s)]
*  So no wonder Fred needed to find a big family. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1039.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1043.38s)]
*  Fred lives in California where he works as a civil engineer for the Air Force, but he [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1045.38s)]
*  visits the family in Virginia often. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1051.38s)]
*  One day, out of the blue, my sister called me and told me about a big house up the road for sale. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1054.38s)]
*  This sister right here? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1058.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1060.38s)]
*  Karen Dixon-Rexroth, Fred's baby sister, had spotted it. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1061.38s)]
*  Me and my mom was riding past the house and I saw the first sale sign. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1065.38s)]
*  I said, oh my goodness, we have to get this house. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1069.38s)]
*  I called Fred. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1072.38s)]
*  Fred, this house is for sale. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1073.38s)]
*  He's like, what house? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1075.38s)]
*  I said, you know the house, the scary house, I call it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1076.38s)]
*  The scary house was less than a mile up the road from their mom's. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1081.38s)]
*  They passed it every day as kids on their way to school. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1086.38s)]
*  What did you know about Sharpswood? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1090.38s)]
*  Absolutely nothing. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1093.38s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1095.38s)]
*  I just knew it was a big house. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1096.38s)]
*  He was debating, should we put in a bid for it? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1098.38s)]
*  I said yes, absolutely, let's do it. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1101.38s)]
*  Did she twist your arm? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1104.38s)]
*  I took all the twists she could do. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1105.38s)]
*  I didn't want to buy it. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1107.38s)]
*  But thinking his bid would be rejected anyway, he made an offer of just above the $220,000 asking price. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1109.38s)]
*  Why did you think they weren't going to accept the offer? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1118.38s)]
*  Well, I mean, initially with me I thought that because I was black that they would never, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1121.38s)]
*  surely they would never sell this house to someone who's black. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1126.38s)]
*  So for us to be able to own this thing, I thought it would never happen in a million years. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1129.38s)]
*  So guess what happened? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1134.38s)]
*  A million years. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1136.38s)]
*  A million years. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1137.38s)]
*  Yes, yes, absolutely. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1138.38s)]
*  We used to always see this house out here. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1140.38s)]
*  So in May of 2020, Fred Miller purchased the fully furnished house, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1142.38s)]
*  plus 10 and a half acres of land, from a family called the Thompsons who had owned it since 1917. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1148.38s)]
*  The first time I drove up to the place, all I could do was stop at the edge of the roof there and just look up in amazement, like wow, this is mine. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1156.38s)]
*  This is an original room from the 1800s. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1163.38s)]
*  Karen says she got obsessed with the house, spending nights and weekends online researching its secrets. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1166.38s)]
*  A hiding spot, they say was from the Civil War, so they would hide the valuables. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1174.38s)]
*  A secret hiding spot. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1180.38s)]
*  She discovered the house had been built around 1850 in the Gothic revival style by a well-known New York architect. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1183.38s)]
*  And she learned and told her family that its name had been Sharzwood. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1192.38s)]
*  Every day she was calling me with new information. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1197.38s)]
*  I'm like, my goodness, okay, relax. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1200.38s)]
*  Are you exaggerating? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1202.38s)]
*  No, I'm not exaggerating. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1204.38s)]
*  But then Karen turned up something that stunned her. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1206.38s)]
*  In the 1800s, Sharzwood had been the seat of a major 1300-acre plantation, one of the larger ones in the county. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1210.38s)]
*  What did you think of you owning a plantation? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1221.38s)]
*  I was a little bit, a little shocked by that, I would say, because I just wanted somewhere to have family gatherings. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1224.38s)]
*  When I found out that it was a plantation, and then I'm like, okay, Fred just bought a plantation, I was like, we own a plantation. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1231.38s)]
*  It was just a feeling of power. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1238.38s)]
*  It was just a powerful feeling. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1245.38s)]
*  It is. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1247.38s)]
*  Powerful, but of course plantation implies slavery. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1248.38s)]
*  And before the Civil War, Pennsylvania County held more than 14,000 enslaved people. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1252.38s)]
*  The state of Virginia just under 500,000. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1259.38s)]
*  I said, do you realize what this is? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1263.38s)]
*  They didn't have a clue. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1266.38s)]
*  Dexter Miller, one of Fred and Karen's many second cousins, knew something about Sharzwood because years ago he'd been coworkers with Bill Thompson, whose family then owned it. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1268.38s)]
*  Bill joined us for a conversation on what used to be his childhood porch. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1281.38s)]
*  You grew up in this house? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1286.38s)]
*  I did. This was my home. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1288.38s)]
*  He inherited much of the farmland and still lives up the road. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1290.38s)]
*  His sister inherited the house and sold it to Fred. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1294.38s)]
*  You know, when Fred was buying the house, he did not think that the house would be sold to a black person. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1299.38s)]
*  Why would you think that for you? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1306.38s)]
*  Because, you know, we are in rural Virginia, right? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1308.38s)]
*  Well, this is true. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1312.38s)]
*  For years, Dexter and another second cousin, Sonia Womack Miranda, had been trying to piece together the Miller family's origins. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1315.38s)]
*  A notoriously difficult task for African Americans because records are hard to come by, especially before 1865. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1325.38s)]
*  It really was a hobby. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1334.38s)]
*  It was addictive. It was addictive. It really was. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1336.38s)]
*  You were like private eyes. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1339.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1340.38s)]
*  They'd been able to trace the whole Miller clan back to one woman. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1341.38s)]
*  It's Dexter's great-grandmother. It's my great-great-grandmother, Sarah. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1346.38s)]
*  Sarah Miller. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1352.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1353.38s)]
*  They had found a picture of Sarah Miller. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1354.38s)]
*  This is Sarah right here. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1356.38s)]
*  And they got in hold of her death certificate, which showed that she'd been born in Pennsylvania County in 1868, just three years after the end of the Civil War. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1358.38s)]
*  And they found an even better resource, one of their oldest living relatives, a beloved former schoolteacher named Marion Keyes. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1369.38s)]
*  Miss Keyes, as everyone here calls her, recently turned 90. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1378.38s)]
*  Sarah Miller is the matriarch of the family. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1384.38s)]
*  Yes, she was. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1387.38s)]
*  Did you know her? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1389.38s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1390.38s)]
*  Well, tell us about her. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1391.38s)]
*  She would always be out there with a broom in her hand, and she would be waiting for us. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1393.38s)]
*  Marion Keyes remembers her great-grandmother, Sarah, as a force to be reckoned with. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1397.38s)]
*  What she wanted you to know, you were going to know it. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1403.38s)]
*  Was she persnickety, as they say? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1407.38s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1409.38s)]
*  Was she difficult? Stern? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1410.38s)]
*  Very, very. She didn't play. She didn't play. But we loved her. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1412.38s)]
*  But that's where Miss Keyes' knowledge of Miller family history ended. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1417.38s)]
*  She didn't know anything about the generations before emancipation. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1422.38s)]
*  When you were growing up, what did you learn or hear from your parents about slavery? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1427.38s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1433.38s)]
*  Nothing? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1434.38s)]
*  Nothing. They did not talk about it. I don't know whether they were afraid, whether it was too miserable or painful, or they wanted to forget it. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1435.38s)]
*  I don't know. But they did not talk to us about it at all. And we didn't ask them questions about it. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1444.38s)]
*  Why not? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1450.38s)]
*  We were afraid to. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1451.38s)]
*  We heard that again and again from members of the Miller family. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1453.38s)]
*  Slavery wasn't mentioned at all. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1458.38s)]
*  Was there almost a code? We don't talk about slavery, so nobody did? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1461.38s)]
*  It was something that every black person knew you didn't talk about. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1466.38s)]
*  Your parents would tell you not to discuss grown people business. That's what they'll tell you. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1474.38s)]
*  The first time slavery was discussed was, I guess, in the 70s when Roots came, the movie Roots came about. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1480.38s)]
*  That's the first time? When Roots was on television? Did you read about it in school? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1486.38s)]
*  Not much. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1491.38s)]
*  His family also remembers Roots as pivotal. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1493.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1497.38s)]
*  I think that's what we all remember. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1498.38s)]
*  But even after Roots, you didn't go and say, what about our family? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1502.38s)]
*  No. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1506.38s)]
*  Even then, what held you back? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1507.38s)]
*  I just didn't think they wanted to talk about it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1509.38s)]
*  But didn't you want to know? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1511.38s)]
*  I would love to have known. I would love to have known. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1513.38s)]
*  Fred's purchase of Sharzwood was about to give him a crash course in his hometown slavery roots. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1516.38s)]
*  It started with a call from two archaeologists who wanted to come do research. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1523.38s)]
*  We're historic preservationists, and so we start from the idea that these places matter. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1528.38s)]
*  Dennis Pogue once worked at Mount Vernon. Doug Sanford at Monticello. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1535.38s)]
*  They asked if they could come explore Sharzwood, but they weren't interested in the ornate house designed by that famous architect. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1541.38s)]
*  What they cared about was the dilapidated building with the tin roof past the big oak tree behind it. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1550.38s)]
*  They suspected it had once been slave quarters. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1558.38s)]
*  There were once hundreds of thousands of these buildings. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1562.38s)]
*  These were one of the most common types of architecture in Virginia. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1566.38s)]
*  Let me give you the running dimensions. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1569.38s)]
*  But now these buildings are rare, with fewer than 1,500 believed to be still standing. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1572.38s)]
*  And Pogue and Sanford started a project to search for them. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1578.38s)]
*  So one, two, three, four. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1582.38s)]
*  Fred and Karen invited them to come investigate. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1584.38s)]
*  They examined, measured, and searched for clues. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1587.38s)]
*  You can see the siding is... [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1591.38s)]
*  They showed us some of what they found. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1593.38s)]
*  These are the kind of nails that we expect to see on buildings before 1800. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1595.38s)]
*  Handmade, wrought nails. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1600.38s)]
*  Handmade? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1602.38s)]
*  You can actually see the hammer strokes on the head. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1603.38s)]
*  Is this the original siding? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1606.38s)]
*  These are remnants of the original siding, absolutely. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1608.38s)]
*  They worked from noon to dusk and finally gave Karen and Fred their conclusion. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1611.38s)]
*  It's got a complex history, but we think part of that history, a big part of that history, was a quarter for enslaved folks. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1619.38s)]
*  They say it's one of the best preserved they've seen. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1626.38s)]
*  I believe it was originally built in the late 1700s as a house for a white family. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1630.38s)]
*  That's where the original door was. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1636.38s)]
*  And was later divided into two separate, single-room slave dwellings. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1639.38s)]
*  Two families. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1644.38s)]
*  Yeah, one household here, another enslaved household over there. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1645.38s)]
*  It just showed there was two different worlds. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1649.38s)]
*  This front big, beautiful world here in the lavish, and you go right behind the house and it was a whole different story. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1652.38s)]
*  It's kind of crazy for me, just to even walk around out there. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1658.38s)]
*  Do you own that? Do you own the slave house too? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1661.38s)]
*  I own the slave house, I do. It's mine. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1664.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1667.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1668.38s)]
*  Fred Miller's purchase continues to surprise his family and intrigue historians when we come back. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1671.38s)]
*  When Fred Miller unwittingly purchased what he now knows to be the Shar's Wood Plantation House with slave quarters just behind it, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1689.38s)]
*  he knew virtually nothing about his own family history. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1698.38s)]
*  He'd always assumed his ancestors had been enslaved, but it felt to him like an unknowable part of a distant past. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1702.38s)]
*  Learning about his great-grandmother, Sarah Miller, whom his mother had known as a child, piqued his interest. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1711.38s)]
*  So when he found out her house was still standing just a few miles away from Shar's Wood, he asked his mother, Betty Dixon, to go there with him. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1718.38s)]
*  All right, we're going to walk down through here. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1728.38s)]
*  Betty's grandmother, Sarah, had been the first of their ancestors to be born into freedom shortly after the Civil War. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1730.38s)]
*  That's the time I saw this cabin didn't have no light, no electricity. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1738.38s)]
*  Betty remembers visiting and spending the night here with her grandmother and cousins. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1742.38s)]
*  Whoa. What is this, a one room? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1748.38s)]
*  Sarah's house didn't look much bigger than the slave dwelling. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1754.38s)]
*  Just a single room with a smaller one above it and no indoor plumbing. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1758.38s)]
*  Come a long ways, huh? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1763.38s)]
*  Sure did. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1765.38s)]
*  Glad I didn't have to live in here. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1766.38s)]
*  Well, you had to make it work. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1768.38s)]
*  You want a piece of this wallpaper to take with you? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1770.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1773.38s)]
*  Well, I hope the landlord don't say nothing. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1774.38s)]
*  Oh, Lord, there you go. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1777.38s)]
*  Sarah Miller is buried in the cemetery of the church the Miller family still attends. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1779.38s)]
*  I'm glad I can actually come in and see this. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1786.38s)]
*  But unbeknownst to this Miller family, just five miles up the road in a different church cemetery was a tombstone that also read Miller, a far older one with names Fred and his family had never heard of, but were about to. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1788.38s)]
*  In Karen's search for information about Sharzwood, she found a document that mentioned them. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1805.38s)]
*  It gave the names of the original owners, who was Nathaniel Crenshaw, Miller and also Charles Edward Miller. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1812.38s)]
*  Miller? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1820.38s)]
*  Yes, Miller. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1821.38s)]
*  Any light bulbs? Any wires connect? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1823.38s)]
*  No, not at that point. Not at that point. It did not. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1826.38s)]
*  Others had suspected a connection between the two sets of Millers. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1831.38s)]
*  Because I was telling Dexter back in 88. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1836.38s)]
*  Bill Thompson says he had mentioned the thought to Dexter 30 years ago. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1839.38s)]
*  What we had been taught in high school was that when they freed the slaves, they just took the last name of the person that was there, which was Miller. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1844.38s)]
*  I just had told Dexter, Dexter, it's a good chance that your ancestors came off of this farm. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1852.38s)]
*  He did. He said that. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1857.38s)]
*  So you knew that this was a plantation? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1859.38s)]
*  I did. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1861.38s)]
*  Well, Fred, you said you didn't know. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1862.38s)]
*  I had no idea. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1864.38s)]
*  Dexter, you didn't tell Fred. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1865.38s)]
*  I did not tell Fred. I did not tell anyone. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1867.38s)]
*  Dexter says he'd kept it to himself because he hadn't found any way to prove it. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1869.38s)]
*  And that's where this becomes a detective story, with the Miller cousins now on a mission to figure out whether it could be possible that their own ancestors might have been enslaved on the very property Fred now owned. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1875.38s)]
*  The first step was figuring out who their last enslaved ancestors were. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1892.38s)]
*  And Sarah Miller's death certificate held the answer. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1898.38s)]
*  The names of her parents, David and Violet Miller, who would have been adults at the time of emancipation. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1902.38s)]
*  Did you know anything about them? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1911.38s)]
*  Not at all. Not at all. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1913.38s)]
*  I didn't know anything about them. We didn't. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1916.38s)]
*  Even Marion Keys, who knew Sarah Miller, had never heard their names. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1918.38s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1923.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1924.38s)]
*  Sure didn't. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1925.38s)]
*  I just, I want everybody to know. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1926.38s)]
*  Enter Carice Luck Brimmer, a local historian and genealogist. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1929.38s)]
*  Karen reached out to her to see if she could help. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1934.38s)]
*  What are the special challenges looking for the ancestors of African Americans? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1938.38s)]
*  African Americans were not listed by name until the 1870 census. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1944.38s)]
*  So before that they were just a number. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1949.38s)]
*  I mean if they were enslaved they weren't listed. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1952.38s)]
*  At all. So really you're just looking for any type of tips and clues that you can. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1956.38s)]
*  She started by looking at 1860 records for Sharzwood's then owner, N.C. for Nathaniel Crenshaw Miller. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1963.38s)]
*  There he is. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1972.38s)]
*  N.C. Miller right there. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1973.38s)]
*  Yeah. He had 58 slaves here. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1975.38s)]
*  But with only age and gender listed, you have enslaved people 69, 44, 34, and not a single name. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1979.38s)]
*  There was no way of knowing whether Violet and David were among them. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1990.38s)]
*  So Carice looked up David and Violet Miller in the 1870 census, the first one after the Civil War, where they finally appeared by name. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=1995.38s)]
*  It showed they were farm hands that they couldn't read or write. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2006.38s)]
*  And it listed their children, including as Carice showed us, a very young Sarah Miller. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2011.38s)]
*  There's Sarah. She's one year old. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2019.38s)]
*  One years old. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2022.38s)]
*  And this looks like Emily. Yes. She's three. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2023.38s)]
*  And here's Samuel. Yeah. He's five. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2026.38s)]
*  To Carice, that meant Samuel, Sarah's older brother, was born before emancipation. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2030.38s)]
*  So Carice searched for him in another historical record called the Virginia Slave Birth Index, where slave owners had to list births on their property. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2037.38s)]
*  And there, under N.C. Miller's name, N.C. and there's Samuel, was Samuel. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2049.38s)]
*  And look at that. Oh my God. List Violet as his mother. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2057.38s)]
*  It was the genealogy equivalent of a smoking gun. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2062.38s)]
*  So this is proof that Violet, Sarah's mother, was enslaved by N.C. Miller. Yes. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2066.38s)]
*  And this is absolute proof. This is absolute, definite proof. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2074.38s)]
*  And you were able to tell Karen. That her ancestors, David and Violet, were enslaved at Shar's Wood. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2079.38s)]
*  That was tough. So did you call Fred? I did. I don't think he believed me. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2089.38s)]
*  I didn't believe you in the beginning. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2096.38s)]
*  So the connection suddenly is made with your family's slavery in this house. In this house. And you own it. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2099.38s)]
*  Once I realized that it was actually my blood that was here took on a whole new meaning for me. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2108.38s)]
*  It really saddens me sometimes. And I'm up, a lot of times I'm up, we hours of the night now just thinking about what happened here. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2114.38s)]
*  As news spread through the family, there was sadness. But that's not all there was. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2122.38s)]
*  I almost felt like I was losing my breath for a moment. It was almost like a feeling of being found. Yes. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2128.38s)]
*  This is where I started. And as black people, we don't always know where we started. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2134.38s)]
*  So here we are sitting in this house. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2141.38s)]
*  I feel like I'm in the plantation house. Of the plantation that my family was enslaved. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2147.38s)]
*  You're laughing as if this cannot be true. That's right. But it is. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2156.38s)]
*  I felt complete. I'm not half of a human being anymore. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2162.38s)]
*  They make me whole. Even if I don't know them, I felt a connection to them at Shar's Wood. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2171.38s)]
*  I touched a tree. I hugged a tree. And I said, oh my God, you was here when my ancestor was here. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2179.38s)]
*  I wonder which ancestor of mine touched a tree. I didn't know what to say or do. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2189.38s)]
*  I just hugged a tree and felt like I'm home. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2197.38s)]
*  He shared the news with Bill Thompson, who had had that hunch all those years ago. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2203.38s)]
*  I look at it that I've been a servant to this farm and this house my whole life. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2208.38s)]
*  And for the Miller family to come back home to my home, our home. Our home, absolutely. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2214.38s)]
*  It's great. It's a celebration of coming home. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2223.38s)]
*  This is God. This is where we're supposed to be. It's like a full circle. Like it was meant to happen to me. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2227.38s)]
*  Like it was meant to happen. The Millers also see the hand of their ancestors in all of this. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2235.38s)]
*  I think there had to be because I did everything in my power to make this fail. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2242.38s)]
*  Did not make it happen. Yeah. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2248.38s)]
*  I tried to mess it up at every angle. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2250.38s)]
*  But those ancestors had one more surprise in store. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2253.38s)]
*  With all the revelations, there was one question that continued to gnaw at Dexter. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2259.38s)]
*  Where were his enslaved ancestors buried? So last winter, he asked Bill. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2265.38s)]
*  I said, Bill, there's one question that's been bothering me. Where is the slave cemetery? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2272.38s)]
*  He said, Dexter, it's right over there. I said, right over where? He said, you see those trees over there? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2278.38s)]
*  So did you just go right up there then? We went right up there. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2285.38s)]
*  The trees Bill Thompson pointed to, just beyond Fred's property, sure didn't look like a cemetery. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2289.38s)]
*  That is, until you start to look closely. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2297.38s)]
*  Is that one of the? That's one of them right there. Oh my God. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2301.38s)]
*  As you can see, this is the indention right there. The headstone there, maybe this is the footstone on the other end. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2305.38s)]
*  Yeah. There's always seemed like to be there's one. Oh yeah. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2311.38s)]
*  Poking up through the leaves all around us were pointed rocks. Some small, some medium sized. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2314.38s)]
*  No names, no engraving, just plain anonymous markers of many, many lives. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2322.38s)]
*  Wow. This is astonishing. It is. It's kind of overwhelming, isn't it? It is. It really is. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2331.38s)]
*  I mean, we all live in the same area. We come past this place and we would not know that our ancestors were right there beside us the entire time. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2339.38s)]
*  Fred, if you hadn't bought that house. Right. You're right. If I hadn't bought that house, we'd never know. Never. Never. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2348.38s)]
*  So how has all of this affected you? It's changed me. It's definitely changed me. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2355.38s)]
*  You ever angry? I get a little bit upset sometimes when I find out things that I should have known already. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2362.38s)]
*  Angry at yourself? At myself and at the system, because I think that we should have known more. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2369.38s)]
*  What about the school system? Should have known more. Family? Should have known more. Absolutely. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2374.38s)]
*  You want the story of slavery told. I want the story of slavery told. It's important. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2380.38s)]
*  So this is converted from a door to a window? Yeah. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2387.38s)]
*  Fred wants to do whatever's necessary to preserve the slave house. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2391.38s)]
*  You know, this has been exposed for 200 years. He's in the process of setting up a nonprofit to make that possible. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2396.38s)]
*  That's important to me too, because I know a whole lot of emphasis on that big White House there. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2403.38s)]
*  But this right here is really near and dear to me. This is the story of family slavery. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2407.38s)]
*  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. There's eight right here. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2412.38s)]
*  And he's been thinking about the cemetery too. I can imagine this being someone young. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2416.38s)]
*  We have to do something about this. Yeah, I have to. And I will. I'm going to fix it. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2422.38s)]
*  Do you think you might allow historians to come? Absolutely. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2432.38s)]
*  This place will be open to anyone who wants to learn. Anyone. Anyone who can come here. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2439.38s)]
*  But for now, Sharzwood is serving the purpose Fred bought it for in the first place, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2445.38s)]
*  gathering the Miller family together in celebration. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2452.38s)]
*  Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday. Happy birthday to you. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2457.38s)]
*  What do you think Violet and David would think? They could see that you own this place. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2471.38s)]
*  Yeah, I'm hoping they would be proud of us. And I think they would be. They endured a lot. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2478.38s)]
*  I mean, I can't even imagine what they went through. Looking down on us now. They must be smiling at us. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2483.38s)]
*  Since our story first aired, Fred Miller took a new job in Virginia to be closer to his family. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2496.38s)]
*  He has set up a nonprofit Sharzwood Foundation to maintain the slave quarters and cemetery [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2503.38s)]
*  and has begun offering tours of the house. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2510.38s)]
*  Watch the Millers visit the Sharzwood Slave Cemetery for the first time. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2517.38s)]
*  There's several of them right here now. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2522.38s)]
*  At 60MinutesOvertime.com [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2524.38s)]
*  Now, the last minute of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2531.38s)]
*  Tonight's stories invited us on a journey to revisit the past. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2535.38s)]
*  As is true of so many history lessons, our looks at both Sharzwood and Canada's residential schools [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2540.38s)]
*  resurrected painful and shameful eras. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2547.38s)]
*  But other parts of those stories pointed ways to progress and healing. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2550.38s)]
*  The late David McCullough, who chronicled so much of our history, wrote, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2555.38s)]
*  History is who we are and why we are the way we are. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2560.38s)]
*  We hope tonight's broadcast has helped illuminate some of each. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2565.38s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2570.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XE6-I1onw&t=2577.38s)]
