*  Tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, on this Easter Sunday, we're going to take you to a place outside our world. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  It's not Mars or Venus, but it might as well be. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=19.26s)]
*  It's a remote peninsula in northern Greece that millions believe to be the most sacred [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=22.44s)]
*  spot on Earth. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=27.16s)]
*  It's called Mount Athos, and prayers have been offered here [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=28.92s)]
*  every day with no interruption for more than a thousand years. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  It was set aside by ancient emperors to be the spiritual [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=36.56s)]
*  capital of Orthodox Christianity, and has probably [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  changed less over the centuries than any other inhabited place [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  on the planet. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=48.08s)]
*  The monks come here from all over and do everything [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=49.36s)]
*  they can to keep what they call the world far away. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=51.8s)]
*  Not surprisingly, journalists are not exactly welcome. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=56.32s)]
*  For more than two years now, we've been corresponding, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=60.04s)]
*  negotiating, and frankly pleading for an invitation, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=63.08s)]
*  but ran into one monastic wall after another. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=66.84s)]
*  Then, much to our surprise and delight, a few months ago, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=70.32s)]
*  the monks said, OK, come see who we are. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=74.12s)]
*  This Byzantine cross marks the border between Mount Athos [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=82.2s)]
*  and the 21st century. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=86.28s)]
*  The monks come here, as they always have, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=89.08s)]
*  for the beauty, the tranquility, and the isolation. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=91.88s)]
*  But most of all, for this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=96.36s)]
*  I hope that my soul will be upon the Lord, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=98.36s)]
*  the saint of the ungodly, and the servant of Macedonia, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  and will be your servant. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=109.04s)]
*  Father Iacobos is one of the few Americans on the mountain. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=111.92s)]
*  He's been here more than half his life. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=115.48s)]
*  You have to understand the words that we're saying [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=118.56s)]
*  in today's liturgy are the same words that Christ was saying, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=122.16s)]
*  the same words that saints from the first century, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=127.4s)]
*  the second century, the third century, the fourth century. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=131.6s)]
*  And nothing has changed in Orthodoxy since then. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=136.68s)]
*  It's the only branch of Christianity [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=140.24s)]
*  that can make that claim. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=142.76s)]
*  Father Elisseios is the abbot, the top man, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=144.92s)]
*  at Simonos Petros, one of the 20 monasteries. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=148.16s)]
*  It was Abbot Elisseios who invited us here. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=151.6s)]
*  And never let us forget what a rare privilege it was. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=154.32s)]
*  It happened once in 1981. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=158.56s)]
*  The last time you invited a television crew here was 1981. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=163.44s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=169.48s)]
*  We weren't going to invite you, but your persistence [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=170.44s)]
*  convinced us to open the door. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=173.24s)]
*  The door he opened revealed the wonder that is Simonos Petros, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=174.72s)]
*  which fits like a crown on top of a rock [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  800 feet above the Aegean. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  It was built in the 14th century, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=190.88s)]
*  and the monks will tell you it must be considered a miracle [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=193.12s)]
*  that it hasn't fallen into the sea. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  There are 20 monasteries on Mount Athos. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=204.24s)]
*  Some look like medieval fortresses. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  Others are so large they resemble small cities. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  They rise from virgin forests and line the coast shrouded in mist. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=214.68s)]
*  There's nothing on this 130-square-mile peninsula [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=221.32000000000002s)]
*  other than monasteries and monks. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  We expected Mount Athos to be a quiet place, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=230.92s)]
*  but we couldn't have imagined how quiet [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=234.28s)]
*  until we were dropped off here. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=236.6s)]
*  The silence is only broken by the occasional tapping [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=238.76s)]
*  on a chiseled piece of chestnut. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=242.72s)]
*  It's a call to prayer, and it started being used here [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=244.88s)]
*  before there were bells. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=248.24s)]
*  The monks here have one goal, and that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  is how to get closer to God. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=256.6s)]
*  Father Serapion wanted us to understand [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=259.08000000000004s)]
*  that there is no place on Earth closer to heaven [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=261.92s)]
*  than Mount Athos. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=265.04s)]
*  Every day, 1,000 divine liturgies [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=266.16s)]
*  are celebrated on the peninsula. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=272.8s)]
*  It's unique in the world and in the Orthodox Church. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=275.88s)]
*  Exactly what makes it unique? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=279.16s)]
*  It's the absolute way of life of the monks. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=283.68s)]
*  It's a Spartan way of life, but all the monks we talked to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  said they never want to leave, not even for a day. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=291.92s)]
*  So they try to be self-sufficient. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=295.76s)]
*  They grow their own fruits and vegetables, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=298.20000000000005s)]
*  do their own tailoring, and when they get sick, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=300.36s)]
*  there's an in-monastery doctor, Father Emileios, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=303.48s)]
*  who's not very busy because the monks are in excellent shape. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=306.8s)]
*  There's remarkably little cancer, virtually no heart [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=310.8s)]
*  disease or Alzheimer's. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=313.88s)]
*  They must be doing something right in addition [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=315.8s)]
*  to drinking wine at 9 in the morning. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=318.24s)]
*  They eat two meals a day. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=322.92s)]
*  There is what they call the first meal, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=324.76s)]
*  which lasts 10 minutes, and the second meal, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  which lasts 10 minutes. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=329.76s)]
*  There's no meat and no dinner table conversation. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  The only sound, a monk reading from sacred texts. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=336.48s)]
*  We were surprised by how busy the monks are when they're not [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=341.92s)]
*  praying, they're working. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  Father Theodosius, born a Lutheran in Germany, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=347.44s)]
*  is a mechanical wizard who has given the monastery [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=350.56s)]
*  continuous electricity and occasional hot water. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=353.48s)]
*  Many Christians in the world, they [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=357.48s)]
*  are looking for the original church, for the ancient church. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=359.44s)]
*  You think this is the closest to the original church? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=364.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=366.48s)]
*  When you come to Orthodoxy, you will see everything [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=367.24s)]
*  you ever sought for. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=369.76s)]
*  Father Everkios takes care of the ancient footpaths here. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=372.12s)]
*  He clears the trails. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  We went with him on what was, for us, an exhausting hike [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=377.72s)]
*  on the hills above the monastery. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=381.76s)]
*  It wasn't tough for him, though. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  He says that after decades of roaming the world, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=386.0s)]
*  this is his path. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=389.20000000000005s)]
*  I've been to many places. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  Tell me where. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=392.76s)]
*  From Switzerland, of course. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  From Sweden, Finland, Spain, Portugal, Singapore, Australia, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=396.92s)]
*  and Texas. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  Texas. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=404.92s)]
*  How did you like Texas? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=405.56s)]
*  I liked very much. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=406.92s)]
*  I liked mostly the people. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=408.08s)]
*  Now, with all the traveling you've done, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=410.0s)]
*  how did you end up here? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=412.52s)]
*  I was searching for a way of life. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=414.2s)]
*  I can give all of myself to that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=416.72s)]
*  And I think the God of Jesus is above all the others, money, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=419.52s)]
*  lifestyle, even family. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=424.08s)]
*  The family at Simonis Petras consists of 54 monks [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=426.56s)]
*  from eight countries. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=430.24s)]
*  Father Yakovos came here 25 years ago [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=431.88s)]
*  from Winthrop, Massachusetts. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=434.79999999999995s)]
*  This is about as beautiful as it gets. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=436.84s)]
*  I think so. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=439.11999999999995s)]
*  He took us on a tour of the monastery. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=440.52s)]
*  It'd be tough enough to build a monastery on top of a rock [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=443.32s)]
*  today, but how did they do it in the 13th century? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=446.96s)]
*  You know, that's something which even modern day architects [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=451.67999999999995s)]
*  are amazed at. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=455.47999999999996s)]
*  When the workers came and saw the site [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=456.88s)]
*  where St. Simon, the founder of our monastery, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=460.32s)]
*  wanted to build, they looked at him and they said, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  You're crazy. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=465.28s)]
*  Are you crazy? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=465.71999999999997s)]
*  Of course. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=466.52s)]
*  So being crazy was not a bad thing? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=468.4s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=470.32s)]
*  Now, back then, how did you get stuff up here? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=471.96s)]
*  We have mules. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  It takes 15 minutes to walk through the monastery [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=476.64s)]
*  into the sunlight, enough time to find out [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=480.03999999999996s)]
*  that Father Yakovos' journey to Mount Athos [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  started at the age of six when his father showed him [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=485.96s)]
*  a picture. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=489.44s)]
*  It was just so impressive. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=491.88s)]
*  And I turned around and I said to him, Dad, you know, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=493.08s)]
*  I don't think that I'm going to be able to believe that somebody [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=495.12s)]
*  lives in that building until I step on those balconies myself. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=497.36s)]
*  Destiny. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=501.0s)]
*  It is a little bit. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=502.36s)]
*  From the age of six? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=503.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=504.8s)]
*  Father Yakovos doesn't follow what's going on in Winthrop [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=505.84s)]
*  or anywhere else today. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=509.12s)]
*  There are no newspapers, no radio, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=511.32s)]
*  no television on Mount Athos. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=513.76s)]
*  There are a few telephones. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=515.8s)]
*  And Father Yakovos got a call last year. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=517.88s)]
*  His father was dying. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=520.84s)]
*  Prior to his death, he was asking [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=522.68s)]
*  if I would go so I could see him one last time. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=525.16s)]
*  Reasonable request? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=528.72s)]
*  From a father, I think so. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=531.6s)]
*  My response was negative, though. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=534.6s)]
*  You didn't go? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=536.36s)]
*  I didn't go. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=537.24s)]
*  I didn't go because of the fact that monastics do not [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=539.12s)]
*  go to funerals of their relatives or their friends. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=542.28s)]
*  They remain here at the monastery. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=546.4s)]
*  When your father asked you to come see him one last time [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=548.3199999999999s)]
*  and you said no, was there any feeling [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=552.76s)]
*  of I'm letting my father down? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=555.12s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=556.72s)]
*  I know that we're going to see each other in paradise one day. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=557.64s)]
*  The whole idea at Mount Athos is not only [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=560.84s)]
*  to isolate oneself from the outside world, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=563.88s)]
*  but to let go of all memories of one's past life. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  The purpose of your being here, as I understand it, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=570.96s)]
*  is prayer without distraction. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=573.68s)]
*  I'm not being distracted now. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=579.12s)]
*  Why are you laughing? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=583.4s)]
*  First, tell me why you're laughing. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=584.4799999999999s)]
*  Why am I laughing? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=587.2399999999999s)]
*  Because St. Paul says we're to pray unceasingly. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=588.0799999999999s)]
*  What's funny about that? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=595.6999999999999s)]
*  That's not what's funny about it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=597.4s)]
*  What's funny is how you think I can stop praying. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=599.44s)]
*  You're praying every minute of the day. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=603.7600000000001s)]
*  Even right now when we're talking. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=606.12s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=607.5600000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=608.2800000000001s)]
*  You don't see Father Jacobo's praying while he's talking, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=609.48s)]
*  but look at these other monks. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  Their lips never stop moving, not for a second. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=615.4000000000001s)]
*  They just keep reciting the Jesus prayer day and night. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  Lord Jesus, have mercy on me. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=625.44s)]
*  It becomes like breathing. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=628.72s)]
*  Some monks say they can pray when they sleep, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=630.4s)]
*  and they get no more than three hours sleep a night. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=633.28s)]
*  But Mount Athos gets more applicants than it can handle. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=636.72s)]
*  It's harder to get into than Harvard. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=640.64s)]
*  A man comes as a novice. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=643.2s)]
*  He's free to leave if he doesn't like it, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=644.9200000000001s)]
*  and the monks can tell him to leave if they don't like him. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=647.1800000000001s)]
*  When a novice arrives here, can you [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=650.72s)]
*  tell whether he's going to make it or not? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=653.6s)]
*  Can you tell whether he's going to qualify [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=655.96s)]
*  to be a monk? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=658.3s)]
*  After a while, it becomes pretty obvious whether or not [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=663.8599999999999s)]
*  someone has cut out for it, which [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=666.5s)]
*  is why we have a trial period, which [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=668.62s)]
*  can last up to three years. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=670.4399999999999s)]
*  I bet you know a lot sooner than three years. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=672.18s)]
*  They're there. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=675.4599999999999s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=676.2199999999999s)]
*  Once he's accepted into the community, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=677.66s)]
*  it's a lifetime commitment. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=679.9799999999999s)]
*  And life never changes here. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=682.02s)]
*  Never. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=684.18s)]
*  Every day at 3 in the morning, a single bell rings, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=689.3s)]
*  informing the brothers that it's time [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=696.62s)]
*  to stop praying on their own and start praying in church. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=698.38s)]
*  On a typical day, and every day is a typical day, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=703.5799999999999s)]
*  the services last eight hours. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=707.6999999999999s)]
*  The monks say it's an eight-hour conversation with God, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=710.8199999999999s)]
*  a dress rehearsal for eternity. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=714.54s)]
*  And remember, this doesn't only happen on Sundays. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=717.34s)]
*  It happens every day, 365 days a year. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=720.14s)]
*  A monk never gets a day off. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=724.7s)]
*  This is the divine liturgy, the life of Christ, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=728.9s)]
*  celebrated by men whose only passion is to move closer [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=732.94s)]
*  to Christ every day. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=736.7800000000001s)]
*  The depth of their devotion defies description. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=740.22s)]
*  They didn't look like the same monks [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=747.38s)]
*  we had met in the gardens and the workshops. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=749.1s)]
*  They were utterly transformed, with a concentration [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=751.5s)]
*  so profound they were immune from distraction. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=754.86s)]
*  They were occasional flashes of ecstasy. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=758.7s)]
*  This old monk could have risen out of a Rembrandt. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=764.14s)]
*  There are no musical instruments in the church, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=777.34s)]
*  just chanting, chanting without end. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=780.4200000000001s)]
*  CHANTING [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=783.58s)]
*  Many of the voices, the basses in particular, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=786.5s)]
*  could have made it at the Met. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=789.74s)]
*  CHANTING [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=791.7s)]
*  The church is a place of worship, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=794.74s)]
*  a place of worship for the people of the world. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=796.9s)]
*  It's a place of worship for the people of the world. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=799.7800000000001s)]

*  CHANTING [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=805.5s)]
*  We didn't understand the words. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=816.06s)]
*  We didn't really have to. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=818.3s)]
*  This phrase we knew. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=821.8599999999999s)]
*  CHANTING [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=823.54s)]
*  Lord, have mercy. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=828.8599999999999s)]

*  CHANTING [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=841.86s)]
*  The most miraculous thing about Mount Athos, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=848.86s)]
*  when we return. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=851.78s)]
*  THE MOST MIRACULOUS THING ABOUT MOUNT ATHOS [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=860.66s)]
*  The most miraculous thing about Mount Athos [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=865.66s)]
*  may simply be the fact that it's still there. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=868.4599999999999s)]
*  Over the centuries it's been invaded by crusaders, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=871.74s)]
*  Ottomans, mercenaries, pirates and Franks. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=874.62s)]
*  The Nazis had their eyes on it too. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=877.6999999999999s)]
*  The 2,000 monks attribute their survival, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=879.9399999999999s)]
*  not surprisingly, to divine intervention. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=882.74s)]
*  But they've also been pretty crafty. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=885.86s)]
*  Some of the measures they've taken will surprise you. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=888.0600000000001s)]
*  If you'd like to come for a visit though, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=891.46s)]
*  it can be arranged, but it's not easy. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=893.14s)]
*  First you'll need a visa issued by the monks. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=896.0600000000001s)]
*  And unless you're an orthodox pilgrim, it can take a while. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=899.02s)]
*  Next you'll fly to Athens and make your way [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=902.66s)]
*  to a scruffy little town in northern Greece, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=905.78s)]
*  where there's no airport and where the roads are dicey. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=908.78s)]
*  Then you'll hop on a ferry, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=912.46s)]
*  unless the trip has been canceled because of rough seas. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=913.9s)]
*  That happens all the time. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=917.02s)]
*  But on a calm day, it can be a very pleasant ride. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=918.78s)]
*  The monks will tell you it takes years of prayer [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=925.62s)]
*  and soul searching before they're ready [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=928.06s)]
*  to leave the world for Mount Athos. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=930.3s)]
*  For the likes of us though, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=932.86s)]
*  it takes little more than an hour. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=934.34s)]
*  It was the beginning of Lent when we took these pictures [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=936.62s)]
*  and the ferry was packed with pilgrims [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=939.8199999999999s)]
*  from all over the orthodox Christian world. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=941.8199999999999s)]
*  Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, Romanians, Russians. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=945.02s)]
*  It wasn't long before the first monasteries came into view [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=949.74s)]
*  and we thought we were sailing to Byzantium, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=953.9s)]
*  to a fantasy land of castles and palaces. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=956.4200000000001s)]
*  ["Pomp and Circumstance"] [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=959.86s)]
*  ["Pomp and Circumstance"] [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=962.86s)]
*  We were headed for Vatopevi, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=972.9s)]
*  one of the oldest and largest monasteries on Mount Athos. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=974.94s)]
*  It had the feel of a medieval city. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=982.26s)]
*  Holiness seemed to seep from the very stones, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=985.46s)]
*  from the frescoes on the 10th century church, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=988.86s)]
*  from the marble font for holy water. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=991.9399999999999s)]
*  But then there was the monastery's [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=994.26s)]
*  secular looking centerpiece. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=996.38s)]
*  There's nothing remarkable about the clock tower [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=999.1s)]
*  at the Vatopedi monastery, except for one thing. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1001.34s)]
*  Check out the time. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1004.66s)]
*  It's just about 8.30. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1006.26s)]
*  Now my watch reads 2.30. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1008.5799999999999s)]
*  That's a six hour difference. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1012.1s)]
*  And there's nothing wrong with their clock or with my watch. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1013.86s)]
*  It's because the monks on Mount Athos keep Byzantine time. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1017.5s)]
*  The day starts at sunset, not at midnight. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1022.02s)]
*  The monks measure time this way [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1026.06s)]
*  during the days of the Byzantine Empire. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1027.66s)]
*  That's the Christian Empire that followed the fall of Rome. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1030.3s)]
*  And that's the flag they still fly here. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1033.74s)]
*  How long ago did the Byzantine Empire fall? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1037.1s)]
*  1453. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1040.18s)]
*  1453, that's a well-known fact. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1042.26s)]
*  Well, it wasn't to us, but to Father Serapion, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1045.1s)]
*  1453 is the day before yesterday. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1048.5s)]
*  This peninsula is the only place in the world [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1052.18s)]
*  that still keeps Byzantine time. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1055.82s)]
*  It has maintained this time for some 550 years. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1059.74s)]
*  It was harvest time when we arrived [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1065.74s)]
*  and dozens of monks were hard at work [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1068.26s)]
*  in the olive groves on the hills overlooking the monastery. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1070.3400000000001s)]
*  That's where we ran into Father Nicodros [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1074.3s)]
*  from Melbourne, Australia. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1076.46s)]
*  This place looks like a summer resort, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1078.6200000000001s)]
*  like a holiday resort. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1081.78s)]
*  It sure does. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1083.1000000000001s)]
*  Like a retreat, but it's not. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1083.94s)]
*  It's an arena. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1085.42s)]
*  It's an arena? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1086.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1087.3400000000001s)]
*  What do you mean it's an arena? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1088.18s)]
*  The unseen warfare. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1089.02s)]
*  Unseen warfare? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1089.8600000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1090.8600000000001s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1091.7s)]
*  We fight against the angels of the dark side, you see. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1092.54s)]
*  The devil, Satan. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1095.7s)]
*  The battle against Satan and the dark side [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1100.42s)]
*  is waged here every day. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1102.8200000000002s)]
*  The spiritual leader at Vatopedi is Abbot Afrem. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1107.42s)]
*  Here, the life of Christ is experienced in a genuine way. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1113.42s)]
*  And this doesn't happen in many other places in the world. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1117.3400000000001s)]
*  What I'm talking about is the art of salvation. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1121.5800000000002s)]
*  It just so happened that while we were there, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1125.42s)]
*  the monks celebrated an elaborate seven-hour vigil [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1128.3000000000002s)]
*  and the church was packed with pilgrims. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1132.5800000000002s)]
*  It's held once a year to honor the archangels, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1137.3400000000001s)]
*  Gabriel and Michael. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1140.5s)]
*  According to the Bible, Gabriel and Michael [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1145.7s)]
*  led the army of angels that expelled Satan from heaven. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1148.46s)]
*  The church's relics are brought out every day [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1160.02s)]
*  and pilgrims ask for the blessing of the saints. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1162.94s)]
*  The most sacred relic on the entire peninsula [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1167.02s)]
*  is in this case, fabric said to be part of a garment [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1169.98s)]
*  worn by the Virgin Mary. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1174.02s)]
*  The irony is that while the mother of God is revered here, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1177.66s)]
*  no other woman is permitted to even set foot on Mount Dattos. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1181.54s)]
*  It's been like that for a thousand years. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1185.94s)]
*  The reason, according to Orthodox doctrine, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1189.66s)]
*  is that Christ gave the peninsula to his mother [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1192.6200000000001s)]
*  and all other women have been excluded [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1195.5s)]
*  so as to fully honor the Virgin Mary. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1197.82s)]
*  It's also been said that in the days before the ban, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1200.58s)]
*  when women did come here, the monks became distracted [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1203.7s)]
*  and couldn't devote themselves entirely to prayer. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1207.74s)]
*  They say it's been a lot easier since the last lady left. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1211.18s)]
*  Keeping women out certainly wasn't much of a problem [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1215.8600000000001s)]
*  three, 400 years ago. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1219.98s)]
*  Do you feel that's becoming problematic today? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1221.98s)]
*  I don't think so because the monastery itself [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1226.14s)]
*  and all the land around it is our property [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1228.98s)]
*  and if we don't want women coming onto our property, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1231.66s)]
*  we have every right to do that. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1234.22s)]
*  Mount Dattos may be the last all-male bastion in the world [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1240.5s)]
*  and Father Arsenios says it has to stay that way. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1245.18s)]
*  Here we are concerned solely with purity [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1251.66s)]
*  and our elevation to eternity. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1253.86s)]
*  If women are permitted, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1256.54s)]
*  they'd bring their families and their children. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1257.86s)]
*  This place would become a tourist attraction [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1259.8999999999999s)]
*  and no longer a place of silence. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1262.1s)]
*  If we wanted to experience profound silence, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1266.3799999999999s)]
*  we were advised to go to Stavronikita. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1269.34s)]
*  It's the smallest monastery on the Holy Mountain, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1272.62s)]
*  but it has some of the most remarkable treasures. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1275.4599999999998s)]
*  You stay in the silence just by walking in. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1278.82s)]
*  There's no electricity here, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1284.5s)]
*  so the icons and mosaics are illuminated [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1286.02s)]
*  only by shafts of sunlight and a few candles. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1289.1399999999999s)]
*  St. Nicholas, the patron saint, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1292.78s)]
*  John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1295.06s)]
*  We were stunned by the magnificence of the art here, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1299.02s)]
*  but then we ran into Father Maximus, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1302.4199999999998s)]
*  a former professor at the Harvard Divinity School. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1304.5s)]
*  He told us what we were seeing cannot be described as art. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1307.9799999999998s)]
*  They're devotional objects [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1312.34s)]
*  and they're part of the living liturgical life of the church. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1314.1s)]
*  So we don't have any art and we're not a museum. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1317.1s)]
*  I mean, to put it starkly. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1320.9s)]
*  Whatever you call it, it's priceless. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1323.02s)]
*  That's why the monasteries have been invaded [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1325.7s)]
*  and plundered so many times over the centuries. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1327.86s)]
*  The monks' most recent brush with history [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1331.26s)]
*  happened only 70 years ago. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1333.94s)]
*  The Nazis were coming their way. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1336.02s)]
*  In the spring of 1941, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1338.62s)]
*  the Germans invaded and occupied Greece. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1340.8999999999999s)]
*  They marched up the Acropolis, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1345.02s)]
*  raised the swastika beside the Parthenon [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1346.86s)]
*  and were about to invade. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1349.62s)]
*  The monks asked for a meeting with Nazi officers [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1351.58s)]
*  who advised them to appeal to Hitler himself. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1354.58s)]
*  And the monks wrote a letter to Hitler. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1358.54s)]
*  A letter was written and in the letter, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1360.8999999999999s)]
*  the monks identified themselves. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1363.78s)]
*  They said, this is who we are. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1366.1799999999998s)]
*  And they asked Hitler to place the Holy Mountain [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1367.7s)]
*  under his personal protection. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1372.7s)]
*  What kind of response did you get? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1375.46s)]
*  Well, it seems that Hitler liked the idea [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1378.22s)]
*  and accepted the invitation to become the personal protector [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1381.8600000000001s)]
*  of the Holy Mountain. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1387.22s)]
*  Let me just get that straight. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1388.8600000000001s)]
*  Hitler, the personal protector of the Holy Mountain. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1390.14s)]
*  That's right, that's right. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1394.0600000000002s)]
*  Hitler did send a team of German academics to Mount Athos. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1398.14s)]
*  They took 1800 pictures of the mountain's treasures [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1402.02s)]
*  and it wasn't because they enjoyed photography. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1405.3000000000002s)]
*  Hitler wanted the monastery's riches in Berlin. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1408.22s)]
*  The professors were sent as an advanced team [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1411.66s)]
*  to catalog the treasures of the Holy Mountain [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1415.02s)]
*  so that a selection of things could be made to be removed. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1417.1000000000001s)]
*  Didn't happen, did it? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1420.8600000000001s)]
*  No, it didn't. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1422.5400000000002s)]
*  Not a single thing was taken. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1423.38s)]
*  Father Maximus believes they have the Russians [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1425.62s)]
*  to thank for that. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1428.02s)]
*  That by the time the Nazi scholars completed their work, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1429.4199999999998s)]
*  Hitler was bogged down in Russia [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1432.6599999999999s)]
*  and wasn't thinking about icons. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1434.6999999999998s)]
*  That Nazi period has been largely forgotten here. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1437.3s)]
*  To the monks, it was just one more blip on the road [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1440.5s)]
*  and a small one at that. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1444.3s)]
*  Today, Vatopevi is the most popular destination [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1446.3s)]
*  on the mountain. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1449.02s)]
*  It hosts 35,000 pilgrims a year [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1450.02s)]
*  and offers more than spiritual sustenance. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1453.6999999999998s)]
*  The monks have their own fishing boats [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1456.8999999999999s)]
*  and the catch is pretty good. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1458.4599999999998s)]
*  The fish are served fresher than in any Greek restaurant. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1460.4599999999998s)]
*  The refectory dates from the 12th century [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1464.1s)]
*  and since the 12th century, the food here has been free. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1466.9399999999998s)]
*  Vatopevi has been supported by rich benefactors, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1470.9799999999998s)]
*  emperors, princes, kings, and today, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1474.5s)]
*  partially by pilgrims with deep pockets [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1477.8999999999999s)]
*  who commission icons in the making. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1480.6999999999998s)]
*  But the ancient treasures, not a chance. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1484.1399999999999s)]
*  They can't even see them. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1487.1s)]
*  They're under lock and key. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1489.1799999999998s)]
*  It's not a new security system, but it works. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1491.58s)]
*  Normally, it takes more than one monk to unlock the door [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1494.8999999999999s)]
*  because no one monk is allowed to have all four keys [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1499.4599999999998s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1502.58s)]
*  It's sort of a medieval version [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1504.8999999999999s)]
*  of the nuclear launch control. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1507.1799999999998s)]
*  Do you keep those keys in your pocket, Fonner? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1509.18s)]
*  We try not to. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1512.18s)]
*  Father Matthew from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1513.46s)]
*  was given the abbot's blessing [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1516.5800000000002s)]
*  to let us into the inner sanctum. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1518.18s)]
*  Once inside, there was still another hidden door. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1520.3400000000001s)]
*  Behind the curtain. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1524.3s)]
*  We walked into the world of Byzantium. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1528.1000000000001s)]
*  It was hard to imagine that everything here [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1531.1000000000001s)]
*  was at least 600 years old. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1533.46s)]
*  Because the brilliance had not faded. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1536.06s)]
*  There are almost 4,000 icons stored [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1538.34s)]
*  in this monastery alone. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1540.98s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1542.82s)]
*  The highlight, a 14th century icon of Christ. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1543.66s)]
*  Every monk will tell you the sole purpose of life [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1549.1399999999999s)]
*  on Mount Athos is to get closer to Christ every day. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1552.18s)]
*  And they say total union with Christ [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1556.3s)]
*  is only possible when they leave this world. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1558.74s)]
*  But on Mount Athos, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1561.78s)]
*  it is only possible when they leave this world. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1563.22s)]
*  The first thing a monk does is embrace and love death. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1569.3s)]
*  Embrace and love death. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1572.5800000000002s)]
*  Because death is the ticket to the other life. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1575.74s)]
*  Without a ticket, you can't travel. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1578.22s)]
*  Where do you get the ticket? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1580.22s)]
*  In this life. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1582.8200000000002s)]
*  That's what we do each day. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1584.1000000000001s)]
*  We prepare for death. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1585.6200000000001s)]
*  And we are joyful about our journey to heaven. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1588.54s)]
*  Father Matthew offered to take us to the transit point [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1591.58s)]
*  between this world and heaven. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1595.5s)]
*  When a monk dies, he's buried [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1597.6599999999999s)]
*  until there's nothing left but bones. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1599.54s)]
*  Then he's brought to where every monk [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1602.1799999999998s)]
*  who's ever lived here ends up, the ossuary. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1603.9399999999998s)]
*  Any idea how many skulls there are here? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1607.86s)]
*  Thousands, I'm not sure how many thousands. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1610.46s)]
*  Any idea how far they go back? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1612.5s)]
*  The ones here would be to the 16th century. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1615.02s)]
*  When you look at the ossuary, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1619.34s)]
*  what comes to mind? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1621.4199999999998s)]
*  Mostly I see that this is where I'm going to be. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1622.26s)]
*  I always like to say these are my future roommates. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1626.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1628.6999999999998s)]
*  There was nowhere for us to go from there. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1629.6999999999998s)]
*  So we headed back to the mainland. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1633.02s)]
*  The monks invited us to come back any time. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1635.4599999999998s)]
*  And if we do, or if our grandsons or great-grandsons do, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1638.4599999999998s)]
*  after 10 days here, this much we believe. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1642.9399999999998s)]
*  Mount Athos will not have changed at all. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1646.34s)]
*  The [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1650.62s)]
*  Mount Athos [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1654.8799999999999s)]
*  With a grueling pandemic and gruesome political season, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1663.2199999999998s)]
*  you'd be forgiven for giving up on the idea of miracles. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1666.8999999999999s)]
*  But tonight we will take you [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1670.7399999999998s)]
*  to a place that's known for them. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1672.3s)]
*  The sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in Southern France [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1674.6599999999999s)]
*  is the site of 70 medical miracles [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1677.86s)]
*  recognized by the Catholic Church. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1680.3799999999999s)]
*  The Marian Shrine is famous to the faithful, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1683.06s)]
*  but less well-known is the Lord's Office [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1686.06s)]
*  of Medical Observations. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1688.5s)]
*  That's where world-renowned doctors and researchers [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1690.4199999999998s)]
*  conduct decade-long investigations [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1693.46s)]
*  into the countless claims of cures reported over the years. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1695.98s)]
*  They determine which cases can be medically explained [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1700.1799999999998s)]
*  and which cannot. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1703.3999999999999s)]
*  It's those Church officials might call a miracle. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1704.76s)]
*  For the doctors, it's a lesson in the limits of medicine. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1708.76s)]
*  For the devout, it's divine intervention. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1712.2s)]
*  The small French town of Lourdes, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1718.92s)]
*  tucked in the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1720.84s)]
*  draws more than three million pilgrims every year, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1724.6s)]
*  more than travel to Mecca or Jerusalem. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1728.4s)]
*  And almost everyone you meet will tell you [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1731.72s)]
*  that they've heard stories of miracles here. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1735.18s)]
*  But we've heard none more inspiring [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1737.8s)]
*  than that of Sister Bernadette Moriot. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1740.28s)]
*  I really tried everything I could, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1744.84s)]
*  but this is something that cannot be healed. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1747.2s)]
*  What was your prognosis? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1750.96s)]
*  Full total paralysis. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1753.8799999999999s)]
*  The prognosis was really dark. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1755.8s)]
*  Strolling with 83-year-old Sister Moriot [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1758.98s)]
*  through the chapel grounds in Brel, France, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1762.04s)]
*  we found it hard to believe that for half her life, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1764.88s)]
*  she suffered from cauda equina, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1768.56s)]
*  a disorder of the nerves and lower spine. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1771.0s)]
*  You wore this all the time. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1773.68s)]
*  Her left foot, she said, was twisted and limp. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1775.16s)]
*  To walk at all, she needed this back and leg brace, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1779.4s)]
*  an implant to dull nerve pain, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1782.96s)]
*  and massive doses of morphine. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1785.24s)]
*  She told us she had exhausted all treatment options, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1787.76s)]
*  so in 2008, her doctor convinced her [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1791.5600000000002s)]
*  to make a pilgrimage to Lourdes. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1794.64s)]
*  Did you believe in miracles at the time? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1797.48s)]
*  I always believed in miracles, but not for me. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1799.76s)]
*  So why did you decide to go? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1802.64s)]
*  Well, I didn't go there for a miracle. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1805.72s)]
*  I just went there to pray with others. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1807.6000000000001s)]
*  Lourdes is a place where the smallest people, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1810.0s)]
*  all the sickest, all the poorest, they come first. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1812.3600000000001s)]
*  The sickest, the poorest, the diseased and debilitated, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1817.68s)]
*  bearing wounds visible and hidden, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1822.68s)]
*  come from all over the world, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1825.2s)]
*  seeking to be healed by the shrine's natural spring waters [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1827.2s)]
*  and the power of prayer. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1831.2s)]
*  Amen. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1832.96s)]
*  And so I've asked for complete healing [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1833.96s)]
*  or a super long remission. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1837.16s)]
*  This was Kim Halpin's first pilgrimage. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1840.88s)]
*  She found the place to pray, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1844.16s)]
*  and she was able to make a pilgrimage. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1846.64s)]
*  She found out last year she has incurable blood cancer [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1848.64s)]
*  and came all the way from Kansas [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1852.64s)]
*  to cleanse herself in the waters of Lourdes. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1854.64s)]
*  Are you expecting to be healed? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1858.64s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1861.64s)]
*  Ask for as much as I want, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1863.64s)]
*  and maybe I will be blessed with part of it, which will be OK. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1865.64s)]
*  Halpin was aided by her son, Sean. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1870.64s)]
*  There are as many volunteers as sick here. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1874.1200000000001s)]
*  The Our Lady of Lourdes Hospitality North American volunteers [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1877.1200000000001s)]
*  helped Jamie Jensen travel from Minnesota for his 18th visit. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1881.1200000000001s)]
*  Even though the camera sees that I have a condition and a chair, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1886.1200000000001s)]
*  when I'm here, I don't have a condition. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1893.1200000000001s)]
*  Jensen's condition is cerebral palsy. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1899.1200000000001s)]
*  All those trips to Lourdes [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1902.6s)]
*  haven't given him the physical miracle he wanted, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1904.6s)]
*  but maybe, he says, he got the miracle he needed. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1907.6s)]
*  I was very bitter, very angry with myself. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1911.6s)]
*  Did coming to Lourdes change your heart? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1916.6s)]
*  Very much. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1920.6s)]
*  Do you consider that a miracle? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1922.6s)]
*  I do because there's a peace within myself. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1924.6s)]
*  Stories of inner peace and acceptance [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1932.08s)]
*  don't meet the bar for the Office of Medical Observations, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1935.08s)]
*  and with just 70 medical miracles recognized in 160 years, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1939.08s)]
*  you'd have better odds playing the lotto. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1943.08s)]
*  Yet thousands of faithful line up at the baths and at this grotto [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1946.08s)]
*  where the first miracle is said to have occurred. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1951.08s)]
*  The sanctuary, with its three basilicas and 25 chapels, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1955.08s)]
*  is laid out like a grand theatre complex, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1960.56s)]
*  its many stages offering dozens of highest performances [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1963.56s)]
*  throughout the day. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1967.56s)]
*  The finale, a candle-lit procession every night. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1970.56s)]
*  There would be none of this were it not for Saint Bernadette. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1980.56s)]
*  According to Catholic lore, in 1850, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1985.56s)]
*  a mysterious woman appeared in this grotto to Bernadette Suburu, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1989.04s)]
*  a 14-year-old peasant girl. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1994.04s)]
*  Jean-Marc Bica, the Bishop of Lourdes, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=1997.04s)]
*  says the woman spoke with Suburu several times over five months. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2000.04s)]
*  And once, the 25th of March, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2005.04s)]
*  the day of the Annunciation, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2008.04s)]
*  she said, I am the Immaculate Conception. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2011.04s)]
*  When word got out the Immaculate Conception, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2016.52s)]
*  the Virgin Mary had appeared in Lourdes, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2019.52s)]
*  people flocked to this grotto and within days [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2022.52s)]
*  started making claims of miracle cures, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2025.52s)]
*  the ability to walk, restored sight. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2028.52s)]
*  Worried about fueling mass hysteria, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2031.52s)]
*  the Church set up the Office of Medical Observations in 1883 [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2034.52s)]
*  to investigate the claims. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2038.52s)]
*  Which brings us back to the other Bernadette and Suburu, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2041.52s)]
*  in our story. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2046.0s)]
*  14 years ago, Sister Morio found herself in a wheelchair [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2047.0s)]
*  in a procession at Lourdes, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2052.0s)]
*  seeking the intervention of Saint Bernadette. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2054.0s)]
*  And I really had that feeling that the Lord was walking with us. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2057.0s)]
*  And I heard him giving me these words, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2061.0s)]
*  I see your suffering and that of your sick brothers and sisters. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2063.0s)]
*  Just give me everything. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2067.0s)]
*  You heard the voice of Jesus. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2068.0s)]
*  Yes, I heard this in a voice. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2071.0s)]
*  I can't really tell you whose voice it was. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2074.48s)]
*  It was like a spiritual experience. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2076.48s)]
*  She said she returned home rejuvenated spiritually, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2079.48s)]
*  but physically she felt worse. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2083.48s)]
*  After three days in excruciating pain, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2085.48s)]
*  she told us she suddenly found the strength [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2088.48s)]
*  to walk to the chapel and pray. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2091.48s)]
*  Then I felt some kind of heat coming into my body. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2094.48s)]
*  I felt relaxed, but I didn't really know what that was meaning. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2098.48s)]
*  And in my room, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2102.96s)]
*  I heard this in a voice again telling me, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2103.96s)]
*  take all your braces off. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2105.96s)]
*  I didn't think twice, and I started taking my foot brace off. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2107.96s)]
*  And my foot, that used to be crooked, was straight. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2111.96s)]
*  And I could actually put it on the ground without feeling any pain. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2114.96s)]
*  All of a sudden your foot was straight? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2118.96s)]
*  Yes, like that. Like the way it is just now. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2120.96s)]
*  And so I kept going. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2123.96s)]
*  She says she took off the braces and stopped the morphine all at once. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2125.96s)]
*  Did this make sense to you? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2131.44s)]
*  No, I knew it was impossible. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2133.44s)]
*  She came to my door with her doctor, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2136.44s)]
*  and she said, last year I came to Lourdes on pilgrimage, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2139.44s)]
*  and three days after I got back home, I was cured. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2142.44s)]
*  Dr Alessandro Di Franchicis hears stories like that all the time. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2145.44s)]
*  As the president and residing physician [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2150.44s)]
*  at the Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2153.44s)]
*  the former pediatrician's job is to determine [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2155.44s)]
*  whether there is more to those stories [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2158.44s)]
*  by applying seven strict criteria established by the Church. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2160.92s)]
*  And we're looking for a diagnosis. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2164.92s)]
*  And if that diagnosis is a diagnosis of a severe disease [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2167.92s)]
*  with a severe prognosis, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2171.92s)]
*  and then we want to make sure that that person is a person [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2173.92s)]
*  that was cured in a way that one would say suddenly, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2176.92s)]
*  in an instantaneous way, in a complete way, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2180.92s)]
*  and in a way lasting in time. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2184.92s)]
*  And my seventh criteria that has to match [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2186.92s)]
*  must be no possible explanation to that cure. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2190.4s)]
*  Sister Benedetta Morio. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2194.4s)]
*  Here on the end. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2196.4s)]
*  He showed us the archives, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2197.4s)]
*  which hold thousands of recorded claims of cures. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2199.4s)]
*  This feels like it's almost ten pounds. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2202.4s)]
*  Dr Di Franchicis, a practicing Catholic, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2204.4s)]
*  told us what separates the more than 7,000 claims of cures [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2207.4s)]
*  from the 70 the Church calls miracles [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2212.4s)]
*  is an ungodly amount of medical documentation. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2214.4s)]
*  And patients like Sister Morio, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2218.88s)]
*  willing to put their lives under a microscope. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2220.88s)]
*  We sent her to two different neurologists. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2224.88s)]
*  We sent her to different rheumatologists [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2226.88s)]
*  because of the different specific case of her disease. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2229.88s)]
*  We asked to repeat twice all sorts of imagery, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2232.88s)]
*  electrophysiology. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2235.88s)]
*  We did all that we would do in medicine [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2237.88s)]
*  to be absolutely sure of her diagnosis. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2239.88s)]
*  And it was. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2241.88s)]
*  But he wanted to confirm something else. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2242.88s)]
*  I was asked to meet with two psychiatrists in Paris. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2246.36s)]
*  They wanted to know if I was lying. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2251.36s)]
*  If I had already had any hallucinations. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2255.36s)]
*  If I had levitated. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2258.36s)]
*  I remember answering, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2260.36s)]
*  no doctor, I never left the ground floor. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2262.36s)]
*  Satisfied, Dr Di Franchicis sent Sister Morio's case [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2266.36s)]
*  to a group of 33 doctors and professors [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2271.36s)]
*  called the International Medical Committee of Lords. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2274.84s)]
*  Its job is to determine whether a cure [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2277.84s)]
*  is what they consider medically unexplained. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2280.84s)]
*  We're not trying to reel something in [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2283.84s)]
*  or reel something out, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2285.84s)]
*  we're just trying to be objective. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2286.84s)]
*  You could call them the devil's advocates. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2288.84s)]
*  Dr Michael Moran, a surgical oncologist. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2290.84s)]
*  Dr Jacek Mostwin, a professor of urology at Johns Hopkins. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2294.84s)]
*  And Dr Kieran Moriarty, a renowned addiction specialist, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2298.84s)]
*  scrutinized Sister Morio's case. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2303.32s)]
*  Is there anything that could have caused her response? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2306.32s)]
*  No treatment would be that effective that quickly. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2314.32s)]
*  Does religion enter into your medical conversation? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2318.32s)]
*  We cannot separate ourselves as people [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2322.32s)]
*  who have been deeply immersed in the culture [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2325.32s)]
*  and the traditions of lords in the church. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2328.32s)]
*  But make no mistake, we're just as technical [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2330.8s)]
*  as a forensic pathologist when it comes to looking [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2333.8s)]
*  at the technical details of the case. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2335.8s)]
*  After eight years of investigation, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2337.8s)]
*  the committee determined that Sister Morio's case [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2340.8s)]
*  was medically unexplained. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2343.8s)]
*  So when you do a survey, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2345.8s)]
*  the investigation of Sister Bernadette's [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2347.8s)]
*  or any of the other cures, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2350.8s)]
*  this is done on a purely medical basis, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2352.8s)]
*  something that could be peer reviewed [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2356.8s)]
*  by other physicians outside of our peer review. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2359.28s)]
*  Not could, that is. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2361.28s)]
*  I can affirm with absolute certainty [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2363.28s)]
*  that the case of Sister Bernadette [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2368.28s)]
*  had been reviewed, read, expertise [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2370.28s)]
*  by at least 300 physicians. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2372.28s)]
*  And if tomorrow morning any of our viewers is a doctor [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2378.28s)]
*  and one day he stops in Southern France [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2382.28s)]
*  and comes to see me and wants to look into the file [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2384.28s)]
*  of Sister Bernadette, I'll be delighted to show him [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2387.76s)]
*  because we have, everything is open [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2390.76s)]
*  and collegial and no secrets. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2393.76s)]
*  The secret is the mystery of it all. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2396.76s)]
*  And on that, the church gets the last word. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2399.76s)]
*  In 2018, a decade after her cure, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2402.76s)]
*  Sister Morio's case was declared [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2405.76s)]
*  the 70th miracle of lords. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2408.76s)]
*  Declaring a miracle is saying God did something. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2411.76s)]
*  This is the miracle. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2417.2400000000002s)]
*  And the doctors cannot go on that land, on that field. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2419.2400000000002s)]
*  When I told people I was coming here, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2423.2400000000002s)]
*  I got a lot of people who told me, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2425.2400000000002s)]
*  oh, come on, there's gotta be some explanation [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2428.2400000000002s)]
*  that we just don't know. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2430.2400000000002s)]
*  What do you say to the skeptics? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2432.2400000000002s)]
*  Come and see. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2434.2400000000002s)]
*  Be open. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2436.2400000000002s)]
*  Don't be narrow-minded. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2438.2400000000002s)]
*  Be open to believe that the real world [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2440.2400000000002s)]
*  is wider than the visible one. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2443.2400000000002s)]
*  It's been said about lords for those who believe [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2447.2400000000002s)]
*  no explanation is necessary. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2452.2400000000002s)]
*  For those who do not, no explanation is possible. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2455.2400000000002s)]
*  This story is about a man who was a Christian [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2464.2400000000002s)]
*  who was a Christian and he was a Christian. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2469.2400000000002s)]
*  This Christmas season brings fresh hope [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2473.72s)]
*  with vaccines rolling out and a new year dawning. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2476.72s)]
*  It's a time of faith and reminded us [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2479.72s)]
*  of Lalabella, a monument to rare devotion. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2482.72s)]
*  800 years ago, an Ethiopian king [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2486.72s)]
*  ordered a new capital for Christians. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2489.72s)]
*  On the central plateau of Ethiopia stand 11 churches, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2492.72s)]
*  each carved from a single gigantic stone [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2497.72s)]
*  no bricks, no mortar, no concrete, no lumber, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2502.2s)]
*  just rock sculpted into architecture. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2505.2s)]
*  As we first told you last Christmas, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2509.2s)]
*  not much is known about who built them or how, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2511.2s)]
*  but the faithful of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2514.2s)]
*  say there's no mystery really. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2517.2s)]
*  The churches of Lalabella were built by angels. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2520.2s)]
*  The northern highlands of Ethiopia [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2526.2s)]
*  rose 31 million years ago when fissures in the earth [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2528.68s)]
*  flooded the Horn of Africa with lava a mile deep. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2533.68s)]
*  On hillsides you can still see [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2537.68s)]
*  columns of lava frozen in time. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2539.68s)]
*  Iron made the basalt red and gases trapped inside [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2542.68s)]
*  made the stone light, as light and pliable as air. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2547.68s)]
*  Christians laid their mark on the ground [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2553.68s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2557.16s)]
*  The Christians laid their mark on Ethiopia [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2558.16s)]
*  before the year 400. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2560.16s)]
*  They found the ancient stone [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2562.16s)]
*  welcomed the bite of a chisel. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2564.16s)]
*  The churches were carved around the year 1200 [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2567.16s)]
*  by people called the Zagwe. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2570.16s)]
*  Their king, Lalabella, is said to have traveled [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2573.16s)]
*  the 1600 miles to Jerusalem. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2576.16s)]
*  Legend has it when he returned [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2579.16s)]
*  and Jerusalem fell to the Islamic conquest, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2581.16s)]
*  Lalabella ordered a new home for Christianity. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2584.64s)]
*  And he came back with an ambitious idea [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2587.64s)]
*  or vision of creating an African Jerusalem, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2590.64s)]
*  a black Jerusalem here in the highlands of Ethiopia. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2595.64s)]
*  Fasel Georgis is an Ethiopian architect and historian [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2599.64s)]
*  who walked us through the Rock of Ages. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2602.64s)]
*  Well, there are three groups of churches [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2605.64s)]
*  and each group is interconnected within itself. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2608.64s)]
*  We're sitting in St. Mary's Church. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2612.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2615.12s)]
*  How was it built? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2616.12s)]
*  Well, it was built starting from outside. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2617.12s)]
*  They formed the shape and then they start digging [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2621.12s)]
*  or let's say excavating downwards. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2624.12s)]
*  So they dug essentially a trench [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2627.12s)]
*  around the whole perimeter. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2629.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2630.12s)]
*  Which left them with a giant cube of solid rock. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2631.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2634.12s)]
*  And then they carved their doors and in they went. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2635.12s)]
*  In they went. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2638.12s)]
*  Chipping inside, Lalabella, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2639.12s)]
*  largely in darkness, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2641.6s)]
*  artists sculpted many rooms with no room for error. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2643.6s)]
*  Archways, vaults and columns imitate traditional construction [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2647.6s)]
*  even though in solid rock, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2652.6s)]
*  there's no need to hold up the ceiling. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2654.6s)]
*  The enduring mystery is why. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2657.6s)]
*  Why did King Lalabella attempt the seemingly impossible [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2660.6s)]
*  when easier building techniques were known? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2664.6s)]
*  As the story goes, he was helped by angels. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2667.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2671.08s)]
*  Who worked on the project overnight. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2672.08s)]
*  I think I would rather take this as a symbolic thing because... [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2673.08s)]
*  Do you not have any experience [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2677.08s)]
*  working with angels in architecture? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2679.08s)]
*  Well, I get inspiration from angels. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2681.08s)]
*  The site of the 11 churches covers about 62 acres. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2687.08s)]
*  It's divided by a stream. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2690.08s)]
*  King Lalabella christened the River Jordan. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2692.08s)]
*  The largest church covers around 8,000 square feet. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2695.56s)]
*  Each is about four stories tall. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2699.56s)]
*  But their most astounding dimension cannot be measured. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2702.56s)]
*  It is the length to which they summon adoration. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2708.56s)]
*  This is considered to be a holy place. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2715.56s)]
*  That coming here as a devout Christian [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2718.56s)]
*  is a very strong sign of the Holy Spirit. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2721.56s)]
*  It's a sign of their belief. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2725.04s)]
*  Some people travel hundreds of kilometers to get here. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2727.04s)]
*  On foot. On foot. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2730.04s)]
*  And they have been doing it for several centuries. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2732.04s)]
*  The churches are open for worship year-round. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2738.04s)]
*  But we were there Christmas Eve, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2741.04s)]
*  when nearly 200,000 pilgrims rose to heaven [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2743.04s)]
*  on a path descending into the earth. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2747.04s)]
*  Many walked for days or weeks, fasting, robed in white. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2750.52s)]
*  An ordeal that is rinsed from the disciples [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2756.52s)]
*  in the tradition of Jesus. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2759.52s)]
*  Any Ethiopian over the age of 30 [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2765.52s)]
*  cannot forget the suffering of drought and war [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2768.52s)]
*  and a million people lost to starvation. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2772.52s)]
*  And so, having known poverty in this life, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2775.52s)]
*  they've invested their souls in the next. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2779.0s)]
*  Tewolda Yigzao told us, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2783.0s)]
*  I believe God is here. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2785.0s)]
*  I came with faith. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2787.0s)]
*  Her neighbor, Gaitie Ababao, and his daughter [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2789.0s)]
*  told us they walked from their farms [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2793.0s)]
*  nearly a hundred miles away, a journey of three days. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2795.0s)]
*  God can hear your prayers anywhere. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2800.0s)]
*  Why did you feel you had to be here? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2802.0s)]
*  So that God can see our devotion, she said. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2805.0s)]
*  And our dedication. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2808.48s)]
*  We were very tired, he said. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2811.48s)]
*  We were falling and getting back up throughout the journey, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2813.48s)]
*  all to see the celebration here. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2816.48s)]
*  And God will recognize our effort. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2819.48s)]
*  The Christmas celebration Ethiopians call Genna [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2832.48s)]
*  compresses them shoulder to shoulder [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2835.96s)]
*  to fast and chant and praise all night [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2837.96s)]
*  till dawn brings Christmas Day. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2841.96s)]
*  The Ethiopian Orthodox Church [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2846.96s)]
*  claims to be among the earliest capitals of Christianity [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2848.96s)]
*  thanks to a mysterious figure of the Hebrew Bible. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2852.96s)]
*  The faithful believe that the Queen of Sheba [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2857.96s)]
*  left Ethiopia, went to Jerusalem, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2860.96s)]
*  where she met King Solomon. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2864.44s)]
*  From that meeting came a son. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2866.44s)]
*  And when the son was an adult, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2868.44s)]
*  he returned to Ethiopia with 12,000 Israelites [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2870.44s)]
*  and the Ark of the Covenant, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2874.44s)]
*  containing the tablets with the Word of God, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2876.44s)]
*  the Ten Commandments. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2880.44s)]
*  And the Ark remains in Ethiopia, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2882.44s)]
*  according to the priests of the Orthodox Church. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2884.44s)]
*  We met Tage Saleh Mazgabu, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2889.44s)]
*  the head priest of Lalabela [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2891.92s)]
*  at the Church of St. George, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2894.92s)]
*  which was last to be built and judged to be the masterpiece. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2896.92s)]
*  I met a woman on Christmas Day [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2901.92s)]
*  who had spent three days walking here. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2903.92s)]
*  Who are these pilgrims? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2906.92s)]
*  These are believers, he told us. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2909.92s)]
*  Not just three days, even three months sometimes. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2911.92s)]
*  When there was no air travel or buses, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2921.92s)]
*  people used to travel from various parts of the country [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2923.92s)]
*  for months to come here and celebrate with us. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2926.92s)]
*  The celebration beats to the rhythm of ancient instruments, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2935.92s)]
*  the cabaro, double-headed drum, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2939.92s)]
*  and a rattle called the cistern, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2942.92s)]
*  whose sound was known in North Africa [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2945.92s)]
*  3,000 years before Jesus. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2947.92s)]
*  On Christmas Eve, we watched you and your priests [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2951.92s)]
*  lead the chant all night long. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2955.92s)]
*  What are you saying in that chant? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2958.92s)]
*  We tell the people that God became human, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2961.92s)]
*  and a human became God. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2964.92s)]
*  Because of Christ, we went from being punished by God [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2968.92s)]
*  to being his children again. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2970.92s)]
*  Christmas is the day that forgiveness was born. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2975.92s)]
*  But while God forgives, time does not. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2980.4s)]
*  After eight centuries, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2984.4s)]
*  the basalt basilicas are weary of wind and water. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2986.4s)]
*  What's absolutely clear is that [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2990.4s)]
*  something quite miraculous happened here. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2992.4s)]
*  Stephen Battle is an architect [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2994.4s)]
*  with the World Monuments Fund, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2996.4s)]
*  who told us Lalabella's miracle is being undermined [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=2998.4s)]
*  because the rock is not rock solid. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3002.4s)]
*  When you're building a conventional building, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3005.4s)]
*  you go to a quarry, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3007.4s)]
*  and you'll have different grades of stone, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3009.88s)]
*  and you try and select the best stone, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3011.88s)]
*  and you leave the bad stuff behind. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3013.88s)]
*  When you're carving a church out of the mountainside, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3015.88s)]
*  you don't have that luxury. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3018.88s)]
*  And so typically in any one of the churches here, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3020.88s)]
*  you get good stone, and a lot of it is good stone, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3023.88s)]
*  but then you also get actually bad stone, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3026.88s)]
*  and actually very bad stone, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3029.88s)]
*  which is really very soft indeed, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3031.88s)]
*  and over time, if you touch it, it actually crumbles. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3033.88s)]
*  And this is one of the most sacred parts of Lalabella. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3035.88s)]
*  We saw the good and the bad [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3039.36s)]
*  in the chamber where King Lalabella is laid to rest. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3041.36s)]
*  This is one of the best preserved sculptures [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3045.36s)]
*  I've seen at Lalabella. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3048.36s)]
*  Yes, this is particularly beautiful, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3050.36s)]
*  and they're also painted. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3052.36s)]
*  Simon Warwick is a master stone mason, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3053.36s)]
*  also with the World Monuments Fund, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3056.36s)]
*  a U.S.-based charity that preserves [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3058.36s)]
*  some of humankind's great achievements. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3061.36s)]
*  Obviously, we worked on the roof first. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3063.36s)]
*  Warwick has repaired European cathedrals [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3065.36s)]
*  and Roman antiquities, but Lalabella is more complicated [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3067.84s)]
*  because of the sincere belief that angels worked this stone. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3071.84s)]
*  Simon, you can't actually cut this stone [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3077.84s)]
*  in order to fit a new piece in, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3079.84s)]
*  because the stone you would be cutting is sacred. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3081.84s)]
*  Yeah, this was one of the first big issues [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3084.84s)]
*  that I came across. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3087.84s)]
*  If we ever had to drill a hole to strengthen it, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3089.84s)]
*  put in a pin, we had to discuss it with the priests. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3091.84s)]
*  They collected the dust. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3094.84s)]
*  There was a whole procedure [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3097.32s)]
*  around touching the fabric of the church. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3099.32s)]
*  The priest collected the dust? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3102.32s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3104.32s)]
*  That was the issue when Warwick was asked [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3106.32s)]
*  to resurrect the cross in this window [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3108.32s)]
*  without disturbing the fragment that remained. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3111.32s)]
*  So this cross wasn't here? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3114.32s)]
*  It was completely gone, yes. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3116.32s)]
*  It was a very, very thin piece of stone remaining. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3118.32s)]
*  So I hollowed out the back of the cross shape [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3120.32s)]
*  that we were inserting, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3123.32s)]
*  and it was fitting over the original stone [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3125.8s)]
*  a bit like a dentist. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3127.8s)]
*  And so we were able to conserve this tiny bit of stone, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3129.8s)]
*  which is, in stone masonry terms, it's crazy. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3132.8s)]
*  But you have to do that in this kind of situation. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3136.8s)]
*  There have been other crazy conservation ideas. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3139.8s)]
*  A dozen years ago, five umbrellas were built [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3142.8s)]
*  to keep the heavens from pouring down. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3146.8s)]
*  The local people call them gas station roofs. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3149.8s)]
*  And I think it's a pretty apt way of describing them. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3154.28s)]
*  So you can imagine, we have this extraordinary site [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3157.28s)]
*  with some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3159.28s)]
*  with extraordinary huge spiritual significance, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3161.28s)]
*  and there's a bunch of gas station roofs [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3164.28s)]
*  that have been placed over the top of them. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3166.28s)]
*  It's really not compatible, it's not appropriate. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3168.28s)]
*  Unholy to behold, the roofs became a lesson [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3171.28s)]
*  in the law of unintended consequences. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3174.28s)]
*  The churches were too wet, now they're too dry. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3177.28s)]
*  For the first time in 900 years, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3181.28s)]
*  the roof was completely covered by the sand being rained on. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3183.76s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3185.76s)]
*  And so the stone is contracting much more [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3186.76s)]
*  than it has ever done before. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3189.76s)]
*  And what happens is this creates little failures [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3191.76s)]
*  on a micro level, and the stone starts to crumble. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3193.76s)]
*  The roofs were meant to be temporary, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3196.76s)]
*  and in a few years, they must be recovered. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3198.76s)]
*  Stephen Battle prays they'll be removed altogether [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3201.76s)]
*  and replaced by intensive maintenance. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3204.76s)]
*  To that end, the World Monuments Fund is teaching conservation [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3208.76s)]
*  as well as priests and laymen in the hope that a host [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3213.2400000000002s)]
*  can protect the heavenly, perhaps for centuries to come. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3216.2400000000002s)]
*  How long can they last? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3221.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, another 900 years if they're looked after properly. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3223.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh yes, we're beyond a shadow of a doubt, absolutely, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3226.2400000000002s)]
*  if they're looked after correctly. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3228.2400000000002s)]
*  Even beyond another millennia, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3231.2400000000002s)]
*  we're not likely to know with certainty the answer to why. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3234.2400000000002s)]
*  Why attempt what must have seemed impossible? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3238.2400000000002s)]
*  No answer was apparent until we chipped away [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3242.72s)]
*  at what we saw Christmas day. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3245.72s)]
*  In the Old Testament, Isaiah advises those who seek God [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3248.72s)]
*  to look to the rock from which you were cut [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3253.72s)]
*  and the quarry from which you were hewn. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3256.72s)]
*  Whoever cut this rock, angels or man, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3259.72s)]
*  understood that in the presence of a miracle, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3262.72s)]
*  faith is never washed away. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3266.72s)]
*  We're about to visit a place few people have seen firsthand, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3270.2s)]
*  the Vatican Library, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3273.2s)]
*  a vast collection of historic treasures beyond compare. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3275.2s)]
*  Founded over five centuries ago, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3279.2s)]
*  when Europe was coming out of the Dark Ages, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3281.2s)]
*  a period of so much destruction that it was almost impossible [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3284.2s)]
*  to find a place to live. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3287.2s)]
*  The Vatican Library is a place where [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3289.2s)]
*  the most important historical and historical relics [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3291.2s)]
*  are found. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3294.2s)]
*  When Europe was coming out of the Dark Ages, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3296.68s)]
*  a period of so-called humanism, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3298.68s)]
*  when the Catholic Church was open to new ideas [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3301.68s)]
*  in philosophy, science and the human spirit. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3303.68s)]
*  It's the Pope's library, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3307.68s)]
*  but it contains much more than just church documents. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3309.68s)]
*  There are manuscripts going back nearly 2,000 years [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3312.68s)]
*  on music and math, warfare and exploration, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3315.68s)]
*  even cookbooks and love letters. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3318.68s)]
*  The library is closed to the public, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3321.68s)]
*  a place for scholars only. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3323.68s)]
*  But the Vatican agreed to let us in [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3326.16s)]
*  to see some of the priceless artifacts [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3328.16s)]
*  of our collective past. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3331.16s)]
*  Welcome to the 15th century. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3339.16s)]
*  In Rome, turn a corner and you bump into antiquity, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3341.16s)]
*  a delicious mixed salad of present and past. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3345.16s)]
*  We arrived at the Vatican [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3349.16s)]
*  to find a medieval costume parade in progress. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3351.16s)]
*  What better way to begin a trek through history? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3354.64s)]
*  There's about 2 million printed books. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3358.64s)]
*  2 million printed books. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3360.64s)]
*  And inside the library, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3362.64s)]
*  the past surrounded us again [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3364.64s)]
*  as we were shown the magnificent building [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3366.64s)]
*  and its riches. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3369.64s)]
*  This is the Urbino Bible. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3371.64s)]
*  For instance, this spectacular Bible [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3373.64s)]
*  commissioned in 1476 by the Duke of Urbino. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3375.64s)]
*  He wanted to have a very fancy Bible. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3379.64s)]
*  And this is what he got. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3382.12s)]
*  Library curator Timothy Janz tells us [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3385.12s)]
*  the Bible took years to make by hand, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3388.12s)]
*  letter by letter, picture by picture. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3391.12s)]
*  Decorated with real gold. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3395.12s)]
*  It's just one of the library's 80,000 [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3397.12s)]
*  handwritten manuscripts [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3400.12s)]
*  from the ages before the printing press. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3402.12s)]
*  Add to that those 2 million or so printed books, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3405.12s)]
*  Christian and pagan, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3408.12s)]
*  sacred and profane, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3410.6s)]
*  in virtually every language known to man. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3412.6s)]
*  There are thousands of prints and drawings. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3416.6s)]
*  Windows on the past. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3420.6s)]
*  And a huge collection of ancient coins. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3424.6s)]
*  This was the money of Palestine 2,000 years ago, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3427.6s)]
*  including the kind of silver coins [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3431.6s)]
*  Judas was said to have been paid to betray Christ. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3433.6s)]
*  Here is a map of the world [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3437.6s)]
*  drawn 50 years before Columbus. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3440.08s)]
*  At its edge, the towers of paradise. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3442.08s)]
*  And an immediate bestseller, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3446.08s)]
*  Columbus's description of his voyage to the new world, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3448.08s)]
*  published in 1493. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3452.08s)]
*  In a certain way, the library is kind of the attic [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3455.08s)]
*  of Western civilization. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3458.08s)]
*  It's so true, and it's like many attics. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3460.08s)]
*  You know, you put things up all the time, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3462.08s)]
*  you keep on pushing over boxes [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3464.08s)]
*  to make space for more things. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3466.08s)]
*  Father Michael Collins is an Irish priest [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3468.56s)]
*  who's written extensively about the Vatican, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3471.56s)]
*  where the library shelves, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3474.56s)]
*  if you put them end to end, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3476.56s)]
*  would stretch for 31 miles. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3478.56s)]
*  Is there anyone, any single person [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3481.56s)]
*  who really knows what the library holds? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3483.56s)]
*  Nobody knows exactly what's there, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3487.56s)]
*  because it would be impossible for the human brain [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3489.56s)]
*  to understand, to remember the titles, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3492.56s)]
*  who wrote it, when they were written. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3494.56s)]
*  It is quite a treasure of the humanity that you have here. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3497.04s)]
*  Monseigneur Cesare Pasini presides over the library. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3503.04s)]
*  Its great hall, essentially unchanged over the centuries, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3507.04s)]
*  is a picture gallery of antiquity. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3511.04s)]
*  Saints, philosophers, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3514.04s)]
*  and depictions of the great libraries [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3516.04s)]
*  of the pre-Christian world. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3518.04s)]
*  Babylon, Athens, Alexandria. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3520.04s)]
*  A shrine to learning and to books. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3523.04s)]
*  There's one person who can actually take a book [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3526.52s)]
*  out of the library, correct? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3529.52s)]
*  Yes, the Pope can have every book in the library. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3531.52s)]
*  If St Peter's Basilica [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3543.52s)]
*  represents the splendour of the church writ large, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3545.52s)]
*  the library nearby is a testament [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3548.52s)]
*  to the monks and scribes [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3551.52s)]
*  who made magnificent miniatures in times past. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3554.0s)]
*  Here, some devotional music [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3559.0s)]
*  commissioned by Pope Leo X. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3561.0s)]
*  And the text of the Christmas Mass [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3564.0s)]
*  used at the altar by Alexander VI. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3566.0s)]
*  Both manuscripts five centuries old, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3570.0s)]
*  written on parchment, treated animal skin. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3573.0s)]
*  You will often see the skin of sheep being used, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3577.0s)]
*  sometimes goats. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3580.0s)]
*  The man who lends the director [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3582.48s)]
*  of the American Academy in Rome [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3584.48s)]
*  is a scholar who's often used the library. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3586.48s)]
*  He says that writing on parchment [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3589.48s)]
*  was not only tedious, but expensive. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3591.48s)]
*  If a monastery wanted to produce a Bible [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3595.48s)]
*  that perhaps had 400 pages, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3598.48s)]
*  it might cost you 400 sheep. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3601.48s)]
*  It's an investment. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3604.48s)]
*  Beyond the academic work, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3606.48s)]
*  did you ever just come here to hang out [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3609.48s)]
*  and step through stuff and see what you might discover? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3611.96s)]
*  I think all of us have come here [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3613.96s)]
*  at one time or another [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3615.96s)]
*  with the hope of discovering something, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3616.96s)]
*  having a general direction in which we're going, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3618.96s)]
*  but not quite knowing where we'll wind up. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3620.96s)]
*  You might find, as curator Adelbert Roth showed us, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3623.96s)]
*  drawings of a German jousting tournament in 1481. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3627.96s)]
*  Or an old cookbook telling us [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3632.96s)]
*  that Roman foodies in the 4th century [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3634.96s)]
*  dined on chicken, veal, seafood, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3636.96s)]
*  pancakes in milk, and whipped pear cake. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3640.44s)]
*  How to hack away at your enemy's wall. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3643.44s)]
*  Or from an 11th century treatise on the art of war, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3646.44s)]
*  a Byzantine soldier brandishing a flamethrower, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3649.44s)]
*  something the Greeks invented 1500 years earlier. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3652.44s)]
*  Or Henry VIII's love letters to Anne Boleyn. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3657.44s)]
*  The letters are certainly among the most bizarre [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3661.44s)]
*  and unusual letters you'd expect to find [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3665.44s)]
*  in the Pope's archives. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3667.44s)]
*  There are 17 of them, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3668.92s)]
*  handwritten by the King of England [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3669.92s)]
*  to the woman he would make the second of his six wives, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3671.92s)]
*  and later have beheaded. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3675.92s)]
*  There's the little heart. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3677.92s)]
*  Henry signs his name with a heart, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3679.92s)]
*  like a smitten schoolboy. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3682.92s)]
*  He tells of his fervence of love, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3684.92s)]
*  his great loneliness without her. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3686.92s)]
*  Wishing myself, he says, in my sweetheart's arms, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3689.92s)]
*  whose pretty duckies I'd trust shortly to kiss. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3693.92s)]
*  Duckies being a term in Henry's day for, well, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3698.4s)]
*  use your imagination. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3701.4s)]
*  What is that doing in the Vatican Library? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3704.4s)]
*  We don't know how they ended up here in the Vatican. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3707.4s)]
*  It may be that some spy, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3710.4s)]
*  maybe one of my priestly predecessors, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3712.4s)]
*  may have stolen these letters and brought them to Rome [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3715.4s)]
*  to present in the case if a trial was made [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3718.4s)]
*  for Henry's request for divorce. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3721.4s)]
*  But the Church refused to let Henry divorce [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3724.4s)]
*  Catherine of Aragon so he could marry Anne. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3727.88s)]
*  He married her anyway, broke with Rome, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3730.88s)]
*  and took control of the Church of England. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3733.88s)]
*  The country was largely converted to the Protestant faith. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3735.88s)]
*  This is one of the moments in the 16th century [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3739.88s)]
*  that leads to the fracturing of Christianity [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3742.88s)]
*  and to much of the bloodshed and the wars [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3745.88s)]
*  that especially the later 16th century was known for. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3748.88s)]
*  As man explored the planet, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3752.36s)]
*  a scientific revolution was also underway. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3754.36s)]
*  By the mid-17th century, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3758.36s)]
*  navigators had mapped much of the world in remarkable detail. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3760.36s)]
*  Rio de Janeiro, Cusco, Mexico City. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3765.36s)]
*  Galileo turned his eyes and his telescope on the heavens. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3770.36s)]
*  Here, from 1612, are his drawings of sunspots. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3774.36s)]
*  For his insistence, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3778.36s)]
*  that the sun is the center of the universe [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3780.84s)]
*  and the Earth moves round it, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3782.84s)]
*  the Church branded him a heretic. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3784.84s)]
*  The Pope at the time, Pope Urban VIII, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3787.84s)]
*  who was a very good friend of Galileo, said to him, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3789.84s)]
*  look, you know, I agree with you, you're right, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3791.84s)]
*  but I can't approve of this because I'm the Pope, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3793.84s)]
*  and if I go against this, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3796.84s)]
*  it looks as if I'm going against the Bible [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3798.84s)]
*  and I'm going to shake to the foundation [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3800.84s)]
*  the belief of the world and the world's Christians, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3802.84s)]
*  not just Catholics. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3805.84s)]
*  Just 380 years later, in 1992, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3808.32s)]
*  Pope John Paul II apologized for the Galileo affair. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3811.32s)]
*  His successor, Benedict XVI, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3816.32s)]
*  has sought middle ground in the centuries-old skirmishes [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3819.32s)]
*  between the Church and science. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3822.32s)]
*  In a recent sermon, he said, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3824.32s)]
*  even the Big Bang theory of the creation of the universe [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3826.32s)]
*  is not in conflict with the idea of the universe. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3830.32s)]
*  The theory of the creation of the universe [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3834.8s)]
*  is not in conflict with faith [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3836.8s)]
*  because God's mind was behind it. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3838.8s)]
*  This is the tricky, the tricky part. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3841.8s)]
*  And backstage in the Pope's library, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3845.8s)]
*  science is brought to bear on crumbling books [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3848.8s)]
*  as restoration workers deal with water damage, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3851.8s)]
*  mold and the ravages of time. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3854.8s)]
*  It seems endless, this work. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3857.8s)]
*  Yes, obviously. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3859.8s)]
*  Angela Gaitan and the others go inch by inch, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3862.28s)]
*  patching and strengthening ancient pages, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3865.28s)]
*  scratching off paste put on by well-meaning restorers [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3868.28s)]
*  centuries ago. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3871.28s)]
*  Paste that's turning acid, eating away at the page. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3873.28s)]
*  Mario Tabertzi seldom reads what he's repairing. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3877.28s)]
*  It's too distracting, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3881.28s)]
*  especially if the writer happens to be Michelangelo. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3883.28s)]
*  When I work on the Michelangelo papers, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3887.28s)]
*  it was the same that work on Mickey Mouse paper. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3890.76s)]
*  Mickey Mouse, yeah? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3895.76s)]
*  A difficult job may take months or even years, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3898.76s)]
*  but consider the result. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3901.76s)]
*  1,000 years after us, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3903.76s)]
*  I hope that they can read the same thing [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3906.76s)]
*  that we are reading now. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3908.76s)]
*  The library's most valued documents [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3914.76s)]
*  go back almost 2,000 years, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3916.76s)]
*  nearly to the time of St. Peter, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3919.2400000000002s)]
*  the first pope whose tomb lies beneath the basilica [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3921.2400000000002s)]
*  that bears his name. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3924.2400000000002s)]
*  His letters to the faithful [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3928.2400000000002s)]
*  make up two books of the New Testament. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3930.2400000000002s)]
*  And here is a copy written in Greek on papyrus [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3932.2400000000002s)]
*  by one of Peter's disciples around the year 200, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3936.2400000000002s)]
*  a mere century or so after his death. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3940.2400000000002s)]
*  In the beginning, it was the word, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3944.2400000000002s)]
*  and the word was God. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3946.2400000000002s)]
*  And from the same period, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3948.72s)]
*  the Gospel of Luke and part of the Gospel of John, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3950.72s)]
*  also written on papyrus, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3953.72s)]
*  venerated by early Christians in Egypt, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3955.72s)]
*  preserved for centuries in a desert monastery. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3958.72s)]
*  The bread for today give us. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3962.72s)]
*  They contain the oldest known copy of the Lord's Prayer, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3965.72s)]
*  so fragile we were only allowed to see replicas. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3969.72s)]
*  That great treasure of papyrus, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3973.72s)]
*  I think is the most important treasure of Christianity. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3976.2s)]
*  With our tour nearly over, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3981.2s)]
*  it seemed as if the library's collection [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3983.2s)]
*  had come to life in the streets of the Eternal City. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3985.2s)]
*  The centurions and crusaders, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3989.2s)]
*  the centuries of faith and folly, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3991.2s)]
*  time present and time past. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3994.2s)]
*  Leaving the library, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3997.2s)]
*  we thought there's something, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=3999.2s)]
*  something almost magical to be immersed in this place, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=4001.2s)]
*  to breathe the air and touch the hand of history. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTDa4Jk4C0&t=4005.2s)]
