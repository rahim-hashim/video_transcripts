# World's Most Interesting Places: Vol. 8 | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [November 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0)
*  You're about to see a remarkable footnote to history, a film made more than a hundred [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=0.0s)]
*  years ago on Market Street, San Francisco's main thoroughfare. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=18.54s)]
*  In fascinating detail, it shows how people lived and traveled and dressed in what was [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=23.0s)]
*  then as now the Golden City of the American West. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=28.84s)]
*  The film is well known to historians, but who made it and why? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=33.64s)]
*  And most important, exactly when? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=38.24s)]
*  For a century, time like the fog that blankets San Francisco has shrouded the answers. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=41.28s)]
*  But now we know. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=48.0s)]
*  The film is a time traveler's glimpse of a joyous city on the brink of disaster. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=50.28s)]
*  Our trip into the past begins on a San Francisco streetcar built in 1895. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  It still comes out once in a while and carries passengers down the main street. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=70.76s)]
*  It looks just like a cable car because it was built by the people who built the cable [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  cars. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=78.16s)]
*  Our tour guide is Rick Labscher of the Market Street Railway, a nonprofit group that keeps [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=79.16s)]
*  the city's vintage trolleys rolling. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  This is the main artery of San Francisco and always has been. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=90.32s)]
*  Market Street is three miles long, 120 feet wide, the beating heart of the city since [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  the days of the gold rush. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  This is where the original film started, right here about 8th Street. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  Right here is where the past comes alive, thanks to a camera mounted on the front of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=107.68s)]
*  a cable car a century ago, catching glimpses of fashion, faces, and the helter-skelter [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  of city traffic, horses, trolley cars, and that new devil's own invention, the motorcar. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  You can see when people turn to look at the camera, it was really the shock of the new. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=126.84s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  Here comes this contraption down the street with these guys hand-cranking this camera [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=133.64s)]
*  furiously. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=138.2s)]
*  Others had made films of San Francisco starting in the 1890s, but this cameraman had the good [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=140.2s)]
*  sense to simply turn it on and leave it on. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=146.16s)]
*  When you saw that film, what did you make of the people, the newsboys, the cars, the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=150.2s)]
*  horses, everything all happening at once right here on the tracks? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=155.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you can see that people would circulate wildly and they're just kind of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=160.04s)]
*  wandering across the street. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=166.68s)]
*  You have these huge drays led by teamsters with four, sometimes eight horses hauling [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=168.24s)]
*  along. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=174.8s)]
*  And it seems, watching the film, that there were absolutely no traffic rules. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=175.8s)]
*  It seems like it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=182.16s)]
*  It's sort of, people, it was optional to stay to the right. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=183.16s)]
*  But, you know, it seemed to be honored in the breach. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=187.28s)]
*  People will tell you today that Market Street is still that way. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  Looking back a century from the same spot on the same street is an eerie sight. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=195.4s)]
*  Teddy Roosevelt was president then. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=201.04s)]
*  Life expectancy was 47 years for men, 50 for women, most of whom still couldn't vote. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=203.84s)]
*  And no one, man, woman or a child, went out without a hat. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  The last few blocks of Market Street today, banks and brokers. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=217.32s)]
*  It's Wall Street West. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=222.88s)]
*  A century ago, the wholesale district offering coffee, tea and spices. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=224.88s)]
*  A time when a decent salary was $400 a year. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  A time reborn on film. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=235.12s)]
*  It's left us an astonishing record, the likes of which we rarely see. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=238.84s)]
*  Film archivist and historian Rick Prelinger owns the clearest of the three surviving [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=245.04s)]
*  copies of the film. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=250.32s)]
*  This is over 100 years old, but the image quality is just absolutely excellent. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=251.72s)]
*  How fragile is this? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=256.68s)]
*  Extremely. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=258.88s)]
*  This is a digitally restored, high-definition copy seen here for the first time on television. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=260.96s)]
*  What is it that moves us so when we see something like this? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=267.92s)]
*  It's uncanny. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=272.12s)]
*  First off, to see something that's so old, almost an alternate universe really. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  I love when the little kid is in the carriage ahead of the streetcar and opens up that curtain [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=280.2s)]
*  and peeks out. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=286.88s)]
*  And then at the very, very end, the streetcar turns around and you have a glimpse of newsboys [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=288.76s)]
*  looking at the camera and waving just for a few frames. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=294.52s)]
*  It dazzles audiences. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=297.88s)]
*  People applaud this film. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=299.8s)]
*  It ends here, at the Ferry Building on San Francisco Bay. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=301.40000000000003s)]
*  The movie is a small gem about a much larger gem, this magnificent city on the hills. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=307.68s)]
*  But it's more even than that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=315.2s)]
*  It's a mystery. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=317.2s)]
*  A mystery quite literally ripped, as they say, from the headlines of the past. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=318.2s)]
*  It just seemed like it was an important enough film that something must have been written [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=327.44s)]
*  about it somewhere and why not try and figure it out? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=333.24s)]
*  I'm like that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=337.44s)]
*  David Keene is another movie historian, a man obsessed with unlocking the secrets of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=340.32s)]
*  the Market Street film, who spent days, weeks, months at the San Francisco Library scanning [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  old newspapers for clues. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=352.88s)]
*  Judging from the state of the construction on the various buildings along the way, the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=355.64000000000004s)]
*  Library of Congress had dated the film to September of 1905. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=360.44s)]
*  Screening it over and over, Keene wasn't so sure. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  There's some water between the tracks there, reflection. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=370.64000000000004s)]
*  The film showed puddles from a recent rain. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=374.88s)]
*  But the San Francisco newspapers from September 1905 showed no rain at all. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=378.48s)]
*  No air, zero precipitation. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=384.4s)]
*  More clues came from the surprising number of cars. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  There were only a few thousand of them in the whole country in those days, and it appears [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=391.47999999999996s)]
*  the drivers on Market Street were recruited to fill up the screen, circling around the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=396.23999999999995s)]
*  camera to make the city look more lively. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=401.44s)]
*  Was that one of the cars you, registrations you were able to identify? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=404.79999999999995s)]
*  J. Barry Anway, who was a chauffeur at this time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=408.96s)]
*  Keene checked old car licenses and registration records and discovered the chauffeur's car, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=413.76s)]
*  number 4867, was registered in January 1906. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=419.92s)]
*  Another one, number 5057, registered in February of 1906, suggesting the film was made some [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  time after that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=434.32s)]
*  Keene went back to the 1906 newspapers and found... [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=437.32s)]
*  Between around mid-March and going to the end of the month, there was quite a bit of rain. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=441.56s)]
*  Enough to account for the puddles, and to push the likely time the film was made into [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=448.68s)]
*  April 1906. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=453.92s)]
*  On April 18, 1906, as depicted in this painting, the great San Francisco earthquake struck. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=456.32s)]
*  It and the subsequent fire killed thousands. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=464.52s)]
*  Was there a eureka moment when you say, aha, it was not 1905, it was spring of 1906? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=468.88s)]
*  Well, certainly seeing the New York Clipper articles, that was the, I think, the defining [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=477.24s)]
*  moment. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=484.08s)]
*  Dramatic vaudeville circus. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=485.08s)]
*  The New York Clipper was a showbiz paper where actors, jugglers, songwriters, and movie makers [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=487.4s)]
*  advertised their wares, and where Keene found a series of ads from the Miles Brothers, filmmakers [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=493.8s)]
*  offering movie houses a travelogue called A Trip Through Market Street. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=500.84000000000003s)]
*  This ad from April 28, 1906, ten days after the quake. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=507.0s)]
*  We have the only pictures of any value ever made in San Francisco before the frightful [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=512.84s)]
*  catastrophe. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=518.92s)]
*  This strongly suggests the film was made just before the earthquake. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=520.24s)]
*  Yeah, well it actually spells it out exactly right here. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=525.0s)]
*  This film was made just one week before the complete destruction of every building shown [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  in the picture. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=533.7199999999999s)]
*  You research this summer confirmed that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=535.64s)]
*  Keene had stripped away the haze of history to show us the real story behind the trip [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=538.8s)]
*  through Market Street. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  San Francisco closing in on its rendezvous with catastrophe. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=546.4s)]
*  The odds are some of the people you see had just days to live. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=551.4s)]
*  When you look at that film, all you can think of is what was about to happen. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=566.4s)]
*  It takes on a power that is almost inconceivable because you can look at the buildings and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=572.56s)]

*  the story. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=638.8s)]
*  David Keene just produced so much wonderful information for us and we're astounded. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=640.1999999999999s)]
*  What is it about the trip down Market Street? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=646.16s)]
*  Why do you think people are so moved by it? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=649.8s)]

*  Yeah, it's just how vulnerable we are. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=661.12s)]
*  As for the man who figured it all out, he was armed only with a computer, the internet [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=664.2800000000001s)]
*  and an incurable curiosity. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=670.48s)]
*  Here's some film that we found up in the projection booth. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=673.36s)]
*  Keene understands well the strange power of images from the past. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=676.36s)]
*  In the California town of Niles, a throwback itself to a gentler age, Keene runs a theater [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=681.0s)]

*  That's the beauty of film. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=703.72s)]
*  It captures something that nobody today is seeing anymore. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=706.32s)]

*  part of the mainland. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=766.12s)]
*  The U.S. has walked a tightrope, respecting that one-China policy, but maintaining a special [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=768.36s)]

*  sorties with over a hundred warplanes, a barrage of ballistic missiles, and warships that [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=814.9200000000001s)]
*  encircled the island, delivering a loud and clear message that China could choke Taiwan [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=823.0799999999999s)]

*  It's a matter of when they will invade. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=838.24s)]
*  Admiral Li Ximin, who used to head Taiwan's armed forces, has been ringing alarm bells [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=841.52s)]
*  for years because as China's military has been growing, Taiwan's is shrinking. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=847.7199999999999s)]
*  The number of soldiers in uniform has been cut in half over the years. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=855.5999999999999s)]
*  The length of mandatory service had been reduced to just four months, and Admiral Li complains [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=860.5999999999999s)]
*  that the government has been buying the wrong weapons for years, tanks and jets from the [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=867.0s)]
*  United States instead of smaller, portable missiles. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=872.52s)]
*  What I gather you think the military needs are these stingers and javelins and drones, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=876.92s)]
*  exactly what they need in Ukraine. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=883.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's the truth. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=886.5999999999999s)]
*  And you're not getting them now because they're giving them to Ukraine. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=888.4399999999999s)]
*  We already ordered it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=893.0s)]
*  In my view, not enough. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=894.3199999999999s)]
*  However, we began to order that, but we have not yet received any. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=895.8s)]
*  Because other countries also have a kind of a similar requirement. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=901.28s)]
*  We are not on the top list, but we need now. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=905.72s)]
*  Did the Taiwanese military waste all those years buying those big weapons? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=910.72s)]
*  I believe so, you know, but we don't have time to waste anymore. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=917.84s)]
*  Taiwan receives little U.S. military aid, mostly buying its weapons. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=923.8000000000001s)]
*  But the manufacturers can't keep up with demand. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=929.64s)]
*  The Taiwanese have already purchased about $14 billion worth of weapons that they are [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=933.0s)]
*  just starting to receive. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=938.52s)]
*  We were surprised that few here seem to share the Admiral's sense of urgency. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=940.92s)]
*  Here in Taiwan, you'd never know that the Dragon to the North recently sent warships [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=946.48s)]
*  to surround the island. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=951.88s)]
*  People told us over and over, no big deal. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=954.04s)]
*  China's been doing versions of that for 70 years. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=957.64s)]
*  How much of the world thought an invasion was imminent? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=961.4s)]
*  Polls show that a majority of Taiwanese think that's unlikely anytime soon, if ever. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=964.92s)]
*  And that's reflected in what we saw in the capital, Taipei, where life goes on uninterrupted. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=972.04s)]
*  Morning traffic flows normally. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=979.4s)]
*  Shoppers do what they always do, during the day and at night. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=981.92s)]
*  We saw old people painting outdoors and teenagers practicing hip-hop routines, despite the threat [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=987.56s)]
*  from the North. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=995.68s)]

*  They tried all different kind of way. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1013.52s)]
*  Today I can give you very concrete figures. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1016.32s)]
*  There are 20 million cyber attacks per day. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1019.72s)]

*  Yes, every day. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1025.52s)]
*  Wang, who sits on Parliament's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee, took us to [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1026.76s)]
*  a high-security lab where engineers track those attacks. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1031.88s)]
*  This is Taiwan. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1036.72s)]
*  It's a small island, but we're proud of it. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1037.72s)]
*  The map shows the attacks from China in real time as they hit Taiwan. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1041.56s)]
*  And it's so close to China. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1047.56s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1049.56s)]
*  So is China hoping to defeat Taiwan without firing a single shot? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1051.12s)]
*  They dream like that. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1057.08s)]

*  But last year, Beijing suddenly banned Taiwan's grouper, devastating the fishermen. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1104.76s)]
*  Boxes and boxes of the fish piled up. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1111.56s)]
*  China also went after pineapples, crushing farmers like this young couple. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1115.0s)]

*  Can you imagine an orphanage that's a happy place? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1558.26s)]
*  We couldn't, but then we found one. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1563.7s)]
*  The kids don't arrive here smiling like orphans all over the world. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1566.24s)]
*  They've been abandoned. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1570.32s)]
*  They're hungry, sad, and desperate. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1571.32s)]
*  But after a few years, they're healthy, well-fed, and well, happy. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1574.28s)]
*  The orphanage is in Kenya, outside Nairobi. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1579.6s)]
*  And we might as well tell you now, it's an orphanage for elephants. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1582.84s)]
*  They've been orphaned because their parents, their mothers mainly, have died or more likely [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1587.46s)]
*  been killed in the bush. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1592.94s)]
*  Poachers kill large elephants, but they're ivory. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1594.98s)]
*  A young elephant can only survive a day or two without milk. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1597.94s)]
*  So the orphanage's first job is to find the orphans, fly them to the orphanage, and before [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1601.4s)]
*  anything else, feed them. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1606.74s)]
*  The principal of the orphanage, the principal, headmistress, head nurse, and CEO is Dame [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1610.68s)]
*  Daphne Sheldrick. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1616.38s)]
*  She founded the place, has been working with elephants for 50 years. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1617.88s)]
*  This is little Seguta. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1622.7s)]
*  This is the one that was in a coma when she arrived. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1623.8600000000001s)]
*  It was on a drip for 24 hours. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1626.66s)]
*  We never thought she'd be alive in the morning. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1630.3000000000002s)]
*  So she's our little miracle, this one. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1633.1000000000001s)]
*  But Daphne's problem is that she's caring for too many miracles. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1636.18s)]
*  Poachers are killing more and more elephants for their tusks, creating more and more orphans. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1640.42s)]
*  There's a record number of orphans here right now because, Daphne says, the sale of ivory [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1645.74s)]
*  has been legalized for the first time in 10 years. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1650.78s)]
*  A few African countries have been given the right to sell their ivory stockpiles, more [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1654.5s)]
*  than 100 tons of tusks, to China and Japan. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1659.46s)]
*  And conservationists point out this is yet another blow to Africa's elephants. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1663.46s)]
*  Do you see any correlation between the decision to auction off the ivory and the number of [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1668.6200000000001s)]
*  orphans? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1674.18s)]
*  We do. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1675.26s)]
*  Every time ivory is auctioned legally, there's a rise in poaching. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1676.26s)]
*  And we also see the correlation in the price that's paid to the poacher for illegal ivory. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1681.0600000000002s)]
*  Is the price going up? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1685.74s)]
*  It's gone from 300 shillings a kilo to 5,000. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1687.0600000000002s)]
*  That's about $1,000 a tusk. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1690.78s)]
*  And in Kenya, the number of elephants killed by poachers has increased by 45% this year [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1693.5s)]
*  alone. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1699.38s)]
*  A rather amazing rise, isn't it? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1700.38s)]
*  It is. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1702.26s)]
*  It's a scary, frightening rise. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1703.26s)]
*  Poachers were behind the death of this elephant. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1706.3s)]
*  Her trunk was caught in one of their snares, and she had no way of feeding herself or her [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1708.3799999999999s)]
*  six-week-old baby boy. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1713.66s)]
*  He just couldn't accept the fact that his mother was dead, so he continued trying to [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1716.06s)]
*  suckle. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1720.42s)]
*  Eventually, the keepers got him to drink their milk. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1721.42s)]
*  They called him Shimba, and he was in such bad shape that nobody thought he would survive. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1724.54s)]
*  But then he was brought to the orphanage, and things began going his way. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1731.02s)]
*  He's 27 months old now and is in very good shape, very muscular, very strong, and he's [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1735.1399999999999s)]
*  beginning to grow tusks. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1741.22s)]
*  He never stops eating. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1742.94s)]
*  In fact, that's the first love of every orphan here, eating. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1744.4199999999998s)]
*  The institution has a dining area, and that's not all. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1749.1s)]
*  As we found out when we first dropped by here three years ago, it has everything you'd want [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1753.06s)]
*  in an orphanage. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1757.46s)]
*  Dormitories. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1758.66s)]
*  Each orphan has a private room, a communal bath, and a playground. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1759.66s)]
*  The regimen at the orphanage is anything but Dickensian. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1765.1000000000001s)]
*  Unlike Oliver Twist, when one of these orphans asks for more, that's what he gets, more. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1769.06s)]
*  Ultimately, Daphne finds elephants more sympathetic than people. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1775.38s)]
*  What is the most extraordinary thing you have learned about elephants? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1780.18s)]
*  Their tremendous capacity for caring is, I think, perhaps the most amazing thing about [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1783.86s)]
*  them, even at a very, very young age. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1789.6599999999999s)]
*  Their sort of forgiveness, unselfishness. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1792.54s)]
*  So you know, I often say, as I think I've said before, they have all the best attributes [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1796.6599999999999s)]
*  of us humans and not very many of the bad. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1801.6599999999999s)]
*  Just about the best people you've ever met are the gentlemen who work here. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1805.6599999999999s)]
*  Keepers they're called, and they have extraordinary jobs. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1809.6599999999999s)]
*  There is one keeper per elephant. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1812.46s)]
*  He'll spend 24 hours a day with his charge, seven days a week. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1814.42s)]
*  The keeper feeds his elephant every three hours, day and night, just like mom would. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1818.02s)]
*  He keeps his elephant warm, not like mom would, but with a blanket. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1823.1000000000001s)]
*  And when it's sleep time, he beds down right next to his elephant. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1827.3400000000001s)]
*  If he leaves, if ever so briefly, the baby wakes up and broadcasts his displeasure. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1831.18s)]
*  The keepers are rotated now and then so that no elephant gets too terribly attached to [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1837.9s)]
*  any one of them. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1842.3000000000002s)]
*  At dawn, the elephants are taken from their dorms out to the bush. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1848.42s)]
*  They hang out for a while, play some games. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1851.5800000000002s)]
*  Soccer is a favorite. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1859.14s)]
*  And guess who decides when it's halftime. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1862.9s)]
*  The days are pretty much the same here, but on Fridays, the orphanage becomes a spa. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1868.74s)]
*  The keepers give the elephants a coconut oil massage. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1879.8200000000002s)]
*  We can't do exactly what the mother can do, but we do something close to that. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1884.8600000000001s)]
*  You're a surrogate mother. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1888.9s)]
*  Edwin Lucicci is the head of the keepers. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1890.66s)]
*  He is the chief elephant man. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1893.3000000000002s)]
*  This one here is Lwaleni. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1896.22s)]
*  Lwaleni is the oldest female we have, 16 months as well. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1898.22s)]
*  The tiny one here is Makena. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1904.0600000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1908.8600000000001s)]
*  Always want to be close with Lwaleni. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1910.5800000000002s)]
*  Yes, well, they always want to be close to each other and to you, don't they? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1912.66s)]
*  I'm afraid this interview with Edwin is getting rudely interrupted, but there's really not [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1919.02s)]
*  that much to do. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1924.66s)]
*  They may be little, they may be orphans, but trust me, they're not as little as they look. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1925.66s)]
*  In fact, I feel like I'm in an elephant sandwich. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1930.98s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1933.3s)]
*  Perhaps the problem was we had not been properly introduced. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1936.46s)]
*  There is a protocol to meeting an elephant. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1940.3400000000001s)]
*  He will offer up his trunk and he expects you to blow in it. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1942.98s)]
*  In the right way, he will remember your scent forever. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1946.86s)]
*  You will never be strangers again. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1950.2199999999998s)]
*  The little baby's been captured. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1953.2199999999998s)]
*  The orphanage gets distress calls from all over Kenya, from all over East Africa, that [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1955.26s)]
*  a baby elephant is on his own, often because his mother has been killed by a poacher. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1960.1399999999999s)]
*  It is then a matter of great urgency. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1965.82s)]
*  An orphaned elephant can only survive a few days without his mother. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1968.06s)]
*  The baby elephant is loaded onto a plane and flown back to Daphne Sheldrick's orphanage [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1972.94s)]
*  outside Nairobi, where he'll stay until he's strong enough to go back into the bush. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1978.14s)]
*  Dame Daphne has been running the orphanage for almost 30 years. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1986.1000000000001s)]
*  She was born and raised in Kenya and married David Sheldrick, Africa's leading crusader [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1990.3400000000001s)]
*  against poaching. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1996.02s)]
*  When he died in 1977, she founded the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=1997.66s)]
*  Daphne saw her mission as saving as many elephants as possible, but she has never permitted herself [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2003.7s)]
*  too much hope. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2009.46s)]
*  That's because she loses half the elephants that arrive here, some from pneumonia, some [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2010.46s)]
*  from trauma. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2015.8600000000001s)]
*  This elephant probably witnessed its mother's death and remembers everything. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2017.18s)]
*  It's the double-edged sword of having the memory of an elephant they never forget. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2022.1s)]
*  You know, he's still grieving for his elephant family. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2026.82s)]
*  He's in shock. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2030.9399999999998s)]
*  He's distressed. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2031.9399999999998s)]
*  Do you believe a baby elephant can die of grief? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2032.9399999999998s)]
*  Oh, yes, I know it can. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2035.62s)]
*  They're terribly, terribly fragile. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2038.2199999999998s)]
*  You've got to try and turn the psyche around, duplicating what that elephant would have [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2039.9399999999998s)]
*  had in an elephant family, touching them, talking to them gently. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2043.98s)]
*  In other words, love? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2048.42s)]
*  Tender loving care, TLC, and a lot of it. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2050.34s)]
*  Daphne and the keepers may run this place officially, but it's the elephants who are [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2053.42s)]
*  really in charge. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2058.1000000000004s)]
*  For example, when a new keeper is hired, he's on probation for three months. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2059.58s)]
*  Then, if the elephants like him, he's got a job. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2064.34s)]
*  If not, he's out. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2067.7000000000003s)]
*  What do you try to teach them? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2069.82s)]
*  Well, we have to teach them not to be naughty, not to push around with the others, to obey [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2071.02s)]
*  one another. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2076.94s)]
*  It's like you have to do to your children, your own children, to respect the others. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2078.66s)]
*  And the keepers teach the elephants how to be elephants. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2083.62s)]
*  There are wild elephant things these kids don't know how to do. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2086.66s)]
*  Mother wasn't around to teach them. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2090.2999999999997s)]
*  Things like covering themselves in dust to prevent sunburn. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2092.2599999999998s)]
*  The keepers do it with shovels until the elephants pick it up themselves. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2097.3799999999997s)]
*  The orphanage has an infirmary, and the doctor has a call to make. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2103.14s)]
*  One of the elephants is not doing well at all. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2107.26s)]
*  He's been on antibiotics for two days now, but he can barely breathe. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2110.3s)]
*  All this froth that's coming out of his trunk has got to be pulmonary edema. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2114.46s)]
*  His room looks like an intensive care unit. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2119.0200000000004s)]
*  The doctor, Daphne, and the keepers don't leave him for a minute. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2121.5s)]
*  They do everything they can, but it's not enough. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2127.42s)]
*  By dawn, he is dead. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2132.0200000000004s)]
*  How do you manage going through this all the time? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2138.26s)]
*  Well, you don't have much option, do you? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2142.78s)]
*  There's another one to look after, and then another one coming, and you know, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2144.7000000000003s)]
*  you just have to turn the page. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2149.98s)]
*  And you get attached after one... [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2155.0600000000004s)]
*  But I'm not very good at it. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2156.0200000000004s)]
*  And you're not going to get any better, are you? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2157.26s)]
*  No. Not after 50 years. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2158.86s)]
*  But then you go and you hang out with the, the orphans who are doing so well, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2161.82s)]
*  and it brings joy to your life. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2166.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2168.78s)]
*  It's actually a pretty lush life for these elephants here at the orphanage, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2170.38s)]
*  but it's not the life of a wild elephant. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2174.1400000000003s)]
*  It's not their destiny. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2176.2200000000003s)]
*  So like any good school, this place prepares its students to leave, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2177.7400000000002s)]
*  to get ready for life in the real world, to go back to the wild from whence they came. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2181.5800000000004s)]
*  This young lady left Daphne's orphanage to go live in the wild. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2188.0600000000004s)]
*  Her name is Impenzi, and a couple of years ago, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2191.82s)]
*  she became pregnant and decided to go off on her own to give birth, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2194.94s)]
*  without the protection of her extended family. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2199.02s)]
*  That was a mistake. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2202.46s)]
*  Before the sun could set, Impenzi and her baby were surrounded by a pride of 16 lions. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2204.62s)]
*  Keeper Joseph Sauny was called to the scene and captured the events on his still camera. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2211.58s)]
*  So Impenzi was standing there trying to scare off lions with their tongue. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2217.02s)]
*  But when they came, she tried to push them on this side, others come at the back. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2222.1400000000003s)]
*  Impenzi didn't have a chance. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2226.54s)]
*  How did you and the other keepers react? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2228.6200000000003s)]
*  And there was nothing they could do to save the baby. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2235.02s)]
*  It was a brutal lesson for Impenzi. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2237.7400000000002s)]
*  Nature has its own laws. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2240.46s)]
*  They're a long way from the sheltered world of the orphanage. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2242.7000000000003s)]
*  But this story has a happy ending. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2246.2200000000003s)]
*  Just days before we arrived, Impenzi gave birth to another little girl. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2248.86s)]
*  The keepers have all come out to cheer her on. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2254.2200000000003s)]
*  They named her Asante, which in Swahili means thank you. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2257.98s)]
*  Impenzi has learned her lesson. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2265.98s)]
*  This time she makes sure her bundle of joy is surrounded by other members of the family. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2268.1400000000003s)]
*  They help her up when she falls down and rescue her when she tumbles into a mud hole. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2273.58s)]
*  So for the moment, Asante will be safe, at least until she grows tusks. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2279.58s)]
*  Almost 20 years ago, we broadcast one of the most controversial stories in our 44 years on the air. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2285.1s)]
*  It was called Yes, but Is it Art? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2291.58s)]
*  I was accused of being a Philistine, someone lacking the aesthetic sensibility to appreciate [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2294.62s)]
*  the challenging nature of the world. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2300.14s)]
*  I was accused of being a Philistine, someone lacking the aesthetic sensibility to appreciate [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2302.38s)]
*  the challenging nature of the world. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2307.3399999999997s)]
*  I was accused of being a Philistine, someone lacking the aesthetic sensibility to appreciate [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2309.34s)]
*  the challenging nature of some contemporary art. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2313.98s)]
*  Art like Jeff Koons' Floating Basketballs, or another artist's Dripping Faucet. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2317.5s)]
*  In those 20 years, works that I questioned worth hundreds of thousands of dollars [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2323.42s)]
*  are now worth hundreds of millions. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2328.78s)]
*  In fact, contemporary art has become a global commodity, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2331.26s)]
*  just like oil or soybeans or pork bellies. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2335.34s)]
*  And there seems to be no shortage of people wanting to speculate in it, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2338.78s)]
*  and no shortage of billionaires willing to invest in it, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2343.26s)]
*  as a haven for their cash or love of art, or as a status symbol. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2346.94s)]
*  And to feed those beasts, there are now art fairs virtually every weekend around the globe. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2351.9s)]
*  And in contemporary art, none are more important than the one we went to in December. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2357.82s)]
*  To Miami Beach, once a mere escape from the winter blues. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2364.2200000000003s)]
*  Now one of the great contemporary art capitals of the world. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2369.5s)]
*  The region hosts at least 30 art fairs annually, most important of which is Art Basel. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2373.98s)]
*  In Miami, the executive jets arrive by the swarm, more even than flit in for the Super Bowl. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2380.86s)]
*  You can't tell the billionaires from the wannabes, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2388.14s)]
*  the gawkers from the gawkdad, the exhibitionists from the exhibitions. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2391.02s)]
*  They come to celebrate the bonanza that contemporary art has become. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2398.2999999999997s)]
*  The art market sizzles while the stock market fizzles. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2403.42s)]
*  The art market is a place where art is a place where art is a place where art is a place where [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2408.2999999999997s)]
*  the art market sizzles while the stock market fizzles. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2413.3399999999997s)]
*  This is where big disposable income comes to be disposed. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2417.98s)]
*  Inside you'll find an upscale flea market, a shopping mall where prices start at the thousands [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2425.58s)]
*  and end in the stratosphere. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2432.06s)]
*  There's very little sense of an aesthetic experience here, not the silence or even the [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2434.46s)]
*  suppressed hush of a gallery or museum. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2439.82s)]
*  What you hear or imagine you hear is the cacophony of cash. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2442.78s)]
*  This fair seems to be about art as stuff or stuff as art, just so much merchandise without [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2450.54s)]
*  a price tag in sight. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2457.82s)]
*  There are some timeless gems maintaining a quiet elegance, but they're shouted off the walls by [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2459.82s)]
*  the kitsch, the cute, the clumsy and the incomprehensible. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2465.82s)]
*  From oversized headwear [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2470.3s)]
*  to art as performance and of course video art, an artist in the agonizing throws of creation. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2475.82s)]
*  And then there's the question you've been dying to ask, how much is this stuff worth? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2484.94s)]
*  Rather, how much does it cost? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2491.1000000000004s)]
*  There's a price for you and there's a price for me and there's a price for somebody else. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2493.9s)]
*  Dennis Scholl and his wife Deborah are longtime collectors, familiar with the unwritten rules [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2497.82s)]
*  of the art bazaar. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2503.82s)]
*  It's really what a willing buyer will pay to a willing seller in the art world. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2505.5s)]
*  So when you go and look at a piece of art, you know, the price is what you negotiate. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2509.9s)]
*  There's no fixed price per se. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2514.62s)]
*  And prices move up and prices move down very quickly in the art world, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2517.6600000000003s)]
*  particularly with young artists. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2520.94s)]
*  And have you made some mistakes or have they all been pretty? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2522.46s)]
*  Well, we bought a thousand pieces of art in my life. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2525.34s)]
*  So we've made plenty, plenty of mistakes. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2528.94s)]
*  I mean, we have, yes. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2531.1s)]
*  There are, you know what you do? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2532.14s)]
*  Just bury them in the backyard and forget about them. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2533.5s)]
*  265 dealers are invited and they're willing to spend up to $150,000 [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2536.38s)]
*  for the privilege of showing their wares. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2543.34s)]
*  Am I, are we such Philistine slobs that we wonder about the value of some of [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2546.3s)]
*  this? Is this art that dazzles the eye or makes us think? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2551.74s)]
*  Do baby blue translucent bathroom fixtures prick the imagination? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2556.62s)]
*  Does that toilet seat raise our spirits or is it directing us to the men's room? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2561.74s)]
*  Or is this the biggest scam since Hans Christian Andersen trotted out the emperor's new clothes? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2567.66s)]
*  One thing's for sure. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2574.7799999999997s)]
*  It's no joke. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2576.2999999999997s)]
*  Look at this graph. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2578.14s)]
*  Contemporary art sales last year totaled about five and a half billion dollars. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2579.74s)]
*  And that only includes auction prices. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2585.2599999999998s)]
*  Private sales like these art fairs could be worth billions more. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2587.9s)]
*  Recession? What recession? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2592.54s)]
*  Good. Deal. Perfect. Cool. Great. A billion. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2595.18s)]
*  The real fundamental thing is we're here to sell a lot of art. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2598.7799999999997s)]
*  Tim Blum, a partner in Blum and Poe, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2603.2599999999998s)]
*  a Los Angeles gallery renowned for discovering the sharpest of cutting edge art. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2606.14s)]
*  Some of the art that you sell probably could be described as difficult. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2612.46s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. 100%. I mean, we kind of specialize in that. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2616.54s)]
*  You have to explain to a potential buyer why he or she might learn to love this. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2619.8199999999997s)]
*  Often you do. A lot of folks are just buying. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2629.1s)]
*  It's more like we need one of these things because everybody's getting one. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2631.5s)]
*  Status. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2635.1s)]
*  It's a status symbol. It's a speculative mechanism. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2635.98s)]
*  Do you sometimes have to grit your teeth even when you're making a sale? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2640.7s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, yeah, we're very good at that. We're from Hollywood. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2644.38s)]
*  We're in the acting game. Yeah. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2648.14s)]
*  It's theater. This is all theater. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2650.38s)]
*  And Blum knows all the A-list collectors. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2653.58s)]
*  There's people that are collecting art in a very beautiful, organic, autobiographical way [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2657.42s)]
*  where the art is a part of their lifeline. And then there's the pure speculators. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2662.94s)]
*  And then there's the people that just have so much money. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2669.1s)]
*  And the art is the next thing on the queue. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2671.42s)]
*  You're appealing to the 1% as opposed to the 99%, correct? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2675.98s)]
*  1% and or .0000001%. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2680.46s)]
*  We just bought this. Oh, you did? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2686.2200000000003s)]

*  He moved on to pick up photographs by Cindy Sherman. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2712.06s)]
*  He was one of her first collectors. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2715.7400000000002s)]

*  Let's walk in. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2761.98s)]
*  They, along with the dealer Barbara Gladstone, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2763.1s)]
*  went ape over this sculpture by Anish Kapoor. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2766.14s)]
*  And then you also don't know. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2770.62s)]
*  And you have no idea of death. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2772.46s)]
*  I mean, it's very strange. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2774.14s)]
*  He comes right out of... [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2775.3399999999997s)]
*  We moved on to an installation by Hege Yang, a Korean artist. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2776.22s)]
*  This tangle of extension cords, asking price, $33,000. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2780.54s)]
*  We already are very committed to this artist. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2786.2999999999997s)]
*  So I'm really excited to come and see new work by Hege. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2788.3799999999997s)]
*  She is a perfect example of a contemporary, peripatetic global artist. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2792.46s)]
*  I always find some sadness in your work. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2797.7400000000002s)]
*  Something's unstable. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2800.38s)]
*  Something's unfinished. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2801.5s)]
*  Something's like never complete. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2802.46s)]
*  It's always in the process. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2804.94s)]
*  And I think that's sort of how we live today. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2807.42s)]
*  ArtSpeak, the descriptive language of contemporary art, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2810.54s)]
*  could seem as opaque as spilled alphabet soup. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2814.38s)]
*  And the art fair gives you a very good context for this. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2818.38s)]
*  But a language fully understood by Jeffrey Deitch, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2821.82s)]
*  former dealer, now director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2825.1800000000003s)]
*  He could not resist reminding us of our report of 1993. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2831.1000000000004s)]
*  And who had the last laugh. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2836.2200000000003s)]
*  In the art world, we remember very well that famous program that you did 20 years ago, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2838.46s)]
*  where you was almost a send-up of the contemporary art market. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2845.1000000000004s)]
*  We had a little bit of fun with it. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2849.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2850.94s)]
*  I think in terms of market value, the time that we were talking, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2851.66s)]
*  Jeff Koons was very well sold at $250,000. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2857.1s)]
*  And as you know now, Jeff Koons' works have gone for $25 million and more. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2861.42s)]
*  And nearby, arguably the most powerful dealer in the art world, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2869.42s)]
*  the famously reticent Larry Gagosian, owner of 11 galleries around the world. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2873.98s)]
*  He reluctantly graced us with a few words of wisdom. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2880.38s)]
*  At least say hello. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2884.3s)]
*  Hey, Marlene. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2885.26s)]
*  This place has become one of the places that someone like yourself have to show at. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2891.02s)]
*  Yeah, for me, it's a place to sell art. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2898.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's a place to make money. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2900.06s)]
*  You know, the art fair has become a huge part of our business. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2901.5s)]
*  How has China and Russia changed the art market? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2904.14s)]
*  It's been a huge factor. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2907.5s)]
*  The wealth in Russia, the Middle East, Asia has changed dramatically. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2909.42s)]
*  Just how dramatically can be seen in this graph. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2915.82s)]
*  In orange is the contemporary art market's performance compared to the gray, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2919.02s)]
*  which is the S&P stock index. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2924.38s)]
*  Much of that dramatic rise is a result of those new billionaires from China and Russia [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2928.38s)]
*  parking their money in art. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2934.54s)]
*  You have to tell me a little more about this picture. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2937.34s)]
*  Maria Babakova, age 26, is interested in this dealer's Gerhard Richter, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2939.7400000000002s)]
*  a German artist who is the current rage. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2946.2200000000003s)]
*  It's got a lot of wall power. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2949.02s)]
*  She's a Russian oligarch's daughter who's spending a fortune on contemporary art. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2950.54s)]
*  And my painting, I'm selling it for $4.8 million. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2955.82s)]
*  So you're getting a bargain with me today. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2958.78s)]
*  That's a real bargain. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2960.38s)]
*  I think so. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2961.58s)]
*  Certainly a bargain if your daddy's a billionaire [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2962.62s)]
*  and you're playing in a market where the rule is there are no rules. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2965.74s)]
*  It's the Wild West. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2971.3399999999997s)]
*  This is not a normal retail business. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2973.02s)]
*  It's an unregulated, utterly bizarre place to conduct business. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2975.1s)]
*  The competition is great, yes? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2981.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2984.06s)]
*  It's literally a multi-billion dollar economy, the art world. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2984.7799999999997s)]
*  So the way the business is run and the competition between dealers, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2988.22s)]
*  between artists is often vicious. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2992.2999999999997s)]
*  This is where the art trade's carefully constructed mask [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=2996.7799999999997s)]
*  of Olympian high culture begins to crack. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3000.54s)]
*  And the underside of a booming cutthroat commodities market is revealed. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3004.22s)]
*  One without regulation or oversight, in which price fixing [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3009.58s)]
*  and control of supply to maintain demand is both legal and commonplace. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3014.06s)]
*  How does this boom keep sustaining itself against all odds? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3020.22s)]
*  It's inexplicable. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3025.18s)]
*  I mean, it really is almost unexplainable. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3026.46s)]
*  And we don't even, when we bring it up and want to start and begin to talk about it, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3028.94s)]
*  we sort of drop the subject because it almost feels like you should just let it keep rolling. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3032.7799999999997s)]
*  Because it's going against what's happening elsewhere in the economy. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3037.42s)]
*  Absolutely, 100%. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3040.22s)]
*  Meanwhile, the prices rise and the band plays on and all's well in this wonderful world. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3044.22s)]
*  If the music stops and the bubble bursts, no big deal. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3050.7s)]
*  The collectors are bubble proof. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3054.86s)]
*  It's only their mad money they're spending anyway. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3057.2599999999998s)]
*  They'll still have the pleasure of their art. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3060.38s)]
*  Easier to look at than pork bellies. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3063.1s)]
*  Or maybe not. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lpg1ybuU0&t=3066.7s)]
