# Boston Marathon bombing: The attack, the arrest, the recovery | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0)
*  A five-day battle in the war on terror leaves us with a lot of questions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=0.0s)]
*  What was the motive for the Marathon attack? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=18.8s)]
*  Where did the terrorists plan to strike next with their arsenal of bombs? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  And how did the manhunt stop them in only a little over 100 hours? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=25.4s)]
*  Tonight we have the inside story from one of the leaders of that hunt, Boston Police [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=30.64s)]
*  Commissioner Ed Davis. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  Last Monday afternoon, Davis was in the stands at the finish line. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=37.64s)]
*  All was going well, so he left to take a call. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=41.76s)]
*  One of the city's favorite celebrations was coming to an end. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  The Marathon is always on the day that marks the start of the American Revolution. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=49.12s)]
*  But suddenly, Ed Davis and a task force of more than 4,000 would find themselves defending [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=54.32s)]
*  Boston on Patriots Day. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  When you arrived, what did you see? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=67.48s)]
*  Something just blew up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=68.88s)]
*  I saw a bombing incident that I'd only seen in places overseas. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=72.44s)]
*  I saw our office of Michael Barrett from the Boston Police Department wade into an unbelievable [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=81.48s)]
*  scene of carnage and put the fire out on an individual that was still on fire and then [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=86.6s)]
*  grab belts off people and put tourniquets on the man's legs so he could save his life. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=92.8s)]
*  This is your city. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=98.58s)]
*  You're enormously proud of it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=100.84s)]
*  And these people had done this on Patriots Day. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=103.0s)]
*  It certainly made me resolve to find these people quickly and to hold them accountable. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=105.74s)]
*  You were going to get them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=110.38s)]
*  You made that promise to yourself? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=112.1s)]
*  I did. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  I made that promise to several other people too. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  Ed Davis' promise was to the three who were killed and more than 170 wounded. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=118.02s)]
*  The first calls he made were to Richard DeLaurier, head of the FBI's Boston office, and Colonel [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  Timothy Alban of the State Police. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=129.66s)]
*  The FBI took the lead and the Marathon became a sprint. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=132.3s)]
*  Very quickly we established a command post at the Weston Hotel in the ballroom and that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=137.10000000000002s)]
*  expanded from about a dozen people when I first walked in the door to a hundred people [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=142.94s)]
*  in the first hour. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  They found bomb parts right away. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=150.9s)]
*  Evidence cascaded in. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  It's a logistical nightmare. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=155.38s)]
*  We found very quickly that we needed a place to process this evidence. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=158.26000000000002s)]
*  So a warehouse was obtained very quickly. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=163.62s)]
*  Computers were brought in from the FBI and the State Police and the Boston Police and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=168.38s)]
*  set up to review video. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=172.28s)]
*  Among the thousands of faces, they wanted to isolate people who didn't seem surprised. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=175.26s)]
*  And particularly one of the FBI agents who was a technical expert did a tremendous job [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=182.06s)]
*  and really was the person that was able to get to the bottom of this very quickly. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  Look at these people running in terror but look deeper and see what the agents saw. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=192.58s)]
*  This kid seems unconcerned. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  Turned out he came with a backpack but he left without it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=201.5s)]
*  Just like the older man who seemed to be with him. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=205.84s)]
*  And when you saw the faces of those two men you thought what? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  I thought about the death of the eight-year-old boy, the Martin child, and how someone who [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  didn't appear to be particularly evil could do such an evil thing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=222.02s)]
*  They didn't appear all that evil to you in the video? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=227.44s)]
*  No, they looked like college kids. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=230.06s)]
*  19-year-old Jehar Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother Tamerlan were from a region of Russia [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  that's mostly Islamic. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  Their ancestors were from Chechnya where Islamic militants have fought a vicious civil war [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=240.78s)]
*  against Russian rule. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=245.94s)]
*  In 2002 the family fled as refugees to the United States. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=248.1s)]
*  I can't give you a specific moment when I first met him. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=253.7s)]
*  He just sort of appeared in my life. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=257.65999999999997s)]
*  Rose Schutzberg knew Jehar at Cambridge, Ringe and Latin, a top high school where Jehar did well. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=259.9s)]
*  You told us at one point that you had in high school a little bit of a crush on him. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=267.06s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=271.18s)]
*  How could you not? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=273.1s)]
*  What was it about him? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=274.1s)]
*  I think it was that he was equally smart but also humble and incredibly funny. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=276.58s)]
*  He was just an all-around wholesome and good person. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=286.85999999999996s)]
*  He fit right in. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=291.14s)]
*  In 2012 he became a citizen swearing the oath to protect the United States from enemies [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=292.46s)]
*  foreign and domestic. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=298.65999999999997s)]
*  Did he seem overtly religious to you in any way? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=300.74s)]
*  Not even a little bit. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=303.94s)]
*  These friends saw him two weeks ago. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=305.2s)]
*  He was a sophomore at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=308.0s)]
*  Ahmad Nasri and Basil Nasri tried without luck to get him to join the MSA, the Muslim [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  Student Association. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=318.68s)]
*  Did you see him at mosque? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=320.0s)]
*  You see him at prayers? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=321.32s)]
*  Nothing like that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=322.56s)]
*  No, no, unfortunately. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=323.56s)]
*  Unfortunately. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  I would have loved for him to come to the MSA a few times so we can maybe understand [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  his religion better. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=331.52s)]
*  Maybe that would have helped in what happened, I would say. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  What was he interested in? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=338.2s)]
*  Soccer. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=339.64s)]
*  Hars. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=340.64s)]
*  If someone a few days ago told me that one of my friends was responsible for the bombs, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=341.64s)]
*  bombing in Boston, I would have named off at least 90% of everyone that I know before [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=347.88s)]
*  I would have said Jahar. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=354.56s)]
*  Tamerlan Tsarnaev did not fit in easily. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=356.52s)]
*  A champion amateur boxer, he was disappointed that he couldn't try for the U.S. Olympic [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=359.64000000000004s)]
*  team because he wasn't a citizen. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=364.44s)]
*  He lived with his wife and child in this Cambridge house divided into three apartments. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=367.24s)]
*  Al Amman lives there too, and he says he and Tamerlan argued three months ago. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=372.36s)]
*  He was explaining how the Bible is a cheap copy of the Quran and how it's used for the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=378.5s)]
*  American government to as an excuse to invade other countries. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=386.96s)]
*  I remember he said that America is a colonial power trying to colonize the Middle East and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=391.79999999999995s)]
*  Africa. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  He also said that the most casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq are innocent bystanders gunned down [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=400.52s)]
*  by American soldiers. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=408.32s)]
*  Did he seem angry about all of this? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=410.44s)]
*  He seemed more passionate about it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=413.67999999999995s)]
*  Passionate about it? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  He strongly believed what he said. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=417.24s)]
*  There was tension between both of us, but it was more of a really involved discussion. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=419.56s)]
*  Strong beliefs was exactly what Russian intelligence told the FBI about Tamerlan. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=426.0s)]
*  Two years ago, the Russians asked the FBI to look into whether he was involved in militant [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=432.68s)]
*  Islam. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=437.88s)]
*  FBI agents interviewed Tamerlan and decided he wasn't a threat. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=438.88s)]
*  Still, his pending application for citizenship was held up because a background check turned [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  up that 2011 FBI investigation. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=449.92s)]
*  The FBI is now looking into why Tamerlan returned to Russia recently for about six months. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=453.24s)]
*  Last Thursday, when it released the tape, the FBI knew him only as subject number one, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=460.12s)]
*  with subject number two following in his footsteps. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=466.52s)]
*  It was only five or six hours after the videotape was released that events began to unfold rapidly, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=470.48s)]
*  and there was a great deal more violence. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=477.90000000000003s)]
*  It's possible that these individuals activated themselves once again because they saw the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=479.92s)]
*  pictures, because they knew that we would eventually find out who they are. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=485.42s)]
*  By 1015 Thursday night, Officer Sean Collier was ambushed and murdered in his cruiser. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  Then, gunmen hijacked a car which was spotted by a lone Watertown officer. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=496.28s)]
*  At that point, the vehicle stopped, and two suspects alighted from the area of the vehicle [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=502.04s)]
*  and opened fire on the officer. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=510.32s)]
*  Very quickly, another officer, Officer Richard Dunahue from the MBTA police, arrived at the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  scene and also engaged in the gun battle. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=521.88s)]
*  He was shot and grievously wounded. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=524.66s)]
*  The suspects began to lob devices at the police, and the first one was a huge explosion, and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=531.26s)]
*  then the follow-up explosions were smaller, but they were improvised hand grenades that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=537.14s)]
*  were being thrown at the officers. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=541.98s)]
*  The big explosion was a bomb like the ones at the Marathon. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=543.8199999999999s)]
*  Parts of it were embedded in the patrol cars. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=547.3s)]
*  The grenades were packed with steel pellets, just like the Marathon bombs. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=550.9399999999999s)]
*  The gun battle continued until one of the suspects ran out of ammunition, and one of [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=563.9399999999999s)]
*  the sergeants tackled him to the ground. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=569.62s)]
*  A police officer ran out and tackled him, these men who had armed themselves with so [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=572.38s)]
*  many explosives. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=579.26s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=580.26s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=581.26s)]
*  It probably would not be advised as a tactical move, but it shows the courage and commitment [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=582.26s)]
*  that officers have in attempting to get this thing under control. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=587.62s)]
*  He was going to put the guy down before he had a chance to reload and risk his own life [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=591.9s)]
*  to do it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=596.02s)]
*  He saw an opportunity and he took it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=597.02s)]
*  Tamerlan Tsarnaev was down, dying from multiple gunshot wounds. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=599.22s)]
*  The younger brother gets in the car, backs over his older brother, drives away. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=604.14s)]
*  What happened then? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=609.22s)]
*  The suspect that fled abandoned the vehicle four blocks, four or five blocks away and [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=610.56s)]
*  took off on foot. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=617.8199999999999s)]
*  We determined that a 20-block perimeter had to be set up. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=619.4s)]
*  And so began the lockdown of the city of Boston. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=622.3s)]
*  Keep the doors locked and not open the door unless there is a uniformed, identified law [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=624.74s)]
*  enforcement officer on the other side. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=629.34s)]
*  The Tsarnaev apartment was raided. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=631.98s)]
*  They found bombs inside and wondered what plans the brothers had for those. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=634.2s)]
*  The 20-block search lasted 15 hours and then Davis announced that they had lost the suspect. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=639.34s)]
*  There was extreme frustration and disappointment in the command post. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=646.76s)]
*  And it was not what, 30 minutes later? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=652.24s)]
*  It was probably close to 15 minutes later. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=655.4200000000001s)]
*  That a man called 911. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=657.66s)]
*  He went into his backyard where he has a boat with a cover over the top and he saw the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=659.42s)]
*  cover was torn. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=664.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=665.26s)]
*  He said he was dying for a cigarette. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=666.26s)]
*  He had to go outside to have a cigarette. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=667.26s)]
*  And he saw the blood on the boat. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=669.62s)]
*  And so he peered in after climbing the ladder. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=671.62s)]
*  And he told me that he saw a body in there with blood on it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=675.18s)]
*  We got movement. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=678.66s)]
*  He is moving. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=679.66s)]
*  We have movement in the boat. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=680.66s)]
*  A gunshot was heard and officers returned fire. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=682.5s)]
*  The auto was given to cease fire. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=686.9s)]
*  We then pulled the state police helicopter in which has a forward looking infrared device [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=690.3s)]
*  on its nose and it was able to come in and actually look through the plastic on the boat [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=696.74s)]
*  and see the suspect inside. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=702.38s)]
*  My thought when I first heard those 20 rounds was that he was already dead. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=704.66s)]
*  Neighbor George McMasters heard it all from his home nearby. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=708.68s)]
*  The thought that he had been killed just to me is one more tragedy because the last [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=712.78s)]
*  pictures I saw he was an older face and that is not the face I remember. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=719.62s)]
*  McMasters had once hired Johar as a 16-year-old lifeguard. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=724.9399999999999s)]
*  If Johar is the bomber, McMasters has a question. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=729.8199999999999s)]
*  How in the world did this happen? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=734.18s)]
*  How could he have changed so much in the year and a half that I had been absent? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=736.82s)]
*  Go from the young man that polite, well-spoken, friendly, engaging, typical American teenager [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=742.7800000000001s)]
*  to what I have to say is a monster. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=750.46s)]
*  His question is one of the mysteries. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=753.86s)]
*  Though his friends didn't see it, we know Johar was failing in college. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=756.1400000000001s)]
*  Something had changed. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=761.7800000000001s)]
*  An FBI negotiator talked him out of the boat. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=764.5s)]
*  He had been shot in the leg the night before. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=767.58s)]
*  Suspect is in custody. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=769.82s)]
*  Nobody is to come in the perimeter. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=770.82s)]
*  It's still a hot scene. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=771.82s)]
*  They treated him for a gunshot wound through the mouth that exited the back of his neck. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=774.14s)]
*  Whether that was a suicide attempt, Davis won't say. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=779.46s)]
*  Do you think he's going to pull through? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=783.54s)]
*  I wouldn't comment. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=785.18s)]
*  But the wounds are serious enough that there's a chance that he might not? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=786.18s)]
*  They're very serious wounds. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=789.02s)]
*  On Saturday at Fenway, the Red Sox honored the innocent people who were lost and wounded [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=793.38s)]
*  and the army of 4,000 who were part of the investigation. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=799.5s)]
*  In Boston, of course, this is a great honor. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=803.9s)]
*  The Red Sox are the second oldest sporting institution in the city after the Boston Marathon. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=806.46s)]
*  The two explosions that tore through the Boston Marathon nearly a year ago were like [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=818.9s)]
*  a starting gun on a second race against time. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=823.78s)]
*  Unknown terrorists were on the loose and they had more bombs. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=827.54s)]
*  Now, for the first time, you're going to hear the inside story from the federal investigators [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=831.38s)]
*  who ran the manhunt. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=836.9s)]
*  They led a task force of more than 1,000 federal agents, state police, and Boston cops. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=839.18s)]
*  Tonight, they will speak of the disturbing evidence that cracked the case and of a debate [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=845.34s)]
*  among the investigators that ultimately led to the dragnet's violent end. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=851.3000000000001s)]
*  The afternoon of April 15th, the FBI's man in charge of Boston got a text, two large [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=856.5s)]
*  explosions near the finish line. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=862.84s)]
*  For Special Agent Rick DeLaurier, the marathon became a sprint to catch the killers before [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=865.64s)]
*  they struck again. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=871.3000000000001s)]
*  I felt that week that I had the weight of the world on my shoulders and I'm sure I wasn't [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=873.74s)]
*  the only one. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=877.38s)]
*  Did you feel if there was a third bombing it would be on you? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=878.38s)]
*  That's everybody's fear. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=883.46s)]
*  It would be on me. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=884.46s)]
*  It would be on the Joint Terrorism Task Force. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=886.62s)]
*  But that wasn't what drove us. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=890.66s)]
*  What drove us is preventing more people from getting hurt. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=892.28s)]
*  264 were hurt already, three killed. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=895.1s)]
*  Years before, Rick DeLaurier had been counting the days to retirement, 26 years at the FBI. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=900.1s)]
*  Now, on Boylston Street, he took over the biggest investigation of his life. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=906.4200000000001s)]
*  It was a scene of devastation. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=911.86s)]
*  There was evidence everywhere. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=913.86s)]
*  And you said what to yourself in that moment? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=915.78s)]
*  I said we will find those responsible for these despicable crimes. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=917.98s)]
*  FBI Director Robert Mueller ordered every office in the world to back up DeLaurier. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=921.3000000000001s)]
*  DeLaurier's link to headquarters was Executive Assistant Director Stephanie Douglas. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=927.22s)]
*  We were very, very concerned about other bombs in Boston. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=932.18s)]
*  But we had to think beyond that. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  Were there other bombs in other cities? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=937.14s)]
*  Were U.S. interests even abroad at risk? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=939.42s)]
*  So we had to consider everything. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=942.8s)]
*  We could not eliminate anything. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=944.98s)]
*  First came the crime scene. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=947.14s)]
*  Twelve blocks of debris, abandoned backpacks and bomb parts blown to smithereens. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=948.9s)]
*  They set up a grid pattern. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=955.44s)]
*  Evidence could be on windowsills. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=957.08s)]
*  Evidence could be on roofs of buildings. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=958.72s)]
*  Evidence could be anywhere. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=960.96s)]
*  Are they going down the street with tweezers? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=961.96s)]
*  Sometimes, when they need to, they're doing that. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=964.0s)]
*  But yes, they're very carefully picking up everything they see. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=967.2s)]
*  They saw a battery pack for model cars and chunks of two pressure cookers. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=971.98s)]
*  The cookers concentrate the explosion for maximum force. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=977.4000000000001s)]
*  You decided to set up a warehouse near Logan Airport. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=980.96s)]
*  Everything swept from the street was processed in this 46,000 square foot warehouse. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=984.96s)]
*  Twice a day, a plane flew the items to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=990.52s)]
*  And you basically have almost like an assembly line of evidence. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=996.04s)]
*  So it gets tagged, it gets recorded as evidence so that you're preserving that chain of custody. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=999.94s)]
*  But it also, for all the different parts and components, that would later go to recreating [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1006.9200000000001s)]
*  the devices themselves. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1011.72s)]
*  The bombs. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1013.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1014.52s)]
*  Recreating the bombs. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1015.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1016.52s)]
*  From the pieces that you found. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1017.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1018.52s)]
*  Successful as that was, it turned out the evidence that would solve the case had been [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1019.52s)]
*  collected before the first bomb exploded that Monday. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1024.8799999999999s)]
*  The FBI could travel back in time through the lenses of dozens of security cameras up [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1029.36s)]
*  and down Boylston. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1035.24s)]
*  Almost 13,000 different videos were obtained. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1037.12s)]
*  120,000, actually more than 120,000 still photographs. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1040.36s)]
*  At the FBI lab in Virginia, 120 analysts were searching video feeds from Boston. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1045.6399999999999s)]
*  What are you looking for? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1052.6399999999999s)]
*  Somebody who just doesn't look similar to others in a crowd who would be watching a [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1053.9199999999998s)]
*  race. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1058.4799999999998s)]
*  Was there a eureka moment in terms of the video? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1059.56s)]
*  At some point somebody said, hey boss, have a look at this. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1063.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes, there was. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1066.24s)]
*  It was, I believe, a Wednesday morning and we watched that video hundreds and hundreds [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1067.24s)]
*  of times. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1071.84s)]
*  You can see an individual, a tall man wearing a white ball cap, walk into the frame. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1072.84s)]
*  He has a backpack slung over one of his shoulders. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1082.24s)]
*  He puts the backpack down very nonchalantly. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1085.88s)]
*  He joins the crowd. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1088.46s)]
*  You clearly see everybody look very, very definitely to the left, like they've heard [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1090.1200000000001s)]
*  something. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1095.36s)]
*  So you know that first blast has gone off. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1096.4799999999998s)]
*  He does not do that. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1099.4799999999998s)]
*  He does not do what everybody else in that video does. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1100.74s)]
*  He does not turn to his left. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1103.6799999999998s)]
*  He instead just stands there for a second or two and walks very deliberately back the [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1105.52s)]
*  same direction that he came in. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1112.9599999999998s)]
*  The eureka video hasn't been seen by the public. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1114.4799999999998s)]
*  It is being kept for the trial. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1117.6799999999998s)]
*  But this still photo shows much the same view of the suspect and the people who would be [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1120.04s)]
*  torn apart by the blast. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1125.6s)]
*  Let me ask you to describe what you see in that picture. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1127.48s)]
*  I see the subject, the individual who has been charged in investigation, and I see people [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1136.32s)]
*  who were grievously injured in that blast, and I see individuals who died in that blast. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1140.88s)]
*  The people along the fence line there. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1146.4s)]
*  Several of them, yes. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1148.92s)]
*  A very, very emotional time. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1149.92s)]
*  I want to look at that to know what happened a few moments afterwards. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1151.8000000000002s)]
*  I believe I see his backpack on the ground, and then I see one of the people that was [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1155.44s)]
*  killed as a result of that bomb. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1162.88s)]
*  Do you know their name? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1164.68s)]
*  This is Martin Richard. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1167.64s)]
*  Martin Richard was eight years old. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1169.76s)]
*  His seven-year-old sister Jane lost a leg. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1172.2s)]
*  Their father Bill suffered hearing damage from the bomb in the backpack laid at their feet. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1175.44s)]
*  In the video, the backpack explodes 20 seconds after the man in the white hat walks away. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1181.84s)]
*  Stephanie Douglas saw it in the FBI's Washington Command Center. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1187.84s)]
*  Nobody I've talked to can quite find the words. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1191.68s)]
*  It's a horrible video to watch. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1198.56s)]
*  After the bomb goes off, obviously, it's a very smoky situation. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1203.76s)]
*  There's a lot of smoke, and the smoke clears. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1208.64s)]
*  What you saw is a very happy scene of people watching that marathon. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1212.6000000000001s)]
*  It's no longer that. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1218.72s)]
*  Even after seeing something so horrible, I remember this survivor who, unfortunately, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1220.4s)]
*  his clothes were on fire. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1228.4s)]
*  I just remember this police officer getting down on his hands and knees and putting out [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1229.8s)]
*  the flames on this person with his bare hands. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1235.8s)]
*  I just thought to myself, what an incredible contrast of events. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1240.32s)]
*  Something so horrific, and then we have this person with no thought of his own comfort [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1247.0s)]
*  or consequences to himself, Russian, and actually do something like that. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1255.1200000000001s)]
*  That was so brave. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1259.92s)]
*  I still remember that very clearly. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1261.3600000000001s)]
*  Only two days had passed. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1264.56s)]
*  Now they were looking for every image of the suspect they called White Hat. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1266.0s)]
*  Massachusetts State Police analysts found him with a man in a black hat. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1270.1200000000001s)]
*  Which turned out to be his older brother. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1274.8400000000001s)]
*  Now you have the Sarnayev brothers. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1277.24s)]
*  But you don't know that. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1279.2s)]
*  No, I don't know that. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1280.2s)]
*  I don't know who they are. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1281.2s)]
*  Then suddenly that Wednesday confusion reigned when cable news channels erroneously reported [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1282.8400000000001s)]
*  that a suspect had been arrested and was headed to the courthouse. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1289.0s)]
*  The error caused pandemonium, according to U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, who's leading [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1293.6s)]
*  the prosecution. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1298.24s)]
*  And I remember turning to my colleague and saying, to my press person saying, do we have [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1299.8s)]
*  someone in custody? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1305.52s)]
*  And I turned to Rick Deloria, do we have someone in custody? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1306.52s)]
*  And they were like, no, we don't have anyone in custody. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1309.6399999999999s)]
*  I think that kind of misinformation makes it appear as if government isn't in control. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1312.36s)]
*  The investigation is sort of confusing. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1316.8799999999999s)]
*  And so it can be very, very harmful. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1320.1999999999998s)]
*  More harm was done the next morning when the New York Post added to the erroneous reporting [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1322.44s)]
*  by putting a man with a white hat on its front page. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1327.6000000000001s)]
*  Only problem was, it wasn't the right man in the white hat. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1331.28s)]
*  That generated tremendous risk and harm. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1334.4s)]
*  It gives people false sense of security thinking, oh, they've identified these suspects. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1337.24s)]
*  When it turns out that it's wrong individuals, it puts those individuals at tremendous risk. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1342.26s)]
*  The risk to the innocent lent urgency to the debate over whether to release the real [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1348.14s)]
*  pictures. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1353.2800000000002s)]
*  Why wouldn't you release the pictures to the public? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1354.9s)]
*  Isn't that the fastest way to find the perpetrators? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1357.8600000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1361.0200000000002s)]
*  But it's also, it gives them every opportunity to escape. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1363.66s)]
*  Remember, we do not have the identities of anybody. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1367.18s)]
*  So your concern was that if you put the pictures out there to the public, they'd know they'd [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1370.5s)]
*  been had and they'd run. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1376.6200000000001s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1378.5s)]
*  The countervailing argument is you had individuals, we had photographic evidence of individuals [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1379.8600000000001s)]
*  who we strongly believed were responsible for the bombings and we needed to identify [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1385.3000000000002s)]
*  them as quickly as possible. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1390.14s)]
*  So Thursday, Rick Deloria walked out in time for the evening news. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1391.9s)]
*  These images should be the only ones, I emphasize the only ones, that the public should view [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1397.4s)]
*  to assist us. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1401.7800000000002s)]
*  The pictures set events in motion that Deloria didn't predict, in fact didn't recognize, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1403.68s)]
*  even after they started. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1409.5600000000002s)]
*  My wife was watching the news that evening. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1410.96s)]
*  An officer has been shot. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1412.8s)]
*  And there was a story about an MIT police officer who was subsequently identified as [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1415.8400000000001s)]
*  Officer Sean Collier, who had been murdered that evening right on campus. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1419.64s)]
*  My wife looked at me and she said, I bet those are your guys and they're on the run right [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1424.76s)]
*  now and I bet they've murdered this police officer. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1429.76s)]
*  And I didn't believe her. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1432.56s)]
*  I said, oh no, I don't think so. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1433.56s)]
*  And I went to bed. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1435.24s)]
*  Your wife had cracked the case and you went to bed? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1436.36s)]
*  I did not believe that she had cracked the case at the time. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1439.32s)]
*  I went to bed. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1441.76s)]
*  I went to bed probably around 10 o'clock and this is probably a sad commentary in my life, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1442.76s)]
*  but my blackberry was on the pillow next to me. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1449.8s)]
*  And somewhere around 1230 quarter to one in the morning, I received a phone call from [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1452.04s)]
*  one of my assistant special agents in charge, Jeff Sillett. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1456.9s)]
*  My phone rang about a little after one in the morning. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1460.3s)]
*  I woke her out of a sound sleep and I said, an MIT police officer has been murdered earlier [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1464.94s)]
*  this evening by individuals we believe to be responsible for the bombing and they are [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1469.58s)]
*  on the streets of Watertown right now engaged in a shootout with the Watertown Police Department. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1474.82s)]
*  It was combat. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1488.14s)]
*  Two suspects threw pipe bombs and a pressure cooker bomb at the police. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1489.54s)]
*  An officer was gravely wounded. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1493.62s)]
*  Those who argued that releasing the pictures would cause the suspects to run were right. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1496.22s)]
*  Was putting the pictures out the right call? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1502.22s)]
*  Yes, I think at the end of the day, we really had no choice. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1504.18s)]
*  Believe me, the death of Sean Collier is not lost on the FBI. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1507.6399999999999s)]
*  We consider it an incredibly tragic event. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1510.78s)]
*  But I think at the end of the day, given the facts as we knew them at the time, we made [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1514.46s)]
*  the best decision. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1519.14s)]
*  How do you feel about that decision now? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1521.1000000000001s)]
*  I stand by that decision, Scott. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1523.18s)]
*  Nobody could have reasonably foreseen that a police officer would be murdered. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1525.14s)]
*  What could reasonably be foreseen is that these individuals could have had more bombs, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1530.5s)]
*  could have set those bombs off and caused carnage similar or even greater to what they [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1536.5s)]
*  caused on April 15th. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1542.8200000000002s)]
*  One suspect was killed, the other vanished. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1544.3s)]
*  In minutes, the FBI matched the dead man's fingerprints to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, an immigrant [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1549.7s)]
*  from Kyrgyzstan. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1555.98s)]
*  Other records showed he had a brother. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1557.74s)]
*  Yeah, and I remember that so clearly. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1559.98s)]
*  Somebody walking in with a manila folder and said, okay, here's his brother, and they opened [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1561.94s)]
*  it, and it's this picture, and I go, that's him. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1566.02s)]
*  That's Whitehat. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1569.98s)]
*  That's who we should be looking for. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1570.98s)]
*  Friday, the governor ordered a lockdown of Boston, but a house-to-house search turned [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1573.1399999999999s)]
*  up nothing. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1578.2199999999998s)]
*  Everybody's exhausted and deflated. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1579.2199999999998s)]
*  It's a very sad day for Boston, another sad day for Boston. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1583.62s)]
*  But then, a man noticed someone in a boat in his backyard. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1587.1599999999999s)]
*  Jokhar Tsarnaev was wounded but alive. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1592.26s)]
*  What did you think as he went into court to be arraigned? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1596.1399999999999s)]
*  He had a smug grin on his face much of the time in the courtroom. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1599.0s)]
*  He would glance over his right shoulder back to his relatives and smile and smirk at them, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1603.08s)]
*  and I found that absolutely galling, and I found it reprehensible. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1608.28s)]
*  The attorney general has decided to seek the death penalty in this case. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1613.14s)]
*  Yes, he has, and I support that decision. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1616.76s)]
*  Jokhar Tsarnaev has pled not guilty. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1622.48s)]
*  His defense team declined to speak with us. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1625.12s)]
*  U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz is preparing for a November trial. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1627.6s)]
*  Eight days from now, a million people are expected to line the streets of Boston to [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1636.3999999999999s)]
*  watch 36,000 runners compete in the world's oldest and most prestigious marathon. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1640.52s)]
*  The memory of the bombings near the finish line of last year's Boston Marathon is still [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1646.32s)]
*  fresh, and next week, the race promises to be unlike any other in its 117-year history. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1650.52s)]
*  A chance for the city to come together and reclaim a beloved tradition that was torn [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1657.28s)]
*  apart by an act of terror. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1662.3600000000001s)]
*  There hasn't been an American winner, male or female, of the Boston Marathon in almost [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1664.72s)]
*  30 years. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1669.52s)]
*  Kenyan and Ethiopian runners now dominate the sport. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1670.8s)]
*  But this year, an American woman named Shalane Flanagan has a very real chance of winning [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1674.44s)]
*  the 26-mile race. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1679.6000000000001s)]
*  She's only 5'4 and 102 pounds, but don't be fooled. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1681.8400000000001s)]
*  She's been called a ponytailed assassin in knee socks. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1686.32s)]
*  She also happens to have grown up in Boston, which makes her next week's hometown favorite. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1689.9199999999998s)]
*  Maybe it's just a Bostonian thing, but I was really genuinely just pissed off that someone [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1696.08s)]
*  would ruin such a celebratory day and a historical moment with that kind of action. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1701.08s)]
*  You were angry. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1709.08s)]
*  I was angry. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1710.08s)]
*  I was really pissed off that someone would do this. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1711.08s)]
*  It was a personal attack to my city. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1715.04s)]
*  Shalane Flanagan has been running in her city since she was a teenager. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1720.32s)]
*  She grew up in Marblehead, a nearby suburb. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1724.6399999999999s)]
*  Although she lives in Portland, Oregon now, she frequently returns to Boston to train [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1727.32s)]
*  along the marathon route. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1732.04s)]
*  It's my ultimate dream and goal to win the Boston Marathon. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1734.36s)]
*  I am all in with this training. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1737.24s)]
*  I have been out on the course training on it multiple times this fall, and I know almost [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1740.04s)]
*  every divot and bump in the road. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1745.98s)]
*  The Boston Marathon has been a part of Shalane Flanagan's life since she was a child. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1747.94s)]
*  Both her parents were marathon runners. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1753.0s)]
*  Her father ran 11 minutes off world record pace at the Boston Marathon in 1980. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1755.24s)]
*  Her mother set a women's world marathon record in 1971. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1760.04s)]
*  I thought everyone's parents ran. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1764.0s)]
*  I thought everyone got up and went to the Sunday long run. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1766.32s)]
*  You thought everybody's parents did that? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1771.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I thought it was like Church of Sunday long run. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1772.1599999999999s)]
*  Church of Sunday long run. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1773.84s)]
*  That's what my dad would call it. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1774.84s)]
*  Long before she ever thought of running the Boston Marathon, Shalane used to stand near [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1777.12s)]
*  the finish line of the race to cheer her father on. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1781.1599999999999s)]
*  I watched from Hereford all the way down to the finish, and that's exactly the two areas [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1784.8s)]
*  where the bombs went off. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1789.0s)]
*  It was a surreal moment to think of. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1791.3999999999999s)]
*  I was a little kid watching my dad run right there. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1793.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, that easily could have been me or my sister. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1798.1599999999999s)]
*  When the bombs exploded last year, three people were killed. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1800.9199999999998s)]
*  264 others were injured. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1806.08s)]
*  The youngest victim was 8-year-old Martin Richard. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1808.48s)]
*  To see the young bodies lying there on Boylston Street, it's something that I'll never get [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1811.72s)]
*  out of my mind. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1815.8799999999999s)]
*  William Evans is the new Boston Police Commissioner. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1817.48s)]
*  He's also a competitive runner. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1820.32s)]
*  Last year's marathon was the 18th he'd run in Boston. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1822.4399999999998s)]
*  To have just come down that street an hour earlier with such excitement, such joy, and [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1825.6799999999998s)]
*  then to return again, I just didn't believe that that could happen on Boylston Street [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1832.48s)]
*  in the city of Boston. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1838.84s)]
*  Commissioner Evans wanted to run again this year, but decided he should stay in the command [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1840.6s)]
*  post to oversee security. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1844.36s)]
*  You're going to see 36,000 people on that course with the same principle. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1846.8s)]
*  Let's prove that we won't be intimidated by what happened back in April. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1852.0s)]
*  The race this year for a great many people will be about that. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1856.32s)]
*  It will be seen as a response to terror, as a statement of resilience. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1859.32s)]
*  Tom Grillick is the executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, which has [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1864.84s)]
*  organized the marathon throughout its long history. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1868.8s)]
*  The event will go forward as what it has always been, both an athletic competition focused [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1872.28s)]
*  on excellence and a celebration around here of a great event in our community. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1878.16s)]
*  This year he believes more spectators than ever will be on the streets cheering on the [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1885.58s)]
*  runners. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1889.68s)]
*  They want to take part. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1890.68s)]
*  They want to take part. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1891.92s)]
*  If you're out there as a spectator and somebody comes along and their t-shirt says Carly on [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1893.08s)]
*  a thousand people along the way will say, go Carly. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1899.88s)]
*  Everybody will have a good time. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1904.68s)]
*  Carly will suddenly have thousands of new friends. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1906.36s)]
*  Carly will look wicked happy. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1909.24s)]
*  Most runners in next week's marathon will just be happy to finish or reach a personal [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1912.2s)]
*  best. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1916.1200000000001s)]
*  But for Shalane Flanagan and the other top runners, the goal is winning. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1917.1200000000001s)]
*  The race is as much about strategy and psychology as it is physical conditioning. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1921.2s)]
*  Obviously marathons are painful, but for you it's about being able to deal with pain yourself [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1926.3999999999999s)]
*  and also inflict pain on others. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1932.8799999999999s)]
*  That's part of strategy. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1935.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1937.32s)]
*  When I start to feel fairly uncomfortable, it's all about embracing it and realizing [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1939.04s)]
*  it's inevitable. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1943.58s)]
*  Embracing. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1944.58s)]
*  Embracing it, yes. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1945.58s)]
*  So if I'm uncomfortable, I usually know my competitors are uncomfortable. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1946.6799999999998s)]
*  If they're straggling behind, that's kind of the time when I say I'm going to put the [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1950.0s)]
*  I can tell that they're either struggling mentally or physically. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1953.76s)]
*  So I'm going to just push it and just see if I can break them. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1956.88s)]
*  This is going to sound like an odd question, but do you like inflicting pain on your opponents? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1959.88s)]
*  I think everyone who's got a competitive bone in their body, to a certain degree, enjoy [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1964.92s)]
*  seeing a little bit some of the having their competition fall apart. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1970.76s)]
*  When Shalane started running in high school, there wasn't much strategy to her racing. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1977.8600000000001s)]
*  I would run so hard that I would literally make myself collapse. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1982.72s)]
*  I've heard you refer to it as kamikaze racing. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1985.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's not... [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1988.1200000000001s)]
*  Kamikazes don't end up very well. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1992.2s)]
*  I know. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1993.2s)]
*  But sometimes it can be brilliant. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1994.2s)]
*  Shalane was a champion cross-country runner in college and won a bronze medal in the [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=1996.88s)]
*  10,000-meter race at the Beijing Olympics. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2000.6000000000001s)]
*  But to compete in the marathon, she needed to learn a whole new way to run. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2002.8000000000002s)]
*  In 2009, at the age of 28, Shalane moved to Portland, Oregon and began working with coach [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2008.56s)]
*  Jerry Schumacher. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2013.64s)]
*  So we're going to do two loops, which is a little over 24 miles. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2014.64s)]
*  I'm prepping her to learn how to run 26 miles without blowing yourself up. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2018.36s)]
*  Which she had never done before. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2022.88s)]
*  Which, yeah, because she likes to go out and she likes to suffer. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2023.88s)]
*  In a marathon, if you're suffering at mile three, you're probably not going to finish. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2026.88s)]
*  All right, good. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2031.88s)]
*  Running is Shalane's full-time job. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2033.92s)]
*  She's sponsored by Nike, which allows her to focus solely on training for the Boston [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2036.08s)]
*  Marathon. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2040.2s)]
*  She often runs twice a day, up to 120 miles a week. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2042.6s)]
*  In addition to lifting weights, she has to rigorously monitor everything she eats. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2046.3999999999999s)]
*  Food is fuel, but she doesn't want to gain any extra weight she'll have to carry in the [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2052.32s)]
*  marathon. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2056.88s)]
*  Watching Shalane and other top marathoners compete, it's easy to forget just how fast [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2059.6s)]
*  and how far they're running. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2064.44s)]
*  Last year's female winner of the Boston Marathon, Kenyan Rita Jeftu, closed her final mile at [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2066.44s)]
*  a pace of four minutes and 50 seconds. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2071.8s)]
*  To finish a marathon running at four minutes and 50 seconds per mile, that's incredible. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2075.04s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2080.44s)]
*  After 25 miles of running, you have to be ready, even if it takes just that last mile, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2081.44s)]
*  you know, to do whatever, you got to do whatever it takes to get into that finish line. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2085.6800000000003s)]
*  To get a sense of just how fast Shalane runs during a marathon, we decided to try to keep [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2089.48s)]
*  up with her on a racetrack at Nike headquarters where she trains. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2094.24s)]
*  This is like a real race? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2098.12s)]
*  This is a real race. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2099.12s)]
*  This is a real race. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2100.12s)]
*  Shalane would run a quarter mile at her marathon race pace, and I would run as fast as I could [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2101.12s)]
*  trying to stay with her. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2105.8399999999997s)]
*  So you're going to go for your marathon pace? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2107.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2109.68s)]
*  And I'm going to... [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2110.68s)]
*  We'll see if you like that pace or not. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2111.68s)]
*  Jerry started us off. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2113.3599999999997s)]
*  Ready, set, go! [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2115.2799999999997s)]
*  I jumped out front at first, but within a few seconds, Shalane, with her even pace and easy [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2118.2s)]
*  flowing stride, blew right past me, laughing all the way. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2123.16s)]
*  She completed the quarter mile in about 79 seconds. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2130.7599999999998s)]
*  Almost there! [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2134.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2135.8399999999997s)]
*  Keep in mind that to complete a marathon, you'd have to run that distance 104 more times. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2139.48s)]
*  Did you feel me suffering out there? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2144.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2145.8799999999997s)]
*  Did you hear those giggles? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2146.8799999999997s)]
*  That was pure joy. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2147.8799999999997s)]
*  You were giggling, yes. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2148.8799999999997s)]
*  Shalane's first marathon was in 2010 in New York City. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2150.28s)]
*  Remarkably, she came in second behind Kenyon Edna Kipligot. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2153.7200000000003s)]
*  And it's Shalane Flanagan. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2157.48s)]
*  Completing the 26.2 miles in two hours and 28 minutes. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2159.52s)]
*  It was the best finish by an American woman in New York in 20 years. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2163.6s)]
*  What did that tell you? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2168.6400000000003s)]
*  She can run the 26 miles. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2169.76s)]
*  She can do the training for it. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2171.2200000000003s)]
*  And in the right kind of race, she's going to be definitely dangerous. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2173.08s)]
*  This year, Shalane ran the Boston Marathon for the first time. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2176.88s)]
*  Early in the race, she and the other top women were running six minute miles. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2180.2400000000002s)]
*  A relatively slow pace. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2183.6800000000003s)]
*  When Kenya's Rita Jepto finally picked up the pace in the last few miles, Shalane's [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2185.52s)]
*  legs couldn't keep up. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2190.2000000000003s)]
*  Boston has this really fun way of trashing your quads. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2193.08s)]
*  As much as you tell your legs to respond and to pop off the ground, and as much as you [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2196.84s)]
*  want it spiritually and mentally, if your legs don't have it, they don't have it. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2201.6400000000003s)]
*  You can't, there's nothing you can do. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2206.68s)]
*  Like I try to talk to them, like legs, you have to keep moving. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2208.2s)]
*  You have to turn over. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2211.24s)]
*  You need to be coming and giving me more energy. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2212.24s)]
*  But if it's not there, it's not there. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2214.8399999999997s)]
*  It's not much you can do. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2216.48s)]
*  You're actually talking to your legs. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2217.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh yeah, I have talks with them. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2219.0s)]
*  Yeah, I look at my quads and I'm like, come on, you can do this. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2220.56s)]
*  And so, I mean, no one sees that. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2223.2s)]
*  Do they respond? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2225.48s)]
*  No, they're usually like, hey, screw you. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2226.48s)]
*  You know, we've been running for a long time. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2228.3599999999997s)]
*  Shalane finished fourth and after the bombings was the first runner to sign up again to compete [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2230.68s)]
*  this year. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2235.52s)]
*  For the past 12 months, she's been focused on this one race, memorizing the marathon [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2238.52s)]
*  route in Boston, running long distances in Portland, and running at high altitude in [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2243.16s)]
*  the mountains of Arizona. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2250.16s)]
*  All of it, every mile, dedicated to returning to Boston in peak form and winning the marathon. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2252.24s)]
*  To you, winning the Boston Marathon would be bigger than winning an Olympic medal. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2258.8s)]
*  Yeah, you could say, here Shalane, you have an Olympic medal or you could win the Boston [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2262.48s)]
*  Marathon. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2265.96s)]
*  A no-brainer to me would be winning the Boston Marathon. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2266.96s)]
*  Why? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2270.0s)]
*  It is personal. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2271.0s)]
*  It's where my inspiration started. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2272.56s)]
*  It's where I fell in love with running. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2275.36s)]
*  What would it mean for a local person, someone from Boston, won the women's race? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2277.44s)]
*  It would be super. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2282.76s)]
*  It would. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2283.76s)]
*  It would just signify how resilient this community is and how hard someone would train to make [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2284.76s)]
*  sure this was special for everyone. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2291.08s)]
*  So we'll go crazy. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2293.88s)]
*  The people who line the road certainly know any local runner who is there, so they will [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2295.84s)]
*  all know Shalane. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2301.8s)]
*  Do you think there are going to be a lot of people on the sidelines cheering for Shalane? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2302.8s)]
*  I think there will be a great many people on the sidelines cheering for Shalane. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2306.52s)]
*  Go Shalane, go Marblehead. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2309.84s)]
*  She'll need all the support she can get. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2313.68s)]
*  Last year's winner, Rita Jebtoe, will also be running again next week. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2316.04s)]
*  Is Rita Jebtoe beatable? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2321.5600000000004s)]
*  I believe so. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2322.96s)]
*  Anyone is beatable. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2324.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, Rita Jebtoe is a phenomenal athlete and I really admire her, but I know that on [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2325.1200000000003s)]
*  any given day I can beat her. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2329.92s)]
*  Beating Rita Jebtoe and her other opponents may come down to personal motivation, Shalane's [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2331.96s)]
*  anger and heartbreak over what happened in Boston last year. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2336.92s)]
*  It's probably not a day that goes by that I don't think about the events that unfolded [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2340.44s)]
*  there. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2345.1200000000003s)]
*  Did that add to your desire to run this year? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2346.1200000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2349.6s)]
*  After what happened with the bombs and everything that unfolded, it just gave more meaning and [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2350.6s)]
*  more incentive to pour everything I have into winning it. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2357.92s)]
*  A few months ago, we accompanied Shalane on one of her final practice runs along the Boston [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2362.12s)]
*  Marathon course. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2366.84s)]
*  Despite all her rigorous training, her constant study of the physiology and psychology of [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2368.36s)]
*  running, when it comes to the Boston Marathon, Shalane Flanagan isn't immune to a little [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2373.4s)]
*  superstition. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2378.92s)]
*  I don't cross it. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2379.92s)]
*  As many times as you've practiced in Boston leading up to this race, as many times as [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2382.32s)]
*  you've run on the actual course, you have yet to actually cross the finish line. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2386.04s)]
*  I've only crossed the finish line once. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2390.44s)]
*  Last year during the race. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2393.48s)]
*  Yes, and I haven't done it in practice, no. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2394.48s)]
*  So I'll save that for the day, for the real race. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loeRbGg7Ef0&t=2397.28s)]
