# Four stories from Morley Safer | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [March 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw)
*  17 years ago, 60 Minutes first examined the so-called French paradox, which suggested [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=0.0s)]
*  that the French, despite a high-fat diet and high consumption of wine, had a remarkably [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=19.18s)]
*  low incidence of heart disease compared with Americans. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Most researchers agreed that there was something in the wine that offered protection, and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=28.82s)]
*  a few years later even the highly cautious Federal Dietary Guidelines say that moderate [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=33.78s)]
*  consumption of red wine can be beneficial. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=39.34s)]
*  Now scientists across the country have identified a substance in red wine called resveratrol [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=42.7s)]
*  that they believe might do more than just protect the heart, but could, in very high [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=49.18s)]
*  significantly extend life by preventing a number of age-related illnesses. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=54.74s)]
*  If they're right, we all may soon be taking a pill that could give us an extra decade [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=60.38s)]
*  or two of healthy old age. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=65.66s)]
*  If the promise holds true, I think this has the chance to change health care. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=69.22s)]
*  Dr. Christophe Westphal says we all may soon be taking a drug that just might beat the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=74.18s)]
*  clock, a simple pill that could delay the inevitable. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=80.46s)]
*  Our goal is to prevent and forestall many of the diseases that strike us as we reach [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=84.69999999999999s)]
*  50, 60 and 70, all with one pill. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=89.41999999999999s)]
*  What you're suggesting is that it's some kind of rejuvenation drug that turns a 70-year-old [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=92.17999999999999s)]
*  into a 35-year-old. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=97.13999999999999s)]
*  That might be pretty hard to do, but I think if we're on a train heading one direction, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=98.82s)]
*  we can slow down that train. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  I think we can slow down these genes that control the aging process. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=104.86s)]
*  That quest to put death on hold began in 2003 when Westphal met David Sinclair, a biochemist [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=110.5s)]
*  at Harvard who was studying the genetic components of aging. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  Five years ago, I met David and he had shown that you could extend lifespan in yeast. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=122.66s)]
*  That's pretty exciting. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=128.5s)]
*  If you happen to be a yeast, it's very exciting. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=129.5s)]
*  Genes are one thing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=132.66s)]
*  Human beings are more complicated. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  So Sinclair focused on a gene present in almost all life forms, the sirtuin gene. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=136.62s)]
*  It's normally inactive, but when it is active, Sinclair believes it triggers a survival mechanism [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=142.94s)]
*  that extends life. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  Convinced that something in nature could activate that gene, Sinclair randomly tested thousands [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=151.94s)]
*  of compounds. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  And bingo, he got a hit. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=159.22s)]
*  Resveratrol. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=161.86s)]
*  When I googled this resveratrol, I was shocked to find that red wine was the top hit. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=163.46s)]
*  Red wine is brimming with resveratrol. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=169.78s)]
*  It's found in high concentration in the skin of the grape and seems to play a role in protecting [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=172.5s)]
*  it from invading bacteria and fungi. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=177.94000000000003s)]
*  Were you aware of the research into red wine that it offered certain health benefits? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=181.38000000000002s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's why I almost fell off my chair when the link was made and I thought that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  this was a potential explanation for the benefits of red wine. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  Convinced they were on the verge of a major scientific breakthrough, Sinclair and Westfall [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=195.94s)]
*  launched Sirtrus, a Cambridge, Massachusetts research company. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=200.61999999999998s)]
*  They along with a handful of other cutting edge biotech companies are developing resveratrol-based [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=205.5s)]
*  drugs that they believe zero in on the longevity gene. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=211.98s)]
*  The important news here is not that we found something in red wine. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=216.66s)]
*  The important thing is that we passed a milestone where we can now make drugs based on this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=221.1s)]
*  knowledge and potentially slow down aging itself. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=224.94s)]
*  Everyone from plastic surgeons to your friendly snake oil salesman have been promising a ticket [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=228.5s)]
*  to eternal youth for some time. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=233.5s)]
*  So the prospect of a prescription pill based on red wine that could trigger a longevity [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=235.94s)]
*  gene sounds too good to be true. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=241.54s)]
*  And yet, scientists have actually known for years of one surefire way of doing that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=244.66s)]
*  They're hungry. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=250.42s)]
*  Eating a lot of food turns that off. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=252.01999999999998s)]
*  Dieting, extreme dieting turns it on. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=254.1s)]
*  These rhesus monkeys are on a major diet. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=259.02s)]
*  For nearly two decades now, they've been taking in a good 30% fewer calories than their well-fed [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  brothers and sisters. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=268.78s)]
*  It's feeding time, I gather. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=270.46s)]
*  They're the centerpiece of a National Institutes of Health study at the University of Wisconsin [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=272.46s)]
*  on whether or not CR, calorie restriction, makes them healthier and extends their lives. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=278.3s)]
*  To maintain their sterile environment, we had to suit up to visit them with Ricky Coleman, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=285.14s)]
*  the project leader. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  These are two of our control animals here? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=292.06s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=294.18s)]
*  They are nearing the end of a typical monkey lifespan, about 27 years, and major differences [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=295.18s)]
*  in their overall health are becoming clear. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=301.7s)]
*  The difference is really obvious. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=304.82s)]
*  The skinny monkeys actually look younger, their coats are shinier, and fewer have arthritis. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=307.38s)]
*  And those chunky monkeys? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=313.7s)]
*  Many have diabetes, and a significantly higher number have cancer and heart disease. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=315.74s)]
*  Pound for pound, the lighter guys... [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=321.98s)]
*  Do better. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=324.02s)]
*  Do much better. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=325.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=326.02s)]
*  Dr. Richard Weindrück, who heads up the study, believes that calorie restriction turns on [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=327.02s)]
*  these monkeys' genetic survival switch. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=332.38s)]
*  A hungry life seems to lead to a longer life. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=335.1s)]
*  There is an emerging survival advantage for the monkeys on caloric restriction, and 50 [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=339.66s)]
*  percent of the normally fed animals have died, and maybe 25 percent of those on caloric restriction. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=346.02s)]
*  That's a pretty remarkable number. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=353.34000000000003s)]
*  Surely, those are strong indications that restricted calorie intake among humans would [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=355.3s)]
*  be extremely beneficial. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=361.22s)]
*  It appears to support that idea. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=363.3s)]
*  But our record as humans in staying on diets is pretty miserable. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=366.26s)]
*  And worsening. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=373.1s)]
*  So, it's a fat chance that we'll all be giving up our passion for greasy junk. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=374.1s)]
*  We consume tons more calories than we need. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=379.62s)]
*  But believe it or not, there are some Americans who just revel in their hunger. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=383.22s)]
*  I basically just have one meal a day. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=388.98s)]
*  Meet the Skinnies, members of CRS, the Calorie Restriction Society, a group that's been severely [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=391.66s)]
*  restricting their calories for years now. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=398.42s)]
*  They're also part of a Washington University study to see if humans mimic the monkeys. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=401.66s)]
*  Does this kind of self-denial make them live longer, healthier lives? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=408.1s)]
*  We join them for what they call Happy Hour. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=413.58000000000004s)]
*  So, this is in the spirit of a Bloody Mary. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=416.94000000000005s)]
*  So you might regard it as an unhappy hour. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=419.82s)]
*  A cocktail of low-calorie soup for starters and walnuts and baby food. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=422.54s)]
*  Green bean puree on flour-free bread to top off this feast fit for a flea. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=428.54s)]
*  If I'm hungry, I know, number one, that I have done what I meant to do. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=436.14s)]
*  I've eaten less than my body thought it wanted. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=440.62s)]
*  So far, the participants have lowered their blood pressure, reduced body fat and lessened [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=443.86s)]
*  risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and even cancer. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=448.98s)]
*  And what's more, to one husband anyway, starvation has its sexy side. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=453.58s)]
*  To be honest, if you saw her without any clothes, you'd see she looked pretty darn good, like [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=459.86s)]
*  a woman of many, many years younger. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=464.94s)]
*  Their emissaries travel the world, spreading the faith and the word. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=468.9s)]
*  Hunger turns on the survival gene. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=474.02s)]
*  I would like to live to be 100. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=476.42s)]
*  The skinnies may not die young, but given their diet, they just might die of boredom. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=481.02s)]
*  But if the scientists and searchers are on the right track, it could mean forget dieting, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=486.3s)]
*  forget the sweaty business of working out. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=492.7s)]
*  Just pop a pill and you are in guilt-free couch potato paradise. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=495.78s)]
*  We have a pill that can mimic many of the effects of calorie restriction or exercise. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=501.22s)]
*  So one could be very healthy and obese at the same time. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=506.54s)]
*  Our goal is healthy individuals, ideally via lifestyle, and if that doesn't work, we believe [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=509.86s)]
*  that we'll have a pill that can mimic that. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=516.7s)]
*  A pill that in effect diets for you. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=518.78s)]
*  A pill that turns on the survival gene. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=521.7s)]
*  What we're trying to do with our drugs here is to put the body in a defensive state, to [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=525.34s)]
*  ring the alarm bells and get the body to defend itself instead of dieting to set the alarm [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=530.24s)]
*  off, pop a pill. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=534.88s)]
*  The pill is a highly concentrated form of resveratrol, a virtual vineyard of healthy [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  living. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=543.12s)]
*  How much red wine would you have to drink to get the kind of resveratrol that you're [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=544.12s)]
*  using? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=548.8s)]
*  The sad news is that you'd need to drink about a thousand bottles a day of red wine, which [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=549.8s)]
*  I don't recommend. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=554.12s)]
*  The pill itself may not extend lifespan, but could prevent the diseases of aging, Alzheimer's, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=555.92s)]
*  diabetes, heart disease, even cancer. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=562.4799999999999s)]
*  What we're talking about is activating the body's natural genetic defenses against diseases, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=566.4s)]
*  and that's very powerful if we can harness that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=572.16s)]
*  Resveratrol has been tested on mice and the results have been encouraging. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=575.16s)]
*  In this test video provided by Cirteris, both of the mice have been fed a high-fat diet [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=579.02s)]
*  for 12 weeks. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=585.0s)]
*  But when placed on a treadmill, the mouse on the right ran twice as far. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=586.72s)]
*  He was taking high concentrations of resveratrol. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  You have fat mice and you have fat mice with resveratrol, and the ones that are on resveratrol, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=596.32s)]
*  they can run twice as far and they live longer, about 20% longer. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=601.9200000000001s)]
*  Other studies showed that among mice fed a high-fat diet, those given resveratrol didn't [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=606.62s)]
*  gain as much weight as those not given the drug. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=612.92s)]
*  Sinclair believes that resveratrol actually changes the physiology of the mice. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=616.84s)]
*  The proof, he says, is in the post-mortem. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=622.08s)]
*  Their organs looked pristine, youthful, fat-free, and their physiology was just like they were [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=625.56s)]
*  dieting, but they were fat. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=632.08s)]
*  Convinced they were on the right path, they fast-tracked the drug into human trials on [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=634.08s)]
*  people with untreated diabetes, and the results were impressive. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=639.6s)]
*  It significantly lowered glucose and insulin levels without the patients changing their [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=644.32s)]
*  diet or taking any other drugs. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=649.5600000000001s)]
*  Originally our hope was that you'd be able to prevent diseases of aging. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=653.24s)]
*  What we ended up seeing is actually you could therapeutically intervene in patients who have [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=658.0600000000001s)]
*  diseases of aging, and that was unexpected. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=662.44s)]
*  Yeah, the diabetic patients have high blood sugar and the molecules bring it down. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=664.44s)]
*  That's treatment, that's not prevention. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=669.04s)]
*  Circus is now developing what they say is a much more potent, synthetic version of resveratrol [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=671.56s)]
*  that will also soon go into human trials, this time on cancer patients. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=677.92s)]
*  I keep on thinking, you know, what used to seem like it was science fiction. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=683.7199999999999s)]
*  I actually believe the biology is right, and if we're right, this may be the most important [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=688.0799999999999s)]
*  thing that we're going to do in our lives. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=691.8399999999999s)]
*  Possibly, but it is important to remember that nine out of ten drugs that look good [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=694.04s)]
*  in mice ultimately fail in human trials. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=698.8399999999999s)]
*  Still, the speed and results generated by Circus and the resveratrol drugs are unusual. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=702.48s)]
*  In Sinclair beliefs, these drugs will not only keep people living longer, but will keep [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=709.9599999999999s)]
*  them healthy longer. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=714.8s)]
*  What we're talking about is potentially making a 90-year-old as healthy as a 60-year-old. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=717.04s)]
*  A 90-year-old can play tennis and see their great grandkids graduate from college. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=722.2399999999999s)]
*  People will live active, healthy lives and then die quietly in their sleep, and that's [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=727.8s)]
*  really the aim here with these medicines. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=731.68s)]
*  Are we on the edge of intending active lives into our hundreds, for example? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=733.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, we've certainly passed a corner in terms of the science, and someone's going to achieve [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=739.16s)]
*  it, and if it's not us, it's going to be someone else. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=744.4799999999999s)]
*  The question that most of us want answered is, when do we get this pill? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=747.84s)]
*  I would say five years to be conservative that this will happen within our lifetimes. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=753.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm fairly certain about that. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=758.08s)]
*  One measure of the potential of this research, Dr. Sinclair and Dr. Westfall's little startup [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=761.48s)]
*  company was recently bought by the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline for almost three-quarters [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=766.96s)]
*  of a billion dollars. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=774.72s)]
*  Here at 60 Minutes, we're pretty proud that we're now beginning our 42nd year on the air. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=777.84s)]
*  But as broadcasts go, we're merely middle-aged compared with the oldest established permanent [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=792.12s)]
*  floating soap opera ever broadcast. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=797.6s)]
*  Guiding Light is just finishing its 72nd year, and sadly for its fans, this Friday's broadcast [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=800.64s)]
*  will be its last. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=807.68s)]
*  Since Franklin Roosevelt's second term as president, Guiding Light has served up an [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=809.52s)]
*  endless menu of torrid love affairs, heartbreak, infidelities by the score, double crosses, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=814.14s)]
*  kidnaps, suicides, sin, sex, and salvation in all 20,000 episodes of Life on the Precipice. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=820.4s)]
*  What pushed Guiding Light over the edge is that old grim reaper of all television shows, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=829.16s)]
*  Low Ratings. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=834.8399999999999s)]
*  It's a bummer. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=836.6s)]
*  Guiding Light should never have been taken off the air. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=838.4s)]
*  It's a bittersweet time these last days as hardcore fans and the show's entire staff [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=843.2800000000001s)]
*  turned up for the taping of the final scenes. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=848.8000000000001s)]
*  Guiding Light has always been a loving reflection of America's morals, manners, and marital [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=854.0400000000001s)]
*  mayhem where actress Tina Sloan and many others have worked together for over a quarter [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=859.32s)]
*  century. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=865.4000000000001s)]
*  Were you guys surprised when the show got the pink slip? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=866.4000000000001s)]
*  The pink slip stunned us, all of us. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=869.8000000000001s)]
*  Even though we were on life support and we knew we were on life support, we just couldn't [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=872.4000000000001s)]
*  imagine anyone would pull the plug on their watch on a show that's been so historic. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=875.7600000000001s)]
*  The Guiding Light, the longest running dramatic show in the history of broadcasting. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=881.4000000000001s)]
*  It started on radio in 1937, made the transition to television in 1952, and through the years [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=888.24s)]
*  into a new century, Guiding Light chronicled family life in the mythical town of Springfield [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=896.0s)]
*  where everybody, it seemed, had a dark secret. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=902.76s)]
*  If you even consider telling Billy about the baby, I will never, never forget it. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=906.4000000000001s)]
*  A place where even the good guys have a lurid past. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=911.08s)]
*  Sit down. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=915.72s)]
*  Let me take you through some of your planting evidence. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=917.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=921.32s)]
*  Bribery. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=922.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=923.32s)]
*  Blackmail. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=924.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=925.32s)]
*  And all this done by a former preacher. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=926.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=929.48s)]
*  And your point would be... [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=931.36s)]
*  For the better part of a quarter century, Robert Newman and Kim Zimmer have played Springfield's [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=932.36s)]
*  star-crossed lovers, Josh and Reva. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=938.8000000000001s)]
*  Is this what you want? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=941.84s)]
*  I told you to stay away from me. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=942.84s)]
*  I warned you to stay away from me. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=943.84s)]
*  Marrying and divorcing each other three times. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=947.2s)]
*  And that's just for starters. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=950.64s)]
*  Take care of his family. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=952.2800000000001s)]
*  He married my sister. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=953.2800000000001s)]
*  She married my father and my brother. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=954.52s)]
*  Are we going to have this conversation now? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=957.32s)]
*  How many marriages have you had? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=959.64s)]
*  I believe I just had my ninth. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=961.44s)]
*  She once survived driving off a bridge in a fit of postpartum depression. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=964.64s)]
*  I can't believe this has happened. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=968.72s)]
*  He once had her clone. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=971.32s)]
*  Sit. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=973.2s)]
*  On the soaps, the weird and the wonderful are routine. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=974.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, if I just run into my whole family in the Caracas airport on Christmas Eve, I'd [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=979.0400000000001s)]
*  stop and chat. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=983.5200000000001s)]

*  I did a menopause story and then four years later I was pregnant on the show. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=988.12s)]
*  So how many times have you died? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=992.0s)]
*  I've been presumed dead three times, yeah. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=995.88s)]
*  And dead once? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=999.08s)]
*  I flatlined on a Friday. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1001.1600000000001s)]

*  I just want to know where my husband is and I want to know now. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1006.36s)]

*  And the medical help is somewhat dicey. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1015.32s)]
*  Dad, it could be the ninth, but we have to check it out. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1017.8000000000001s)]

*  The audition roles come up and that's the nature of the beast. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1495.24s)]
*  Very good job, so that's a wrap. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1499.88s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1503.3200000000002s)]
*  The ancient wisdom that there's a sucker born every minute has been especially pertinent [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1517.16s)]
*  given the financial disasters of the past few years. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1522.68s)]
*  So it's time for a short and painless test. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1526.32s)]
*  Are you sometimes just too trusting? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1529.9199999999998s)]
*  Do you invest in things you don't really understand? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1532.48s)]
*  Are you also a bit greedy? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1535.4399999999998s)]
*  Then you too could be suffering from pigeon fever. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1537.8s)]
*  Pigeons just so you know are what con men call their victims. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1541.4399999999998s)]
*  After a year of revelations about Bernard Madoff, who cheated investors out of billions, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1545.48s)]
*  you might think Americans have wised up. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1550.8999999999999s)]
*  Fat chance. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1553.6399999999999s)]
*  Prosecutors and regulators tell us that even in this age of skepticism, Ponzi schemes [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1555.24s)]
*  like Madoff's are thriving. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1561.0s)]
*  One regulator even calls it Ponzimonium. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1563.24s)]
*  Why are there so many pigeons around? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1567.1200000000001s)]
*  We asked a few people who should know. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1570.32s)]
*  As a student of con games and deception, were you at all surprised by the Bernie Madoff [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1574.1200000000001s)]
*  scam? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1579.56s)]
*  Would you be surprised if I told you that I predicted it? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1580.56s)]
*  For starters, we approached Ricky Jay, America's foremost card sharp, actor, sleight of hand [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1583.32s)]
*  artist, a man with an encyclopedic knowledge of con men, past and present. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1589.48s)]
*  He told us of a talk he gave seven years before Madoff's fall. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1595.4399999999998s)]
*  Beware of someone well established in the industry. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1600.72s)]
*  A lecture on financial fraud to a gathering of police officers in 2001. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1603.48s)]
*  I would also beware of someone who will rely heavily on an affiliation with an investor [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1609.44s)]
*  group, be it religious, ethnic or geographic. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1614.28s)]
*  He was describing Madoff to a T. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1618.0800000000002s)]
*  I think these elements will make the market ripe for any sort of pyramid or Ponzi scam [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1620.96s)]
*  Ricky Jay. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1625.64s)]
*  And that is pure Bernard Madoff. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1626.64s)]
*  It's pure Bernie Madoff. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1629.3s)]
*  But can I tell you another element of the con? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1631.16s)]
*  This is true. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1635.58s)]
*  I actually made this page on Photoshop last night and put it into this bulletin. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1636.58s)]
*  And I did that to prove a point. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1639.58s)]
*  And the point is... [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1641.8999999999999s)]
*  You got me. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1642.8999999999999s)]
*  Good. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1643.8999999999999s)]
*  You set it up by saying that I was a student of cons and that I'm knowledgeable in that [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1644.8999999999999s)]
*  area. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1649.22s)]
*  And so you allowed my supposed expertise to make you believe this is true. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1650.22s)]
*  This magazine is true. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1655.4399999999998s)]
*  I really have lectured to this group of police against confidence crime. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1656.8999999999999s)]
*  Everything is true except for this page which I slipped in last night. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1661.54s)]
*  So what's the moral? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1665.06s)]
*  Trust no one. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1667.58s)]
*  We wouldn't want to live in a world where we couldn't be conned because in effect we [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1668.6599999999999s)]
*  would then be living in a world where we mistrusted or refused to trust anyone. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1672.94s)]
*  So this is the price we pay. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1679.1s)]
*  And pay we have. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1681.7s)]
*  In the wake of the Madoff scandal, Ponzi perp walks have become a marathon. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1683.2s)]
*  Texas financier Allen Stanford accused of a $7 billion Ponzi scheme. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1688.26s)]
*  Minnesota businessman Tom Petters convicted recently of a $3 billion scam. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1694.54s)]
*  And Park Avenue lawyer Mark Dreier, mastermind of a mere $400 million Ponzi scheme that landed [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1701.5s)]
*  him first on 60 Minutes and then in federal prison. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1709.26s)]
*  I thought if somebody would ever interview me in a program such as yours it would be [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1713.8999999999999s)]
*  for something good I've done, not something humiliating I've done. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1717.6999999999998s)]
*  Despite the downfall of the Dreiers and the Madoffs, Ponzi operators large and small are [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1722.58s)]
*  busier than ever, knowing we're all capable of greed, misplaced trust and something else. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1728.3s)]
*  I think it's anxiety. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1735.62s)]
*  It's anxiety that you're losing out, that other people are doing better than you are. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1737.5s)]
*  Stephen Greenspan is a University of Colorado professor who writes and lectures on gullibility, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1741.78s)]
*  warning audiences that not reading the fine print or buying something on a tip from your [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1748.3799999999999s)]

*  pitch from a con man. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1760.34s)]
*  In most of the great moments of gullibility in history, the perpetrator seems to target [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1762.82s)]
*  a particular group, correct? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1769.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1771.78s)]
*  There have been Ponzi schemes targeting Mormons or fundamentalist Christians. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1772.78s)]
*  Madoff mostly was aimed at Jews because he was a prominent Jewish philanthropist. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1777.82s)]
*  So yes, there is this affiliation aspect though because we tend to trust our own kind. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1782.98s)]
*  Here in 1919 is Charles Ponzi, self-styled financial wizard, loafing at his Boston mansion [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1787.6200000000001s)]

*  Mr. Ponzi himself promised fellow Italian immigrants he could make them rich trading [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1797.3s)]
*  in postal reply coupons, sort of the prepaid phone cards of the day. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1802.78s)]
*  Ponzi went to prison and died a pauper. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1808.98s)]
*  I went out looking for trouble. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1811.6599999999999s)]
*  I found it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1813.58s)]
*  But his name lives on for the fraud he made famous. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1814.58s)]
*  The basic concept is robbing Peter to pay Paul. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1818.82s)]
*  You have a fund of new money coming in and you use the new money to pay the old investors, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1821.8999999999999s)]
*  but at a certain point that has to stop. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1827.28s)]
*  Gullibility is at the very core of this, correct? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1829.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1833.56s)]
*  I mean, history is filled with examples. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1834.56s)]
*  Mr. Jay's library is replete with documents about cons, scams and hoaxes of all kinds. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1836.8s)]
*  Amazing animals. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1843.84s)]
*  And the sinosophilus was often featured on circus lots and eventually people realized [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1844.84s)]
*  that the sinosophilus was a baboon wearing lateros. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1850.36s)]
*  Celebrated con men, including Count Victor Lustig. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1854.48s)]
*  This is an original wanted poster of the Count. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1858.6s)]
*  One of the things he did in France was he was able to sell the Eiffel Tower for scrap [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1861.84s)]
*  metal and he was able to do it twice, which is sort of wonderful. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1865.92s)]
*  Mr. Jay reports that over the years people really have tried to sell the Brooklyn Bridge [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1870.24s)]
*  as well as Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square in London. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1876.16s)]
*  But in another cautionary tale, still unfolding, pigeons were both the investors and the investment. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1880.28s)]
*  Arlen Galbraith, who called himself the Pigeon King, convinced hundreds of American and Canadian [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1888.72s)]
*  farmers there was good money to be made raising the birds for food. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1894.52s)]
*  And everybody we talked to said this guy was, he was on the up and up. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1900.04s)]
*  Nobody had a bad word to say about him anywhere that we could find. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1903.8799999999999s)]
*  So Arlen and Jolene Humbert, Ohio farmers, signed up. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1907.16s)]
*  I've had such tremendous demand for the live birds. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1911.5600000000002s)]
*  The Pigeon King assured investors that pigeons would replace chickens in every pot in America [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1915.0400000000002s)]
*  and the world. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1921.16s)]
*  He'd sell you breeding stock and buy back the offspring. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1922.72s)]
*  Soon, barns across the Midwest and Canada were filled to the rafters with birds and [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1926.4s)]
*  high hopes. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1932.6000000000001s)]
*  He was building his herd, building the flock. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1933.8400000000001s)]
*  He had to have so many hundreds of thousands of birds a week to supply his production. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1936.96s)]
*  But to some, including the Attorney General of Iowa, it sounded like a Ponzi scheme. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1942.72s)]
*  Iowa and three other states barred the Pigeon King from doing business. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1947.92s)]
*  And shortly after the Humberts bought in, Pigeon King International declared bankruptcy. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1953.08s)]
*  The Humberts lost $300,000, most of it borrowed money. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1958.88s)]
*  We've contacted everybody in the states we could think of, and you know, from elected [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1964.2s)]
*  officials to FBI to our local prosecutor. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1968.72s)]
*  And everybody says, yeah, obviously there's something wrong here. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1972.96s)]
*  It was a scam, but to prove it is going to be very difficult. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1975.8400000000001s)]
*  Galbraith declined our request for an interview. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1979.44s)]
*  Canadian police now say he was running a Ponzi scheme. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1982.44s)]
*  Do you blame yourselves at all? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1986.8000000000002s)]
*  To a point, we just didn't find the red flags popping up. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1989.52s)]
*  We tried it and then we lost. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1993.52s)]
*  I went to Vegas and put it all in red. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=1997.8799999999999s)]
*  We would have had a lot more fun. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2001.96s)]
*  At least in Vegas, you know, the odds always favor the house. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2005.12s)]
*  Elsewhere, even the most sophisticated among us can be had. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2009.24s)]
*  For instance, our gullibility expert, Stephen Greenspan, who, after writing a book on the [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2013.4s)]
*  subject, discovered he'd lost $400,000 of his retirement money to, who else? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2019.32s)]
*  Bernie Madoff. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2027.12s)]

*  Two days after I had the first book copy in my hand, I found that, well, it was painful, obviously. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2030.8s)]
*  And the fact was, Greenspan had never even heard of Madoff. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2037.36s)]
*  The hedge fund managing his retirement money had simply reinvested the $400,000 with Madoff. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2041.36s)]
*  I don't even think I read the prospectus. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2048.44s)]
*  I trusted the people I was turning my money over to and I've always done that and it's [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2051.52s)]

*  What did your wife say to you when you confessed that you'd lost part of your nest egg? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2058.32s)]
*  I told you so, because I had tried to tuck her into it. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2065.36s)]
*  And she said, I don't think so. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2069.1600000000003s)]
*  What made her suspicious? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2071.32s)]
*  Maybe it was the word hedge fund. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2072.92s)]
*  Which brings us to Wall Street and the financial meltdown of 2008. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2074.76s)]
*  Poking through the wreckage, many experts believe the root cause was a perfect storm. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2079.84s)]
*  A monsoon of gullibility colliding with a tidal wave of greed. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2086.0s)]
*  This was a massive Ponzi scheme and it's the biggest crime against the American economy [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2091.5200000000004s)]
*  in our lifetimes. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2096.42s)]

*  She argues that the bad mortgage loans that fueled the crisis were repackaged by investment [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2107.6800000000003s)]
*  banks, sliced into increasingly complex derivatives and resold to other investors, even though [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2113.32s)]
*  the underlying mortgages were often virtually worthless. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2120.26s)]
*  You had various traders buying each other's products to artificially keep the prices up [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2125.0s)]
*  so that the bubble didn't collapse. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2132.44s)]
*  Not only that, but the mortgage derivatives being traded were so mind-numbingly complicated, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2135.48s)]
*  nobody understood them fully. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2141.88s)]
*  Certainly not the pigeons, the buyers at banks, mutual funds, pension funds and insurance [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2144.4s)]
*  companies who wound up holding a bag full of worthless paper. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2150.68s)]

*  They're all graduates of the finest business schools in the country, correct? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2156.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2160.2799999999997s)]
*  If they were gullible, they're sophisticated investors. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2161.2799999999997s)]
*  So they can't really go back to the investment banks that sold them this product and said, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2164.08s)]
*  we've been had, because they held themselves out to be experts in these kinds of securities. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2170.0s)]
*  All of which proves that whether you're on Wall Street or Main Street, brain power is [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2175.84s)]
*  no defense against con men. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2181.0400000000004s)]
*  In fact, smart guys may be the biggest suckers of all. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2183.48s)]
*  As someone who does sleight of hand for a living, to me the ideal audience would be [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2187.8s)]
*  scientists or Nobel Prize winners who are incredibly smart in their one area and often, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2192.0s)]
*  often, not always, have an ego with them which says, I am really smart, so I can't be fooled. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2197.92s)]
*  No one is easier to fool. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2204.04s)]
*  So Morley, I'm going to play you one hand of blackjack with certain propositions that [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2205.96s)]
*  make it too good to be true. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2210.2s)]
*  And so determined not to be conned by him again, I sat down for a friendly card game [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2211.92s)]
*  with Mr. J. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2217.16s)]
*  You win all toys. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2218.32s)]
*  The rules were all stacked in my favor. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2220.84s)]
*  I got 20, he showed a nine, meaning I thought it was impossible for him to win. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2223.4s)]
*  And God, the only thing that could beat you would be if I had a 12 or something. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2230.48s)]
*  Which I do. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2235.2s)]
*  You see, I have the 12 of clubs. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2236.2s)]
*  So I have 21 to your 20. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2239.68s)]
*  But there's no such thing as a 12 of clubs, right? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2242.08s)]
*  Wrong. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2246.04s)]
*  Not only did Mr. J. manipulate the cards somehow to get the ones he wanted, he was also dealing [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2247.04s)]
*  from a deck used in certain rummy games that includes 11s, 12s and 13s. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2253.26s)]
*  This pigeon had been had again. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2260.36s)]
*  And the other real element of a con is that I told you this was too good to be true. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2263.36s)]
*  Anyone should stand clear of something that's too good to be true. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2268.92s)]
*  Because it never is. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2273.48s)]
*  It never is. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2274.48s)]
*  Despite some indications that the economy is recovering, the housing market remains [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2290.36s)]
*  a disaster area. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2299.88s)]
*  Currently, about 7 million homeowners are behind on their mortgages and that number [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2301.8s)]
*  is only getting worse. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2306.84s)]
*  Banks, with the help of the government, are offering some relief to homeowners who've [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2308.6800000000003s)]
*  lost jobs and just can't meet their payments. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2313.48s)]
*  But there's a growing number who can pay but are simply walking away from houses that [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2316.8s)]
*  are now worth as little as half of what they paid for them. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2321.7000000000003s)]
*  It's called strategic default. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2325.4s)]
*  People have done the math and decided making those monthly payments is just throwing money [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2327.84s)]
*  away, leaving the mortgage holders, the banks, as zookeepers of an ever-growing parade of [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2333.04s)]
*  white elephants. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2339.7200000000003s)]
*  In the past year, it's estimated that at least a million Americans who can afford to [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2340.7200000000003s)]
*  stay in their homes simply walked away. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2345.8s)]
*  Among them, Chris Deener and his wife Dana of Sun City, Arizona. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2350.2000000000003s)]
*  West Foothill Drive has become a street of shattered dreams. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2355.5600000000004s)]
*  Amazingly, we have 16 out of the 44 houses on the street have foreclosed over the last [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2359.84s)]

*  And yours over here? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2366.5600000000004s)]
*  Mine will be number 17. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2367.7200000000003s)]
*  When Deener, an auditor for a local university, bought his three-bedroom house in 2006 for [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2369.64s)]
*  $262,000, he thought he got a bargain. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2376.2s)]
*  First-time home buyers, we don't know. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2381.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, houses are overvalued. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2383.24s)]
*  We just know we need to get in before it keeps going up and up and up. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2384.7599999999998s)]
*  And then? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2388.8399999999997s)]
*  And then, boom. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2389.8399999999997s)]
*  The balloon burst. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2391.7999999999997s)]
*  So how much does he think he could get for that $262,000 house today? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2393.36s)]
*  Right now, about $142,000. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2399.6400000000003s)]
*  That's a big drop. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2400.6400000000003s)]
*  Big drop. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2401.6400000000003s)]
*  Over 43%. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2402.6400000000003s)]
*  Deener and his house were, as they say, underwater. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2403.6400000000003s)]
*  With a mortgage of about a quarter of a million dollars and a home worth less than $150,000, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2410.2400000000002s)]
*  he has won very expensive lemon. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2416.36s)]
*  He says he tried to talk his bank into renegotiating his mortgage, but because he earns enough [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2419.56s)]
*  to keep paying, the bank said no deal. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2425.04s)]
*  They refused to. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2428.6s)]
*  They said it was going to affect my credit and they were going to take my house. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2429.6s)]
*  And I pretty much said, go for it. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2432.56s)]
*  But you can afford to stay here, correct? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2434.88s)]
*  I could, yeah. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2437.32s)]
*  But he chose not to. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2439.4s)]
*  He's walking away. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2440.92s)]
*  That lemon of a house is now the bank's problem. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2442.64s)]
*  It's almost like the end thing to do right now, it seems like. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2445.7599999999998s)]
*  And because Deener, like many Americans, only made a 10% down payment on his home, taking [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2449.7599999999998s)]
*  a hike is a lot easier. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2454.7599999999998s)]
*  By law in Arizona and nine other states, the bank cannot go after any of his other assets. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2457.3199999999997s)]
*  But his credit rating will suffer. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2464.16s)]
*  Aren't you fearful that you're going to get a reputation as big a deadbeat? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2466.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2471.3199999999997s)]
*  But with the money savings that I will have in four to six years, I'm confident I will [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2472.3199999999997s)]
*  have enough money to buy my way into a house if I want to. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2476.2s)]
*  And you don't feel any, even a twinge of guilt? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2480.0s)]
*  No. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2482.7999999999997s)]
*  Especially after dealing with my lender trying to contact them. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2483.7999999999997s)]
*  None at all. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2486.2s)]
*  Neither do Gene Ellen Shulik and Danny Kuhn. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2487.88s)]
*  They bought their Phoenix bungalow three years ago for nearly $400,000. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2491.4s)]
*  The bank now values it at $85,000. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2496.86s)]
*  Even though they can afford the mortgage payments, they felt they were trying to bail out a notion [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2500.88s)]
*  with a bucket. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2506.52s)]
*  No logical business person would do anything other than walk away. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2508.3999999999996s)]
*  And so there was a lot of soul searching and I did a lot of crying because I'm in love [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2512.72s)]
*  with this house. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2516.64s)]
*  And every day I would redo the math and think, maybe we missed something. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2518.8399999999997s)]
*  This just can't be right. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2522.56s)]
*  But it was. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2524.56s)]
*  The value of their house was dropping anywhere from $5,000 to $8,000 a month. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2525.6s)]
*  So Shulik and Kuhn just felt it was time to walk away. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2530.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't think we're villains. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2535.8799999999997s)]
*  We fulfilled the parts of our contract that we have with the bank. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2538.04s)]
*  We've let them know what we're doing. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2541.68s)]
*  It's all legal. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2544.32s)]
*  It's not anything I ever expected I would be doing and it sure doesn't feel good. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2545.44s)]
*  But it seems like it's the right thing to do. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2551.24s)]
*  What do your neighbors make of another empty house? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2553.8s)]
*  Brings down the value of everyone's house? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2556.6s)]
*  And we've seen that here. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2558.84s)]
*  I think they will be upset and I understand that. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2559.84s)]
*  But you're hardly alone in Phoenix right now. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2563.0s)]
*  It's interesting the number of my coworkers who have approached me to say, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2566.08s)]
*  how are you doing this? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2569.56s)]
*  Because I need to do it. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2571.04s)]
*  The Southwest has become an inland ocean of bad mortgage debt. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2572.84s)]
*  Here in Arizona, a full 50% of houses are underwater. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2577.52s)]
*  And next door in Nevada, it's even worse. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2582.6s)]
*  65% of houses there are drowning and the water's rising. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2585.36s)]
*  And it's not just the Southwest. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2591.68s)]
*  More than 11 million homeowners across the country are underwater. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2593.88s)]
*  It's estimated that number could double in the next year, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2598.44s)]
*  which means nearly half of all American mortgage holders [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2601.84s)]
*  will owe more on their homes than those homes are currently worth. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2605.6000000000004s)]
*  We've been through an event that none of us have ever experienced [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2609.96s)]
*  in this country since the Depression. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2614.8s)]
*  To try to stem the tide of foreclosures, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2617.2000000000003s)]
*  the Commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2619.84s)]
*  says the Obama administration has set aside billions to give banks [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2624.04s)]
*  the incentive to help struggling and underwater borrowers [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2628.84s)]
*  with their mortgages. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2632.68s)]
*  But banks have been slow to modify the terms of those loans. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2634.36s)]
*  The fact of the matter is, these programs are designed to affect [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2638.64s)]
*  those who are most at risk who are unable to make their payments. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2641.96s)]
*  And it does require the investor, the servicer to participate. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2644.92s)]
*  The decision to walk away from the sinking home... [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2648.88s)]
*  by people who can't afford to pay, is spreading like a virus. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2653.4s)]
*  Because if one person in the street does it, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2658.0s)]
*  the next door neighbor says, what am I doing? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2660.96s)]
*  Why am I putting all this money into this almost worthless house? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2663.88s)]
*  The concern has to be, for someone who's going to take that move, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2669.48s)]
*  is that they have to be so deeply in negative equity [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2674.48s)]
*  that they're willing to damage their credit, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2677.8s)]
*  damage their financial reputation going forward. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2680.68s)]
*  If you get foreclosed on in your home, you walk away from your mortgage, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2683.24s)]
*  when you could have afforded it particularly, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2686.44s)]
*  that's going to follow that family for years to come. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2688.96s)]
*  This is You Walk Away calling in response to your online inquiry. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2691.96s)]
*  But Chad Ruhl, co-founder of a new business called YouWalkAway.com, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2695.64s)]
*  says fears of the consequences are overblown. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2700.8s)]
*  People think that if they're late on their payment or they defaulted, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2704.68s)]
*  that a sheriff's going to come the next day and rip them out of the home. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2708.96s)]
*  What we do is offer people a peace of mind right away, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2712.28s)]
*  that they know that's not going to happen. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2715.08s)]
*  I'm going to be here for you throughout the entire time, so you can always... [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2717.52s)]
*  The website urges underwater homeowners to unshackle themselves [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2720.32s)]
*  from their mortgage obligations, and for a price, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2725.0s)]
*  walks them through the process of walking away. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2728.88s)]
*  Ruhl says his greatest challenge is convincing people [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2733.6800000000003s)]
*  that they are not immoral. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2737.2s)]
*  The biggest concern people have, our customers have, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2739.52s)]
*  is this stigma of foreclosing and what will the neighbors think. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2743.8399999999997s)]
*  But as more and more people are foreclosing, that stigma is wearing off. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2747.7999999999997s)]
*  People are realizing now that there isn't shame in defaulting. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2753.2799999999997s)]
*  The banks don't feel shame by foreclosing on a person's home. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2758.16s)]
*  So you're saying we should all be acting like bankers? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2761.8799999999997s)]
*  Sure, I mean, it's a business transaction. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2765.16s)]
*  Brent White, a law professor at the University of Arizona, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2768.96s)]
*  says the moral issue is beside the point. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2772.7999999999997s)]
*  In a controversial academic paper, he wrote that government and the banks [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2776.64s)]
*  exploit people's sense of shame to keep them from defaulting. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2781.88s)]
*  White says more people should be walking. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2786.52s)]
*  You won't find a time in history where this many Americans [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2789.7599999999998s)]
*  were underwater on their mortgage. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2792.8399999999997s)]
*  You won't find a time where this many people's homes [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2794.64s)]
*  are worth half of what they pay for their homes. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2797.7599999999998s)]
*  These are unique times and things are different. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2800.8399999999997s)]
*  As a child of the Depression, let me tell you that the most shameful thing [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2803.16s)]
*  that could happen to you was to lose your house. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2807.3599999999997s)]
*  My argument is, in fact, that people feel too shameful [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2810.3599999999997s)]
*  about letting go of their home. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2813.44s)]
*  And in fact, people might be better off making economic decisions, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2815.52s)]
*  rational decisions in their best interest. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2819.44s)]
*  White says big businesses make such bottom-line decisions all the time. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2822.24s)]
*  Morgan Stanley walked away from five San Francisco office buildings [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2826.8799999999997s)]
*  they bought at the height of the boom. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2831.68s)]
*  And real estate developer Tishman Spire [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2834.4399999999996s)]
*  defaulted on the huge $5.4 billion Stuyvesantown apartment complex [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2837.2s)]
*  in New York City earlier this year when its value fell by nearly half, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2842.7999999999997s)]
*  making it one of the biggest walkaways in real estate history. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2848.32s)]
*  It's a trend the bank's sphere could catch on with average homeowners. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2852.76s)]
*  Already, the CEO of Citibank's mortgage unit estimates [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2856.5600000000004s)]
*  that one in five borrowers who default on their mortgages are able to pay. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2860.6000000000004s)]
*  If that number rises, it could jeopardize any economic recovery. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2866.84s)]
*  No bank we contacted would talk publicly about strategic defaults, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2871.28s)]
*  but all indicated they'd be unwilling in most cases [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2876.16s)]
*  to help underwater homeowners who can't afford to keep up their payments. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2880.0s)]
*  And Commissioner Stevens agrees with the banks. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2885.3599999999997s)]
*  To simply allow anybody who just decides they don't want their home anymore, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2888.8399999999997s)]
*  who signed a contract to purchase a home, to walk away [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2892.72s)]
*  and get some sort of write-off with a program backed by the administration [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2896.16s)]
*  or a financial institution, creates a whole new set of standards [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2901.3199999999997s)]
*  that will live with us for years to come. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2904.64s)]
*  The question is, who pays that bill? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2906.52s)]
*  For now, that bill is being paid by people like businessman Tom Hanson [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2908.92s)]
*  of Scottsdale, Arizona. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2913.48s)]
*  He bought his dream house on Goldust Avenue five years ago. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2915.6s)]
*  Much of the gold has evaporated and he's left with a pile of dust. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2920.3199999999997s)]
*  I paid a million, two for the house. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2925.4s)]
*  What's its value today? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2929.44s)]
*  850,000, if you can sell it. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2931.8s)]
*  While his friends are urging him to unload that monkey on his back, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2934.84s)]
*  Hanson just can't bring himself to do it yet. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2940.36s)]
*  I just would not be comfortable walking away. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2944.5600000000004s)]
*  And so, you know, maybe at some point in time I will walk away, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2947.28s)]
*  but right now I'm not. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2951.84s)]
*  What you're saying is it really comes down to conscience. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2953.6000000000004s)]
*  I think it does. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2956.44s)]
*  You could probably rent a pretty grand house at lower rent [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2958.2799999999997s)]
*  than you're paying right now as mortgage payments. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2963.72s)]
*  Absolutely. Good. Probably half. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2966.4s)]
*  I mean, you are attached to the house, correct? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2969.2s)]
*  Oh, I am. I love the house. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2971.44s)]
*  So I'd have to go find a house that I liked better? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2974.0s)]
*  It's an expensive love affair. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2977.72s)]
*  Aren't they all? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2980.96s)]
*  But the Deaners, who stopped paying their mortgage five months ago, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2983.96s)]
*  plan to stay in their house for free until the bank forecloses in July. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2988.04s)]
*  Then, with all the money they save, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2992.96s)]
*  they plan to rent a nicer, cheaper house for a few years [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2995.36s)]
*  while his credit recovers. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=2999.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, there are people saying if everybody did what you're doing, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=3001.7200000000003s)]
*  the country would be in even bigger, deeper trouble than it is right now. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=3005.56s)]
*  If that starts happening, that's for the professionals to figure out. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=3011.28s)]
*  How did you used to feel about people who walked away? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=3014.2s)]
*  I thought initially it wasn't moral. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=3017.4s)]
*  My family raised me to believe that you should [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfakoV4I-Hw&t=3019.56s)]
