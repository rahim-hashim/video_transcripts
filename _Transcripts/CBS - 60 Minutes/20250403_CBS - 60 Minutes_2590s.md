**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ)
*  Israeli hostages, recently released by the terror group Hamas, share their pleas for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a ceasefire and return of those still held in Gaza. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=13.8s)]
*  If you could say something to President Trump, what would you say? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=18.6s)]
*  Please stop this war and help bring all the hostages back. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=23.76s)]
*  Do you think he can help? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=28.98s)]
*  I know he can help. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=30.78s)]
*  I'm here because of Trump. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=31.9s)]
*  I'm here only because of him. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=34.06s)]
*  The Voice of America was launched during World War II to counter Nazi propaganda and was [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=38.06s)]
*  broadcast around the world uninterrupted for 83 years until two weeks ago. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=43.6s)]
*  So what do you think that says to your listeners and viewers? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=50.74s)]
*  I think it would make them wonder what the hell is going on in the United States. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=54.82s)]
*  These are the remnants of all the synthetic stuff that makes up modern life after it burned [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=65.98s)]
*  in the Los Angeles wildfires. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=70.62s)]
*  60 Minutes was with the Environmental Protection Agency as it began removing all the hazardous [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=73.5s)]
*  waste, including electric vehicles. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=78.86s)]
*  Their batteries can explode when damaged. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=82.1s)]
*  It sounds like you're treating these batteries almost like a live grenade in the field. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=85.86s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=93.86s)]

*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  Statistics tell the grim story of the October 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=112.1s)]
*  1,200 civilians and soldiers slaughtered that day. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=124.22s)]
*  251 taken hostage, men, women, and children. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=128.42s)]
*  Since then, an estimated 50,000 Gazans have been killed. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=133.74s)]
*  Twelve days ago, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu resumed the bombing of Gaza, breaking a fragile [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  ceasefire that was exceedingly popular with Israelis. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=145.78s)]
*  Two dozen hostages came home alive in that ceasefire. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=150.18s)]
*  Now, instead of quietly healing, many of them frail, traumatized, and in pain are out campaigning [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=154.02s)]
*  for the release of all the 24 remaining hostages still believed to be alive, suffering in the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=162.5s)]
*  Gaza tunnels. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=169.66s)]
*  This weekend, new talks around a possible ceasefire have been reported that would include [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=171.74s)]
*  releasing a handful of them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=177.68s)]
*  The anguish of Yordan Bebas, forced to sit on camera after he's told by Hamas that his [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=182.54s)]
*  wife and sons were blown up in an Israeli air raid, though he now knows that the boys [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=189.52s)]
*  were killed by their captors. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=196.8s)]
*  They were murdered in cold blood, bare hands. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  They used to tell me, doesn't matter, you get a new wife, get a new kid, better wife, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  better kids. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=212.28s)]
*  They said that to you? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=213.28s)]
*  Yeah, many times. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=214.28s)]
*  Many times. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  His wife Shiri and two redheaded sons, four-year-old Ariel and nine-month-old Kfeir, became the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=219.08s)]
*  symbol of the horror of October 7th, when they were kidnapped out of their home while [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  Yordan was driven off to Gaza on a motorcycle, swarmed and beaten by an angry mob. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=235.56s)]
*  He was released last month in a stage ceremony, sent home thanks to a ceasefire. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=246.42s)]
*  The bodies of his wife and sons were returned later. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=255.33999999999997s)]
*  Just four days after burying them, he made a public appeal. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=259.12s)]
*  You wrote a letter to Prime Minister Netanyahu that was read aloud, and it was really a plea [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=264.26s)]
*  to stop the fighting. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=271.38s)]
*  Yeah, because we still have people there. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=272.98s)]
*  But don't you think that the fighting will encourage them to release the hostages? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=275.58s)]
*  No. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=281.82s)]
*  No? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=282.82s)]
*  No. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=283.82s)]
*  The fighting resumed despite a ceasefire agreement in place that would have eventually [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=284.82s)]
*  ended the war in exchange for all the remaining hostages. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=291.58s)]
*  This is Bebas's first interview. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=296.2s)]
*  He chose an American outlet, he said, so the White House would hear his message. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=298.65999999999997s)]
*  If you could say something to President Trump, what would you say? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=304.38s)]
*  Please stop this war and help bring all the hostages back. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=309.54s)]
*  And you think he can help? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=315.5s)]
*  I know he can help. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=317.26s)]
*  I'm here because of Trump. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=318.5s)]
*  I'm here only because of him. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=320.65999999999997s)]
*  I think he's the only one who can stop this war again. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=322.78s)]
*  So you think he can bring about another ceasefire? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=325.94s)]
*  He has to convince Netanyahu, convince Hamas. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=329.26s)]
*  I think he can do it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=331.94s)]
*  The lives of the hostages still there, Bebas says, are jeopardized every moment the bombing [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=333.84s)]
*  continues and he knows. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=339.56s)]
*  You were held mostly in the tunnels? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=346.56s)]
*  So when there was fighting going on, when the IDF was bombing, life got worse? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=347.56s)]
*  It's scary. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  You don't know when it's going to happen. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  And when it happens, you're afraid for your life. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=358.12s)]
*  The whole earth would move like an earthquake but underground. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=363.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=366.88s)]
*  So everything could collapse any moment. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=369.2s)]
*  Weighing on Bebas is that his best friend is still in Gaza. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=372.16s)]
*  David Cunio was kidnapped with his wife Sharon and two kids. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=376.6s)]
*  They came home, he did not. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=381.48s)]
*  This is David. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=384.6s)]
*  I know him from first grade. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=385.6s)]
*  And this is his younger brother Ariel. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=388.08s)]
*  And they're both still in captivity? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=389.64s)]
*  And I don't know if they gave enough food, enough water, especially now when the war [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=392.4s)]
*  is back on. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=399.88s)]
*  Tell us about the friendship. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=401.64s)]
*  We did everything together. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=403.4s)]
*  He was with me in every big thing in my life. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  He was in my wedding and now I'm having probably the hardest thing I have to move with my life [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=408.0s)]
*  and David is not with me. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=416.58s)]
*  I lost my wife and kids. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=418.64s)]
*  Sharon must not lose her husband. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=420.56s)]
*  Hours after the bombing resumed, Bebas stood in silent protest alongside another recently [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=424.68s)]
*  released hostage, Keith Siegel. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  This war must end. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=434.4s)]
*  Keith, who's Israeli-American and his wife Aviva, had gone to the White House to thank [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=435.96s)]
*  President Trump for their release. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=441.56s)]
*  Mr. President, please take care of yourself. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=443.88s)]
*  This is your house? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=447.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=448.12s)]
*  This is my house. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=449.12s)]
*  They showed us where they were kidnapped, their old house in a kibbutz near the border [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=450.12s)]
*  with Gaza. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=454.48s)]
*  I stood here. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=455.48s)]
*  They forced me out of the window and they pushed me out of the window while I had to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=457.16s)]
*  go all the way there. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=460.64s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=461.64s)]
*  I was in shock. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=462.64s)]
*  I was in shock. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=463.64s)]
*  We were driven into Gaza and then taken into a tunnel, feeling in danger, feeling life-threatened. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=466.44s)]
*  Terrorists around us with weapons. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=473.16s)]
*  Could you breathe? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=475.04s)]
*  Was there enough oxygen down there? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  We were gasping for our breath. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=478.16s)]
*  Aviva was with her husband for 51 days until she was released during a brief ceasefire [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=480.24s)]
*  in 2023. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=486.92s)]
*  They were held with several women and children and said there was constant abuse. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=489.20000000000005s)]
*  I witnessed a young woman who was being tortured by the terrorists. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=495.6s)]
*  I mean literal, you know, torture, not just in a figurative sense. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=501.12s)]
*  They made you watch it? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=506.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=508.0s)]
*  I saw sexual assault with female hostages. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=509.0s)]
*  Keith says things got worse for him after Aviva was released and that early ceasefire [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=512.8s)]
*  collapsed. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=518.4s)]
*  The terrorists became very mean and very cruel and violent. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=519.68s)]
*  More so. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=524.96s)]
*  Much more so. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=525.96s)]
*  They were beating me and starving me. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  Do you think they starved you or they just didn't have food? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=529.32s)]
*  No, I think they starved me and they would often eat in front of me and not offer me [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=532.12s)]
*  food. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=537.88s)]
*  Did they let you take showers? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=538.88s)]
*  Once a month. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  It was like a half a bucket of water with a cup to like pour over our body. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=541.8000000000001s)]
*  Cold water. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=548.96s)]
*  I had heard that they shaved the men's heads in private parts. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=550.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=556.76s)]
*  This is true. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=558.12s)]
*  Do you know why? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=559.12s)]
*  I think they thought it was maybe it amused them or you know humiliated. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=560.36s)]
*  I felt humiliated. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=566.52s)]
*  You told us that your spirit was broken. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=568.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=572.64s)]
*  I felt that I was completely dependent on the terrorists, that my life relied on them, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=574.0s)]
*  whether they were going to give me food, bring me water, protect me from the mobs that would [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=580.04s)]
*  lynch me. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=585.32s)]
*  I was left alone several times and I was very, very scared that maybe they won't come back [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=586.52s)]
*  and I'll be left there. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=594.4s)]
*  And what do I do then? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=595.88s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=596.88s)]
*  What do I do then? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=597.88s)]
*  So maybe that was a way for them to torture me in that way, in a psychological way. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=599.3199999999999s)]
*  Make me think, okay, should I escape? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=605.3199999999999s)]
*  Should I not escape? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=607.96s)]
*  Should I try to escape? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=608.96s)]
*  But I'm pretty sure they knew I wouldn't dare to do that because I needed them. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=610.74s)]
*  They murdered and they kidnapped and they also burned. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=616.2s)]
*  Back at their destroyed kibbutz, Aviva spoke of two neighbors still languishing in Gaza. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=620.04s)]
*  There needs to be a deal that will bring them back and finish with this whole thing. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=626.08s)]
*  Also still in Gaza, best friends Guy Gilboa Dalal and Evyatar David. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=632.92s)]
*  Hamas kidnapped them from the Nova Music Festival, taking them deep into enemy territory. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=639.72s)]
*  Recently released 40-year-old Tal Shoaham spent 471 days with them in captivity. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=647.5600000000001s)]
*  After I met Guy and Evyatar. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=655.72s)]
*  He met their parents to tell them about their sons. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=659.08s)]
*  There are families in situations like this now, all over Israel, where released hostages [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=663.08s)]
*  are telling families the conditions of their children. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=671.08s)]
*  It's important for us to know exactly what's going on with our children. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=675.64s)]
*  You're prepared, you think? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=681.4000000000001s)]
*  No, maybe. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=684.0400000000001s)]
*  It's hard for anyone to be prepared, especially when it's your kids. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=686.6800000000001s)]
*  And Tal didn't hold back, telling Guy's parents. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=691.94s)]
*  One moment is like parting in the Nova. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=695.94s)]
*  The second moment is in the worst place in the world. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=699.62s)]
*  And it took him, I think, five or six days just to stop crying, to start to realize that [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=703.46s)]
*  this is the reality now. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=711.34s)]
*  Tal said they were mostly confined to a narrow tunnel like this, beaten every day and made [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=713.0600000000001s)]
*  to share minute amounts of pita, rice and water. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=720.14s)]
*  Like sometimes the water tastes like blood, sometimes like iron, sometimes it was so salty [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=724.42s)]
*  that you could not drink it but you don't have anything else. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=730.7s)]
*  You don't need too much to stay alive. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=733.9s)]
*  You can eat only one bread every day and have like 200 milliliters of water every day and [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=736.54s)]
*  you will stay alive. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=744.2s)]
*  You proved you could do it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=745.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=746.9s)]
*  The main guard actually said I can bring you this kind of amount of food and you will survive [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=747.92s)]
*  and you will keep like that for five years and you won't die but you will have like the [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=755.04s)]
*  worst time. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=761.48s)]
*  But they were resourceful, coming up with odd ways to win favors. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=763.16s)]
*  For instance, they discovered one of the guards liked back rubs. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=768.34s)]
*  So we did exchange. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=772.96s)]
*  The exchange was that he will get a massage every day and he will bring us some more food [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=774.38s)]
*  and different food like a can of meat. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=779.76s)]
*  You bartered? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=782.2s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=783.2s)]
*  The can of tuna or sardines. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=784.2s)]
*  How are you listening to this? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=786.52s)]
*  I want everyone to listen because this is the reality. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=788.76s)]
*  Maybe someone will hear it and he will save our sons. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=795.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=801.0s)]
*  It was the... how to treat animals. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=803.16s)]
*  One of the toughest things that I heard from them, they told me more than once that why [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=808.02s)]
*  to stay alive now? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=814.56s)]
*  I mean, why just to not take their own life with their own hands and to finish it? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=816.06s)]
*  I mean, to get released from this. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=821.86s)]
*  And they will do it together if they decide to do it. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=823.86s)]
*  They are not children, but from time to time I felt like a father. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=829.02s)]
*  They are... sorry. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=833.5s)]
*  They are all children. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=836.5s)]
*  I really, really fear that they are now alone. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=842.5799999999999s)]
*  Tormenting them further for the world to see, Hamas brought Guy and Evje in a van to watch [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=846.8199999999999s)]
*  fellow hostages leave and beg for their own release. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=853.9s)]
*  Please, all I want is to go back home. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=858.3399999999999s)]
*  And then they move them back to their tunnels. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=864.26s)]
*  So this can be... [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=867.2199999999999s)]
*  I don't know how you could watch that. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=869.06s)]
*  It was a sign of life. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=873.14s)]
*  There's so much trauma. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=875.9799999999999s)]
*  Now home, Keith Siegel spends his time at vigils and protests instead of quietly healing. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=880.38s)]
*  So in a way, you're still there. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=887.7s)]
*  Your mind is still there. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=891.7800000000001s)]
*  It is. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=893.5s)]
*  Every day. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=895.74s)]
*  Most of the day. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=896.74s)]
*  You're thinking about who's left behind. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=897.94s)]
*  He and the others are fighting for those left behind while still in their own pain. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=901.46s)]
*  Feeling a sense of urgency and fear that time is running out. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=909.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=915.5s)]
*  A reunion with an Israeli soldier held hostage. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=925.26s)]
*  So much fear that we were together. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=929.18s)]
*  At 60minutesovertime.com. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=931.42s)]
*  Tonight, the voice of America is silent. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=938.78s)]
*  The storied broadcaster was launched in 1942 to counter Nazi propaganda. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=941.78s)]
*  But two weeks ago, President Donald Trump usurped Congress's authority and signed [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=947.3399999999999s)]
*  an executive order, effectively shutting down the taxpayer-funded broadcaster for what the [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=952.4599999999999s)]
*  White House calls radical propaganda. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=958.14s)]
*  Friday, a federal judge put any further actions by the administration on hold. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=960.74s)]
*  Over the decades, VOA has projected American values globally. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=966.9s)]
*  And for hundreds of millions, it was the place to find fact-based news about America and [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=971.62s)]
*  the world in their own languages. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=977.4599999999999s)]
*  It all came crashing down in a single day. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=980.34s)]
*  When I heard that 1,300 of my colleagues had been suspended immediately with pay in an [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=985.38s)]
*  email saying that they couldn't do any more work, couldn't go into the building, I knew [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=996.1s)]
*  at that point the voice of America was going to die very quickly. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1000.34s)]
*  Steve Herman is chief national correspondent for Voice of America and perhaps its best-known [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1007.54s)]
*  journalist. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1012.98s)]
*  Americans may not recognize him since VOA is prohibited by law from broadcasting in [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1014.7s)]
*  the United States. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1019.9000000000001s)]
*  People say, oh, international broadcasting, it's archaic, it's obsolete. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1021.62s)]
*  Why are the Chinese spending so much money and broadcasting in dozens of languages over [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1026.94s)]
*  radio and setting up all these TV services? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1033.5s)]
*  You know, are they wasting their money? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1036.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1037.94s)]
*  VOA is probably the best bang for our buck that we have in terms of public diplomacy. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1039.58s)]
*  After joining VOA in 2002 as a Tokyo-based foreign correspondent, Herman spent the next [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1052.34s)]
*  15 years covering the globe for America's flagship international broadcaster before [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1058.54s)]
*  landing at the White House in 2017. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1064.62s)]
*  He told us he decided to take the job as a federal employee because of VOA's charter, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1068.02s)]
*  which requires accurate, objective reporting and sets a firewall to protect the editorial [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1074.18s)]
*  independence of its reporters from political meddling. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1080.06s)]
*  I've met people even in North Korea who have said when they first started listening to [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1083.74s)]
*  it and they heard it's from the United States that it must be propaganda because that's [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1091.46s)]
*  what their broadcasters do. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1097.26s)]
*  And then they heard us talking about America, warts and all, and they also heard us reporting [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1100.1s)]
*  about their own country and telling them things that they could verify with their own eyes [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1107.5s)]
*  that their own media wasn't telling them. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1114.02s)]
*  And a light bulb goes off when they realize what it is like with the media in the United [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1118.62s)]
*  States that you can criticize your own government, have opposition politicians on the air. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1124.62s)]
*  That doesn't happen everywhere in the world. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1131.8999999999999s)]
*  Our mandate was never to present the administration story. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1134.34s)]
*  Our mandate was always to present America's story. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1138.94s)]
*  Patsy Wita Kuswara is VOA's White House bureau chief. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1141.94s)]
*  A native of Indonesia, she started working for VOA in its Indonesian service in 2003. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1145.8999999999999s)]
*  Growing up under the dictatorship of President Suharto, she understands the value of VOA. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1152.8200000000002s)]
*  What's the size of the audience? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1159.3000000000002s)]
*  All around the world it is 360 million, weekly, unduplicated. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1160.94s)]
*  Listening and watching VOA? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1167.26s)]

*  Her 1940s stucco home is inexplicably intact. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1805.28s)]
*  Everything around you is gone. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1809.72s)]
*  Every single house. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1811.04s)]
*  I look at it and I said, why? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1812.64s)]
*  Why was my house spared? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1814.24s)]
*  I call myself one of the left behinds because I don't have the same set of issues that all [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1816.0800000000002s)]
*  of my neighbors have. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1821.56s)]
*  They're cut and dried. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1823.3200000000002s)]
*  Their properties have burned to the ground. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1824.6000000000001s)]
*  My home did not. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1826.78s)]
*  Some people would look at you and go, oh, she's one of the lucky ones. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1828.44s)]
*  But now you're dealing with what? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1831.0s)]
*  I don't feel as lucky as people think. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1833.32s)]
*  The firefighters said that this fire was like a blowtorch. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1835.72s)]
*  They've never had anything so hot before. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1838.04s)]
*  And it cooked everything inside my home at I don't know how many hundreds of degrees [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1840.36s)]
*  for I don't know how many hours. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1846.16s)]
*  How do you salvage anything from that? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1847.94s)]
*  There are 10,000 houses still standing in the burn zones. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1850.52s)]
*  The strong winds that fueled the wildfires pushed smoke and soot into those homes and [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1854.72s)]
*  left tons of toxic ash and debris at their doorsteps. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1861.72s)]
*  These are the remnants of all the synthetic stuff that makes up modern life. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1866.0s)]
*  Appliances, clothing and carpets after it all burned at high heat. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1870.04s)]
*  It's a unique component of urban fires that is complicating cleanup efforts. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1875.6s)]
*  We were with the Environmental Protection Agency as it took the first step, removing [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1881.1599999999999s)]
*  all the hazardous waste, propane tanks, cleaning supplies and paint cans, while negotiating [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1886.38s)]
*  the newest challenge, electric vehicles. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1893.5s)]
*  Chris Myers runs the EPA's lithium ion battery emergency response team. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1896.94s)]
*  He says batteries in electric vehicles can explode or ignite when damaged. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1902.5s)]
*  Uncontrolled out in the field in the public access is very, very dangerous for anyone [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1907.98s)]
*  who is on site. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1913.66s)]
*  Not just our workers but the public at large. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1914.82s)]
*  And Myers says just identifying electric vehicles after they were incinerated was a challenge. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1917.54s)]
*  It used to be fairly simple. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1923.26s)]
*  If there was not an internal combustion engine with that vehicle, it was an EV. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1925.22s)]
*  But now we have plug-in hybrids, hybrid vehicles, a tremendous amount of different platforms [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1928.82s)]
*  in which batteries are included in those vehicles. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1934.24s)]
*  I mean there's not stuff left. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1936.1799999999998s)]
*  You barely tell if it's a car or a lot of the things. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1938.1799999999998s)]
*  So the EPA conducted reconnaissance. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1941.06s)]
*  Dozens of teams fanned out across the burn zones, searching for the skeletons of electric [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1944.1s)]
*  vehicles in the debris and calling power companies and manufacturers to locate the power walls [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1949.22s)]
*  that were often attached to homes to charge them. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1955.46s)]
*  EPA teams found about 600 EVs, most of them in Lynn McIntyre's Palisades neighborhood. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1958.86s)]
*  We watched as an EPA team approached one of them. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1967.54s)]
*  A crew was instructed to stay back 75 feet. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1971.06s)]
*  Because even weeks or months after they're damaged, lithium-ion batteries can explode, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1974.82s)]
*  emit toxic gases or reignite. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1981.7s)]
*  It sounds like you're treating these batteries almost like a live grenade in the field, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1984.82s)]
*  that you don't know exactly what you're dealing with. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1990.06s)]
*  That is a way that we actually speak about damaged or insulted lithium-ion batteries. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1993.46s)]
*  Because they are delicate, they're fragile, they're unstable. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=1998.3s)]
*  Because they are unstable, extracting the batteries from one electric vehicle can take [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2001.46s)]
*  a six-person team up to two hours. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2006.5s)]
*  It's a delicate surgery performed with heavy machinery. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2009.78s)]
*  First, the top of the car is sawed off. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2013.22s)]
*  Then, an excavator flips it, exposing the battery underneath. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2017.4199999999998s)]
*  Thousands of cells that make up the battery are scooped out and placed into steel drums. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2024.78s)]
*  Those drums, up to six are needed for each car, are then transported here, to this temporary [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2031.1799999999998s)]
*  processing site, where they are plunged into a saltwater bath for three days. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2038.86s)]
*  The saltwater gives any trapped energy a place to go, so they're less likely to reignite. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2044.54s)]
*  See those bubbles? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2051.34s)]
*  That's energy releasing from the batteries. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2052.82s)]
*  The cylindrical cells are from generally the vehicles or other energy storage systems, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2055.94s)]
*  but it is the same battery from a toothbrush to a hoverboard to an e-bike to a scooter [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2062.3s)]
*  to a golf cart to a vehicle to a power wall. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2068.42s)]
*  That's a battery-powered scooter. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2072.2200000000003s)]
*  Meyer shared this simulation video to show how smaller lithium-ion batteries, when damaged [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2074.58s)]
*  or overheated, can explode and spark a fire. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2080.5s)]
*  Meyer says even batteries that don't appear damaged, such as this power wall, can be dangerous. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2085.86s)]
*  Intact batteries are typically more volatile, so they have to be brined before their cylinders [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2091.94s)]
*  are removed. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2097.1800000000003s)]
*  After a thorough soaking, the cells are scooped out, shoveled onto a steel plate, and steamrolled. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2099.7000000000003s)]
*  After you've smashed them up, then where does that waste go? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2111.14s)]
*  So that waste goes to either a recycling facility or disposal. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2117.62s)]
*  How much of the waste can be recycled? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2120.62s)]
*  Well, it's tough because there's so much damage to these batteries. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2123.2999999999997s)]
*  Oftentimes they're burned up, they're covered with ash, there's a lot of contaminants. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2127.3799999999997s)]
*  It's actually probably ejected most of what would be recoverable during recycling into [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2131.8599999999997s)]
*  the air and surrounding area. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2137.2599999999998s)]
*  So there's not a lot? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2138.58s)]
*  There's not a lot. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2139.58s)]
*  There's a lot of value still left in what we have here. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2140.66s)]
*  And what is left is technically still a hazardous material under California's strict environmental [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2143.54s)]
*  regulations. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2150.2999999999997s)]
*  But here's why that is complicated. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2151.2999999999997s)]
*  There are only two landfills in California certified to take hazardous materials, and [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2154.54s)]
*  even before the fires, they couldn't hold all of the state's hazardous waste. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2160.18s)]
*  So we wondered, where was all of this battery waste going? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2166.3s)]
*  We found the answer 600 miles away in Knowles, Utah. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2170.38s)]
*  About half of California's hazardous waste is trucked hundreds of miles away and buried [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2175.78s)]
*  in nearby states, mainly Utah and Arizona, which rely on more lenient federal waste standards. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2181.42s)]
*  Back in California, a cavalry of trucks arrived to start the second phase of the cleanup, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2189.6200000000003s)]
*  removing the rest of the debris, about nine billion pounds worth. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2194.98s)]
*  I anticipate having all fire ash and debris removed by the one year anniversary of this fire. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2200.02s)]
*  Colonel Eric Swenson is a commander for the Army Corps of Engineers. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2205.54s)]
*  It was tasked by FEMA to clear the 13,000 properties destroyed by the fires, removing [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2211.38s)]
*  everything from concrete foundations to furniture. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2217.54s)]
*  Over the 9,000 homeowners have opted for their help, and as of last week, about 900 [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2222.7s)]
*  parcels had been cleared. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2228.7799999999997s)]
*  How long does it take to do a single house? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2231.06s)]
*  So it takes anywhere from one to four days to do a standard size house. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2234.8999999999996s)]
*  If we have a house that's pinned on the side of the mountain, those properties could take [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2239.9399999999996s)]
*  us six, eight, ten days to do because we're going to need some specialized equipment to [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2244.12s)]
*  get in there. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2248.9399999999996s)]
*  All that remaining debris from burned down homes is headed to 17 landfills and recycling [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2250.54s)]
*  centers across California. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2256.58s)]
*  After the property is cleared, six inches of soil are removed in an effort to get rid [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2260.54s)]
*  of any contaminants that may have seeped into the ground. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2265.04s)]
*  In your mind, six inches is deep enough to remove the soil to make the area safe? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2269.68s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2273.98s)]
*  And I know previously in other fires, more soil has been removed. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2275.06s)]
*  Why not remove more soil now? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2279.78s)]
*  We find that it's not necessary. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2282.1400000000003s)]
*  If you over-escavate a property and continue to dig down deeper, maybe you'll find a lead [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2283.7400000000002s)]
*  pipe that was installed for drinking water 80 years ago that was never properly removed. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2288.1800000000003s)]
*  And so all we're doing is economically disadvantaging that owner because now they're going to have [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2293.5s)]
*  to replace all of that soil we excavated from that property. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2297.7400000000002s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom doesn't think removing six inches of soil is enough. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2302.5s)]
*  His office asked FEMA to test the remaining soil for toxic contaminants, as FEMA has done [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2308.34s)]
*  after previous wildfires. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2314.1800000000003s)]
*  But FEMA says the agency changed its approach to soil testing in 2020 because it found that [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2317.42s)]
*  contamination deeper than six inches was typically pre-existing and not necessary for public [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2323.2400000000002s)]
*  health protection. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2329.98s)]
*  I think it's pertinent that we test inside, outside, soil. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2331.62s)]
*  Do as much testing. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2338.1s)]
*  Get as much data as we can. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2339.14s)]
*  We need to know what we're working with. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2340.46s)]
*  Matthew Craig lived here in Altadena with his wife and son. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2342.42s)]
*  Fire destroyed the homes across the street from them. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2347.2599999999998s)]
*  But with the help of neighbors and, he says, a comically short garden hose, Craig was able [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2350.2999999999997s)]
*  to save his home. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2355.5s)]
*  But we haven't spent more than an hour in the house since the fire started. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2357.42s)]
*  Why haven't you gone back into the house for longer than an hour? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2361.46s)]
*  What's inside? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2365.42s)]
*  These houses are filled with asbestos. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2366.42s)]
*  They're filled with lead. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2368.02s)]
*  The Teslas and the EVs, those batteries were exploding. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2369.38s)]
*  They sounded like hand grenades, right? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2371.62s)]
*  So that's all in the atmosphere as well as all over the ground. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2373.86s)]
*  So there's a ton of debris and you'll see that debris all over my house. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2377.14s)]
*  And you can smell it as soon as you open the door. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2385.18s)]
*  Craig's home is frozen in time. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2388.62s)]
*  A fine film clings to everything, leaving an outline of the teddy bear he tried to salvage [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2390.66s)]
*  for his son. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2396.3399999999997s)]
*  It's so deceiving because outside the house looks like it's pristine and inside it really [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2398.14s)]
*  looks nice. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2404.7s)]
*  It's everywhere. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2405.7s)]
*  It's under your feet. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2406.7s)]
*  It's on all of this. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2407.7s)]
*  Craig's insurance company has agreed to test the inside of his home for toxins. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2409.22s)]
*  And he's waiting to hear whether they'll cover his cleanup costs. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2413.7799999999997s)]
*  If someone was to look at this and say, it's dust, right? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2417.82s)]
*  Clean it up, move on. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2421.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2422.7000000000003s)]
*  What would you say? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2423.7000000000003s)]
*  The house is filled with the ashes of thousands of homes that are hundreds of years old. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2424.7000000000003s)]
*  It's not just dust. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2429.3s)]
*  It's a hundred thousand gallons of pesticides. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2431.1400000000003s)]
*  It's a million gallons of lead paint. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2434.3s)]
*  It's a million pounds of insulation. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2436.98s)]
*  Back in the Palisades, Lynn McIntyre has theories about why her house was somehow spared in [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2440.42s)]
*  the fires. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2445.9s)]
*  But what she is desperate for now are some definitive answers. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2447.34s)]
*  What are you being told about the safety of your air, of your soil, of the inside of your [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2451.98s)]
*  home? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2458.38s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2459.38s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2460.38s)]
*  There's no guidelines for moving back. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2461.38s)]
*  There's no guidelines for what you should be looking for. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2463.6600000000003s)]
*  There's no guidelines telling you who to call or regulate. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2466.02s)]
*  Testing is like, it's a wild west out there with the testing, with the remediation companies. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2470.3s)]
*  People are just grasping at straws with no guidance from government. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2475.42s)]
*  So she decided to pay $5,000 out of pocket to have her home tested for toxins. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2479.1s)]
*  The tests revealed arsenic in her home and lead levels 22 times higher than what the [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2485.82s)]
*  EPA considers safe. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2491.5s)]
*  Her insurance company says it will not cover the cost of cleaning it all up because it [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2494.1s)]
*  says it does not constitute, quote, a direct physical loss. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2499.3s)]
*  Anne McIntyre signed an 18-month lease on an apartment out of town, anticipating the [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2504.34s)]
*  road home for her and her neighbors will be a long one. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2509.78s)]
*  Now, the last minute of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2522.02s)]
*  Next week on 60 Minutes, we'll explore the fascinating life of the whiskey barrel, an [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2526.82s)]
*  ancient product that still plays a vital role in global commerce. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2532.26s)]
*  Millions of new oak barrels are built in America every year, fired up and then filled with [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2538.5s)]
*  what will become bourbon through years of aging as the wood delivers magic to the whiskey. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2544.7400000000002s)]
*  Smell that, smell that. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2552.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2554.5s)]
*  That does smell delicious. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2555.5s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2556.5s)]
*  It really does. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2557.5s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2558.5s)]
*  There's a reason why people still use oak barrels 2000 years later. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2559.74s)]
*  So when I'm sipping the bourbon, I'm sipping this barrel. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2564.94s)]
*  That's right. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2569.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2570.5s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2571.5s)]
*  That story and more next week on another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBfokjonOiQ&t=2573.82s)]
