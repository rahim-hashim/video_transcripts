# Historic Documents | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [January 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M)
*  The National Archives has been in the news lately, not so much for what is in its collection, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=0.0s)]
*  but for what was missing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  After former President Donald Trump and then Vice President Biden held onto records when [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  they left office that should have been sent to the Archives, we wanted to know more about [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=26.26s)]
*  the small federal agency in charge of safeguarding America's past. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=31.62s)]
*  After a few months inside, we came to appreciate that the Archives are the country's safety [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=37.14s)]
*  deposit box, reading room, and paper shredder rolled into one. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=42.22s)]
*  At the heart of the institution are the documents that have been at the heart of the nation [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=47.7s)]
*  for nearly 250 years. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=53.1s)]
*  There's 39 steps here that lead up to the entrance, and that's 39 framers to sign the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=58.300000000000004s)]
*  Constitution. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=63.7s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=64.7s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=65.7s)]
*  Colleen Shogan, the archivist of the United States, is responsible for America's records. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=66.7s)]
*  The main attractions are in a building in Washington that was inspired by ancient Rome [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=76.26s)]
*  and built to be a temple to history. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=81.82s)]
*  Each year, more than a million people make the trip to see these national treasures in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=86.1s)]
*  person. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=90.82s)]
*  This building, the Rotunda, was built as a shrine for many of these documents, but they [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=91.89999999999999s)]
*  didn't arrive until later. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=96.22s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  The building was completed in 1937, but the Declaration and the Constitution did not arrive [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=99.25999999999999s)]
*  until 1952. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  They were in the possession of the Library of Congress, which refused to turn them over [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=106.13999999999999s)]
*  until President Truman got involved, and they were delivered from Capitol Hill by the U.S. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=111.5s)]
*  military. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=116.58s)]
*  They will be protected from disaster and from the ravages of time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=117.58s)]
*  Ah, the Declaration of Independence. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=123.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=126.5s)]
*  Why is it so faded? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=127.5s)]
*  It was exposed to considerable light in the elements. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=129.34s)]
*  In the 19th century, the U.S. Patent Office put the Declaration on display near a window. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=132.5s)]
*  That and other missteps did so much damage, nearly all you can make out today is John [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=138.98s)]
*  Hancock's John Hancock. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=144.98s)]
*  To preserve them, these original documents that are a beacon for democracy are now intentionally [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=148.33999999999997s)]
*  kept in the dark. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=153.7s)]
*  They are guarded around the clock in bulletproof cases designed to remain sealed for 100 years. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=155.29999999999998s)]
*  Several federal employees are required to take an oath to defend the Constitution. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=166.7s)]
*  But for Colleen Shogan, it's literally her job, and the founding documents are just the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=171.6s)]
*  start. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=177.94s)]
*  We have approximately 13.5 billion paper records here at the National Archives. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=178.94s)]
*  How many feet of film? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=185.73999999999998s)]
*  Oh, the film would go around the globe three and a half times. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=186.73999999999998s)]
*  How many photographs? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=191.98s)]
*  We have millions and millions of photographs as well. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=194.14s)]
*  And how many artifacts? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=197.77999999999997s)]
*  Over 700,000 artifacts. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=199.5s)]
*  Most of that massive collection is kept outside of Washington, stored at dozens of facilities [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=205.14s)]
*  all across the country that span millions of cubic feet, including four underground [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=211.14s)]
*  cave complexes in the Midwest. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=217.17999999999998s)]
*  For our civilian record center in Valmeyer, Illinois, our archivists actually use bikes [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=219.96s)]
*  because it's about a mile from one end of the facility to the other. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=225.12s)]
*  Then there's the stuff they don't even keep. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=230.44s)]
*  Only about 3 percent of government paperwork is deemed important enough to preserve for [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  posterity. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=238.0s)]
*  Documents can sit for years before being retained or more likely destroyed. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  At the Washington National Records Center outside D.C., there are 20 football fields [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=245.0s)]
*  of files stacked floor to ceiling, awaiting their fate. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=250.64s)]
*  Until 1934, federal agencies stored their own records, with varying degrees of success. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  When the archives was created, work began to restore 158 years' worth of dusty, forgotten [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=263.09999999999997s)]
*  documents. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  To see how some of America's oldest paper records have held up, we met Trevor Plant, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=272.4s)]
*  who's in charge of more than two billion written documents in Washington. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=278.2s)]
*  So this is original from 1778? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=282.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=285.12s)]
*  During the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress wanted George Washington and his [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=286.12s)]
*  officers to pledge allegiance in writing to their new nation after they survived a brutal [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=291.44s)]
*  winter at Valley Forge. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=296.96s)]
*  So the irony is that the Army can barely afford to feed them, clothe them, house them, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=299.14s)]
*  supply them with arms and ammunition, but they're like, here's all this paperwork. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=304.02s)]
*  We want it filled out and returned. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=306.9s)]
*  And so that is George Washington's handwriting and signature? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=308.82s)]
*  Correct, yep, yep. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=311.94s)]
*  And then here? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=313.7s)]
*  This officer became very popular a couple years ago, Alexander Hamilton. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  We don't often think of him as Alex Hamilton, but he had signed his name Alex Hamilton on [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=318.82s)]
*  his oath. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=322.9s)]
*  Trevor Plant has a theory about why one of his favorite documents looks so unique. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=325.86s)]
*  This is a resolution passed by Congress in early 1865. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=331.54s)]
*  Once it was ratified, it became the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=337.06s)]
*  And if you notice on here, there's several different handwritings for the 13th Amendment. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=341.3s)]
*  So we speculate that these clerks realized what a big deal this was at the time and literally [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=347.42s)]
*  wanted to have a hand in history. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=352.14s)]
*  Does the 13th Amendment abolish slavery? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=354.18s)]
*  Abolish slavery in the United States, exactly. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=355.94s)]
*  Plant likes to say archives keeps the nation's receipts, and he means it, like the treaty [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=358.46s)]
*  for the Louisiana Purchase. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=364.82s)]
*  It was four cents an acre, which was a pretty good deal since we doubled the size of the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=366.34000000000003s)]
*  United States. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=371.26s)]
*  Signed by Napoleon Bonaparte himself. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=373.02s)]
*  There's also the Deed of Gift that came with the Statue of Liberty from France in 1884. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=376.3s)]
*  Two years later, it'll be installed in New York Harbor. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=382.88s)]
*  And the check Russia cashed when the U.S. bought Alaska in 1867 for $7.2 million. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=386.12s)]
*  Came back to the government as a canceled check. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=394.04s)]
*  In 1988, after Archives' main building in Washington ran out of room, Congress funded [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=396.76s)]
*  the construction of a state-of-the-art facility in College Park, Maryland. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=402.64s)]
*  From there, deputy archivist Jay Bosenko runs day-to-day operations. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=407.36s)]
*  So here in the vault we have... [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=412.28s)]
*  He invited us into their most restricted vault, where cameras usually aren't allowed, to see [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=413.96s)]
*  relics of a dark chapter in world history, Hitler's last will and testament and Ava Braun's [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=420.0s)]
*  diary. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=427.4s)]
*  This happens to be from 1935. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=428.67999999999995s)]
*  How is it that the U.S. government got its hands on Hitler's mistress's diary? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  So this was quite literally sort of the spoils of war. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=436.52s)]
*  This was captured by U.S. armed forces, then transferred to us at the National Archives. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=440.08s)]
*  Some of the items inside this vault only became historically significant with age, like this [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=446.32s)]
*  letter from a young Fidel Castro to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  So there may be treasures like this buried in boxes in lots of places. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=458.4s)]
*  Yet to be discovered. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=463.03999999999996s)]
*  You never know when you're opening a box what you might find next. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=464.4s)]
*  Or who might be opening it? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=468.68s)]
*  Researchers, writers and history buffs from around the country and the world come to the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=470.92s)]
*  archives to make discoveries. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=476.32s)]
*  We saw a group from Japan cataloging the American occupation that followed World War II. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=478.76s)]
*  And a U.S. Army unit on a special mission, combing through a million old army files looking [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=486.04s)]
*  for black and Native American soldiers who were once overlooked but might now be awarded [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=492.0s)]
*  the Medal of Honor. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=498.32s)]
*  The records that we hold need to be made available. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=500.0s)]
*  We need to bring the stories that are captured in those records alive. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=503.72s)]
*  There's a record here at College Park that I want to show you and our viewers. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=508.28000000000003s)]
*  This is the resignation letter of Richard Nixon, August 9th, 1974. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=514.12s)]
*  This is an incredibly important document. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=522.28s)]
*  I had no prior knowledge of the Watergate break-in. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=525.12s)]
*  Before the Watergate scandal, records belonged to the presidents who created them. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=529.44s)]
*  But after President Nixon sought to destroy audio tapes with evidence of potential crimes, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=535.04s)]
*  Congress took action. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=540.8s)]

*  They control what the American people can know or not know about their presidency. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=549.54s)]
*  When did individual presidents stop owning the records that they created? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=556.3s)]
*  Not until 1978 when the Presidential Records Act was signed. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=562.42s)]
*  It was starting with President Reagan. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=566.8199999999999s)]
*  Now the records of a presidency belong to the American people and not to the president. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=569.42s)]
*  In 2021, former President Trump tested that law when he took dozens of boxes, including [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=575.14s)]
*  almost 340 documents bearing classification markings to his home in Florida. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=581.28s)]
*  Mr. Trump was eventually charged with 40 felonies, including for allegedly refusing to turn over [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=587.8199999999999s)]
*  some of the papers. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=593.98s)]
*  The case was dismissed, but the Justice Department is appealing. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=596.08s)]
*  Joe Biden was also investigated over more than 80 documents with classification markings [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=600.74s)]
*  that he had from when he was vice president and a senator. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=606.54s)]
*  Mr. Biden cooperated with the investigation and was not charged. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=610.78s)]
*  Jay Bosenko told us the archives is simply the custodian of the documents all presidents [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=615.54s)]
*  are required to turn over. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=621.14s)]
*  Enforcing the law is up to the Justice Department. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=623.3s)]
*  What is potentially lost when presidential records are not transferred to the National Archives? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=626.94s)]
*  That strikes at the very heart of the historical record, the completeness of it, the ability [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=632.58s)]
*  to understand decisions. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=638.9000000000001s)]
*  And so it's important for historians and ultimately the American people to understand [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=641.58s)]
*  all of the pieces that came in and made up that decision-making. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=646.74s)]
*  Those pieces of history start to become available to reporters and scholars five years after [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=650.7800000000001s)]
*  a presidency ends, at the 15 presidential libraries in the archives system. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=656.58s)]
*  When that five-year window hits, almost immediately we have a backlog of thousands of FOIA requests [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=663.26s)]
*  that we can't possibly respond to within the 10 days under the Freedom of Information Act. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=669.34s)]
*  When Colleen Shogan became archivist last year, she inherited a flat budget and a mountain [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=676.1s)]

*  That's because of the extreme interest in those records. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=694.18s)]
*  And I think the way that we are going to make headway on this in the near future is going [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=698.8199999999999s)]

*  resources have put it at serious risk of mission failure. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=723.26s)]

*  writings, even the first references to Jesus. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=837.5s)]
*  The problem is the volcanic heat left the scrolls so charred and brittle, no one has [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=841.1s)]

*  They're simply trying to take shelter under these vaults. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=925.0600000000001s)]
*  Vesuvius blasted the town with successive massive surges of heat and ash for 24 hours. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=928.66s)]

*  And then wave after wave, they begin to build up these layers of ash that compacts into [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=940.98s)]
*  rock. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=948.54s)]

*  That was the thinking. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1130.06s)]
*  Didn't think it was that far-fetched. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1131.06s)]
*  No. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1133.06s)]
*  In the arcane world where academics spend their entire careers poring over fragments [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1134.06s)]
*  of ancient texts, Brent Seals is a superstar. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1139.74s)]
*  He made his name digitally restoring damaged medieval manuscripts with software he had [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1144.3s)]
*  designed. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1150.78s)]
*  A colleague told him about the scrolls of Herculaneum, most housed at the Library of [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1152.46s)]
*  Naples, a few others in France and England. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1156.54s)]
*  He considered them the ultimate challenge. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1160.3s)]
*  The people are gone, the cultures are gone, the places are gone, and yet, like a time [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1163.94s)]
*  capsule, you have this item that tells a story. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1168.02s)]
*  All locked away in that thing that looks like a little lump of charcoal. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1172.1399999999999s)]
*  They're all locked away. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1175.82s)]
*  He knew imaging technology could only reveal a jumble of letters like this. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1177.34s)]
*  To actually read the scrolls, he'd have to unroll them, much like this medieval French [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1183.26s)]
*  scroll at the Morgan Library in Manhattan. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1189.4599999999998s)]
*  But he'd have to do this virtually. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1193.22s)]
*  After years of trial and error, he and his students thought they'd crack the code with [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1196.9399999999998s)]
*  algorithms and software. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1201.6999999999998s)]
*  He was cocky enough to announce at Oxford to an international conference of scholars [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1204.08s)]
*  who study ancient papyrus that he could do what no one else had done. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1208.84s)]
*  I swung for the fence. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1214.32s)]
*  I gave him a talk where I said, I think we can read everything inside the Herculaneum [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1216.36s)]
*  scrolls without opening them. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1221.52s)]
*  Did you think the pepirologists would come running to you with their scrolls and say, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1223.52s)]
*  here, here, take a look at these? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1227.84s)]
*  I smile now because that is exactly what I thought. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1229.72s)]
*  Didn't happen. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1232.56s)]
*  So how hard is it to get your hands on these scrolls? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1234.04s)]
*  I would say somewhere in the vicinity of nigh near impossible. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1238.48s)]
*  That's because they're so rare and so fragile, curators are reluctant to let anyone handle [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1243.72s)]
*  them, including a superstar like Brent Seals. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1249.3999999999999s)]
*  They wouldn't relent even after he published a paper theorizing a better way to peer inside [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1253.4199999999998s)]
*  the scrolls with this, a synchrotron, a super powerful X-ray generated by electrons racing [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1259.8200000000002s)]
*  around this ring at almost the speed of light. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1266.98s)]
*  There are only about 50 in the world. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1270.38s)]
*  This one is in Britain. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1273.14s)]
*  The X-ray is this green beam, 100 billion times stronger than any hospital X-ray. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1276.3s)]
*  Maybe it's coincidence, but shortly after Seals published his pioneering paper, just [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1284.3s)]
*  to give you an idea, two Italian scholars stepped forward and claimed they had had the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1290.1s)]
*  same idea to use a synchrotron. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1295.78s)]
*  Vito Macchella, a physicist from Naples, says he first learned about the scrolls as a child. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1298.8999999999999s)]
*  I cannot remember exactly the age, but nine, ten. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1305.02s)]
*  And Graziano Rinocchia, a papyrologist, he studies ancient Roman papyrus. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1309.1599999999999s)]
*  He pours over bits of herculaneum scrolls at the Naples Library. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1314.84s)]
*  Most are fragments of Greek philosophy. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1319.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm coming here and working on this papyri every day. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1322.72s)]
*  Call it academic competition, call it ego, but American Brent Seals, Rinocchia, the papyrologist, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1326.56s)]
*  and Italian physicist Macchella became fierce competitors, all fighting to make history [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1333.96s)]
*  as the first to reveal the contents of the scrolls, a gladiatorial wrestling match in [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1340.6s)]
*  the hallowed halls of the ivory tower. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1346.48s)]
*  Rinocchia accuses Macchella of sabotaging his research. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1349.56s)]
*  Seals is convinced the Italians poached his idea to use the synchrotron. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1354.44s)]
*  The mystery of the scrolls is playing out like some tragic Italian opera. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1359.34s)]
*  You know they say, Bill, that the reason academics argue is because the stakes are so low, right? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1364.82s)]
*  The stakes actually are really high. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1371.26s)]
*  If you think about the possibility of revealing these manuscripts to the world from two thousand [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1372.9399999999998s)]
*  years ago that no one's ever read. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1378.8999999999999s)]
*  And okay, so now we're going to argue with each other? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1382.86s)]
*  Really? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1385.86s)]
*  Maybe we could do that later after we've read them. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1387.06s)]
*  But the two Italian rivals use their European connections and convince curators to let each [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1390.4599999999998s)]
*  of them and only them have limited access to a few scrolls to scan with the synchrotron. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1396.3999999999999s)]
*  They leapfrogged over American Brent Seals and raced to this one in Grenoble, France. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1403.3799999999999s)]
*  Macchella got there first. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1409.26s)]
*  It was hard for us to make out, but he said his scan revealed letters. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1412.54s)]
*  These are letters? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1418.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1419.22s)]
*  These are letters. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1420.22s)]
*  Yes, he said. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1421.22s)]
*  These are letters. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1423.22s)]
*  Macchella won international praise and headlines as the first person to see inside one of the [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1424.6599999999999s)]
*  ancient scrolls of Herculaneum. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1431.22s)]
*  When papirologist Ranocchia scanned his scrolls, he said he did Macchella one better. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1434.1s)]
*  Has anyone else found anything as clear as this? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1440.58s)]
*  Nothing like this. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1445.62s)]
*  He said he saw phrases. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1447.1399999999999s)]
*  Pace, theia, namely they would be persuaded. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1449.62s)]
*  This is how. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1452.22s)]
*  Would be persuaded. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1453.22s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1454.22s)]
*  Brent Seals is not persuaded. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1455.22s)]
*  You don't believe that? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1458.06s)]
*  Hey, I engage in wishful thinking all the time. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1459.06s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I'm a scientist, and wishful thinking is not what science is [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1463.1s)]
*  based on. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1468.6999999999998s)]
*  I was unable to replicate their results, and so far I've not heard from anyone who's been [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1469.82s)]
*  able to replicate them. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1475.62s)]
*  But with their findings published in scientific journals, the Italian scholars savored their [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1477.34s)]
*  achievements. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1482.54s)]
*  Macchella considers Brent Seals' criticism sour grapes. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1483.82s)]
*  Brent Seals looked at your latest findings and he says he doesn't see any letters. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1488.34s)]
*  I know. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1495.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1496.1399999999999s)]
*  You don't know why? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1497.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1498.1399999999999s)]
*  I guess my threshold is somewhat different. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1499.22s)]
*  When I see writing, you know, it should line up. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1501.3s)]
*  It should be more than a letter or two. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1503.66s)]
*  You ought to be able to see text that looks like something you can actually read. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1505.14s)]
*  Since he couldn't get access to the Herculaneum scrolls, Seals looked elsewhere to prove his [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1509.54s)]
*  algorithms and software. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1515.38s)]
*  That led him to Jerusalem and this charred fragment, a 1700 year old scroll from a burned [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1518.6200000000001s)]
*  synagogue near the Dead Sea. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1526.26s)]
*  Is there a line up here? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1528.54s)]
*  Israeli archaeologists didn't expect much, but what Seals' software revealed was like [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1530.02s)]
*  a miracle. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1535.98s)]
*  What was it? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1536.98s)]
*  Well, it was the Bible. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1537.98s)]
*  He resurrected all the surviving Hebrew script, the oldest text of the Bible as we know it [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1540.0s)]
*  today. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1545.98s)]
*  The first two chapters of Leviticus in a scroll that prior to that was assumed to be nothing [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1547.3s)]
*  or so badly damaged, no one would ever know. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1553.06s)]
*  This is what you would hope to see in the Herculaneum scrolls? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1556.26s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1560.54s)]
*  I mean, this is actually an identifiable text. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1561.54s)]
*  Following his breakthrough in Jerusalem, even Graziano Renocchia admits Brent Seals' software [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1565.34s)]
*  is brilliant. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1571.2s)]
*  Now, the Naples Library, which wouldn't let Seals get his hands on the scrolls, is considering [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1572.5s)]
*  granting him access. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1578.46s)]
*  He is convinced the secrets of Herculaneum, locked away in the scrolls for 2000 years, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1580.72s)]
*  are just within reach. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1587.08s)]
*  In 1492, Christopher Columbus, of course, sailed the ocean blue. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1600.52s)]
*  And on his journey home, he wrote a letter to his patrons, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1605.46s)]
*  of Spain, describing his discovery of the New World and, in effect, asking for more [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1610.28s)]
*  money to make another trip. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1615.16s)]
*  Columbus' voyage marked one of the great plot points in history. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1617.76s)]
*  Upon his return, his letter was printed and distributed throughout Europe, making for [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1621.52s)]
*  blockbuster news. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1625.62s)]
*  Columbus' original handwritten letter, penned on the high seas, no longer exists. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1627.92s)]
*  But some of the printed copies do. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1632.68s)]
*  As we first reported last year, most are housed in prestigious libraries, and for centuries [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1634.98s)]
*  that's where they've remained. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1639.72s)]
*  That is until about 10 years ago, when authorities discovered some of these treasures had been [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1641.88s)]
*  stolen and replaced with forgeries. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1646.08s)]
*  So began a modern kind of transatlantic quest, as investigators in the U.S. and Europe worked [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1648.9s)]
*  to recover Columbus' missing missives and solve this most unusual international mystery. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1654.72s)]
*  If there is one library in the world you'd think would be impervious to theft, this would [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1662.64s)]
*  be it. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1667.34s)]
*  The Vatican Library in Rome houses a vast and unrivaled collection of historic treasures. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1668.5s)]
*  It is the Pope's Library, home to manuscripts going back nearly 2,000 years. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1674.5s)]
*  The Library is closed to the public, it's a place for scholars only. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1680.14s)]
*  But Ambroggio Piazzoni, the vice-prefect, invited us inside. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1684.9s)]
*  It was here in 2011 that Vatican officials first discovered that one of their prized [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1689.72s)]
*  items, a Columbus letter, had somehow been stolen and replaced with a fake. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1694.7s)]
*  How do you think this happened? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1700.9s)]
*  Look, I do not know. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1702.7s)]
*  I have no idea how and when it may have happened. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1706.18s)]
*  Certainly it was an operation carried out as a proper theft. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1709.3600000000001s)]
*  But I do not know when or how. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1712.82s)]
*  He's in good company. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1715.22s)]
*  At the center of this mystery, this eight-page letter, written at sea by Christopher Columbus [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1717.18s)]
*  more than 500 years ago. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1722.28s)]
*  In it, he describes his first impressions of the New World, a wonderland, he writes, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1724.82s)]
*  filled with rivers, gold and timid natives. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1730.08s)]
*  When Columbus's letter arrived at the Royal Court in Spain in 1493, it was promptly sent [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1734.18s)]
*  to Rome, where it was translated into Latin and printed, spreading the news of his extraordinary [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1739.8799999999999s)]
*  expedition. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1746.44s)]
*  So this was big news. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1747.44s)]
*  Columbus makes his voyage and suddenly this is being disseminated. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1748.8799999999999s)]
*  This is some of the biggest news ever. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1752.1599999999999s)]
*  Jay Dillon is a rare book dealer in New Jersey. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1754.32s)]
*  He ranks the Columbus letter as one of the most important documents ever printed. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1757.08s)]
*  This was one of the first bestsellers. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1761.84s)]
*  It's probably the first contemporary account of anything to be published across Europe. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1763.9199999999998s)]
*  Today, only about 30 copies of this Columbus letter still exist. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1769.08s)]
*  Each one is now worth something in the low seven figures. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1773.6s)]
*  More than a million dollars. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1776.6s)]
*  More than a million, but probably less than four or five million. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1777.6s)]
*  It was while researching Columbus letters on his home computer back in 2011 that Jay [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1780.4s)]
*  Dillon first noticed something amiss. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1785.5600000000002s)]
*  The National Library of Catalonia in Barcelona had posted photos of their Columbus letter [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1788.52s)]
*  online. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1793.8400000000001s)]
*  What struck Dillon as odd? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1795.2s)]
*  It looked exactly like a Columbus letter that he had seen for sale a year earlier, right [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1796.88s)]
*  down to the same smudge marks in the margins. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1802.24s)]
*  You're telling yourself what at this point? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1805.64s)]
*  I'm telling myself that one of them has to be a forgery. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1807.4s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1810.16s)]
*  Because you can't have two books with the same random brown spots in the margins. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1811.44s)]
*  It's just impossible. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1816.48s)]
*  What confirmed your suspicions were these matching marks from these texts that were [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1817.88s)]
*  500 years old. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1821.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1823.16s)]
*  That would not happen. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1824.16s)]
*  That cannot happen. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1825.2s)]
*  Jay suspected the library's letter had been stolen and put up for sale, which meant whatever [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1826.48s)]
*  was currently in their collection was a fake. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1831.92s)]
*  It was so remarkable I couldn't believe it at first. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1835.08s)]
*  And I made it my business from that moment on to look at every original I could. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1837.8s)]
*  And so it was that Jay Dillon became an unlikely detective. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1842.8799999999999s)]
*  Following his instincts, he visited libraries in Rome and Florence and took a look at their [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1847.84s)]
*  Columbus letters. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1852.8s)]
*  To my utter astonishment, a Columbus letter in the Vatican Library was a forgery. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1854.3799999999999s)]
*  And then I went to the Biblioteca Riccardiana in Florence and damned if the same thing doesn't [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1860.32s)]
*  happen again. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1866.74s)]
*  Their Columbus letters are fake too. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1868.6399999999999s)]
*  Afraid that notifying the libraries might alert the culprit, he decided instead to take [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1870.72s)]
*  his information to the Department of Justice. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1875.72s)]
*  It seemed like it was almost out of a Hollywood movie script. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1878.1599999999999s)]
*  Homeland Security Special Agent Mark Alexa led the investigation, along with Assistant [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1882.12s)]
*  for the District of Delaware, Jamie McCall. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1887.68s)]
*  Similar reaction, I thought it was a John Grisham novel, that we had some people in [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1890.6000000000001s)]
*  Europe stealing these treasures of the world and replacing them with high quality forgeries. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1895.28s)]
*  You say Hollywood script, you say John Grisham. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1903.28s)]
*  Were you skeptical? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1905.48s)]
*  Of course. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1907.46s)]
*  We have to confirm what our tipster was providing us. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1908.46s)]
*  They turn to Paul Needham, one of the world's foremost experts on 15th century printing. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1913.0s)]
*  He runs the Scheide Library at Princeton University, home to one of the most valuable private collections [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1918.64s)]
*  of books on earth. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1924.4s)]
*  And now it was Needham's turn to travel to Europe to examine the letters. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1926.6s)]
*  In each case, he determined the originals had indeed been removed and replaced with [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1931.12s)]
*  photographic facsimiles printed on centuries old paper. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1935.6s)]
*  The Columbus letter being a highly collected book, it's just the perfect combination, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1939.6s)]
*  both very small and very valuable. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1946.04s)]
*  Their value per leaf of paper is higher than for any other printed book. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1949.6s)]
*  You're saying this is the perfect item to forge. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1956.3999999999999s)]
*  It's the perfect item to forge. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1958.84s)]
*  And there's a market for it. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1960.4399999999998s)]
*  There's always been a market for it. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1961.52s)]
*  This turned into a transatlantic collaboration, a legacy, you might say, of Christopher Columbus. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1963.54s)]
*  We engaged quickly with the Carabinieri. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1969.58s)]
*  Enter Giovanni Prisco, captain of the Carabinieri Police's Cultural Heritage Squad based in [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1972.58s)]
*  Rome. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1978.82s)]

*  In Italy, it is a crime market second only to that of illegal drug and weapon sales. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1985.52s)]
*  We're in this country with so many artifacts, with so many churches. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1990.78s)]
*  You must be very busy. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=1995.8s)]

*  It was from a private house. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2037.58s)]

*  What does a Caravaggio go for these days? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2043.02s)]
*  It's a million of dollars, of course. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2044.82s)]

*  Why is it so difficult to protect books from theft? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2080.58s)]
*  Because books, some of them are really small. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2084.06s)]

*  Familiar name to you guys? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2117.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2119.02s)]
*  Massimo De Caro was prosecuted by the Italian authorities for pilfering thousands of rare [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2120.02s)]
*  books and he was involved in the sale of at least one of the Columbus Letters at issue. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2127.74s)]
*  This is someone who's been involved in these kinds of crimes before. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2133.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes, correct. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2136.2599999999998s)]
*  Fair to characterize him as a person of interest? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2137.2599999999998s)]
*  He is a subject in the investigation. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2139.82s)]
*  The Columbus Letters themselves may be hard to track down, but this subject in the investigation [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2143.3s)]
*  is not exactly in hiding. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2148.54s)]
*  Massimo De Caro, a notorious Italian book thief, just finished serving a seven-year [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2151.06s)]
*  sentence for stealing thousands of ancient books and manuscripts from Italian libraries [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2156.2000000000003s)]
*  and selling them overseas. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2161.38s)]
*  To our surprise, he agreed to meet with us at his home in Orvieto, a hill town an hour's [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2163.54s)]
*  drive north of Rome. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2168.58s)]
*  To say that he professes his innocence would be an act of considerable understatement. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2169.94s)]
*  The police say you're a subject in this investigation. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2175.2999999999997s)]
*  Does that concern you? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2178.5s)]
*  You know, first of all, the police in Italy regarding books are the worst, okay? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2179.94s)]
*  They even don't know how is made one book. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2185.7s)]
*  I love Italy too much to say which level they are, okay? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2188.2599999999998s)]
*  But that doesn't bother you that you're a person of interest? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2191.2999999999997s)]
*  No, no. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2193.58s)]
*  I mean, I would like to help. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2194.58s)]
*  You want to help? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2195.58s)]
*  Yeah, I would like to help. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2196.98s)]
*  If I work on it, I'm sure I can solve it. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2197.98s)]
*  You think you're smarter than the police? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2201.34s)]
*  Let's say that I'm more expert than them. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2204.2599999999998s)]
*  In this field? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2206.74s)]
*  In this field, yes. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2207.74s)]
*  De Caro is not just a convicted thief, he's also an accomplished forger. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2208.74s)]
*  He spent years making a fake Galileo book, which fooled the experts and sold for almost [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2214.22s)]
*  a half million dollars. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2219.18s)]
*  He showed us another Galileo reproduction he made. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2221.14s)]
*  You can see the quality of the paper. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2224.22s)]
*  I used antique paper. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2226.4199999999996s)]
*  You did this? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2228.58s)]
*  This is your handiwork? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2229.58s)]
*  Yes, at all. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2230.58s)]
*  I'm very proud about this. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2231.58s)]
*  You're very proud of this? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2232.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2233.8199999999997s)]
*  If this book were original, what would this fetch on the market? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2234.8199999999997s)]
*  What would someone pay for this? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2238.4599999999996s)]
*  $300,000, at least. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2240.22s)]
*  De Caro admits he sold two Columbus letters, which he says he bought legitimately from [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2242.62s)]
*  an anonymous collector. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2248.14s)]
*  But he denies he ever made a fake Columbus letter. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2249.98s)]
*  For one thing, he says, it's too easy. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2254.1800000000003s)]
*  You could have reproduced one of these Columbus letters. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2257.1000000000004s)]
*  Oh, if I try, I'm sure I can create the best Columbus letter. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2259.0600000000004s)]
*  If I create a Columbus letter, then we can show this Columbus letter to all the experts [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2264.3s)]
*  that you want, and I'm sure I can bet that nobody recognized it as a fake. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2268.2200000000003s)]
*  You think you could fool them? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2273.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2274.6600000000003s)]
*  Eight years into the joint U.S.-Italian investigation, no arrests have been made in the case. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2275.6600000000003s)]
*  The three stolen Columbus letters have been recovered. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2281.02s)]
*  No easy task as they were sold in private sales to wealthy collectors, who, investigators [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2284.34s)]
*  say, weren't aware the letters had been stolen. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2289.7s)]
*  How did you start tracking down the originals? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2292.7s)]
*  We relied heavily on Dr. Needham. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2294.9s)]
*  He had a great roadmap of transactions and who was possessing and selling these Columbus [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2297.78s)]
*  letters throughout the world. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2303.06s)]
*  They were found in the most surprising places. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2304.88s)]
*  The letters stolen from the Riccardiana Library in Florence turned up in, get this, the U.S. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2307.58s)]
*  Library of Congress, alongside national treasures like the Declaration of Independence and the [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2313.14s)]
*  Constitution. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2318.2599999999998s)]
*  They were shocked. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2319.54s)]
*  They were stunned, as you can imagine. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2320.54s)]
*  The letter had been donated to the Library of Congress in 2004 by one of their major [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2322.18s)]
*  donors. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2327.7s)]
*  As for the Vatican's stolen Columbus letter, it was traced to a wealthy Atlanta collector [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2329.7999999999997s)]
*  who had bought it in 2004 for almost $1 million. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2335.02s)]
*  Last year, Ambrosio Piazzoni, vice-prefect of the Vatican Library, was on hand when it [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2339.7s)]
*  was returned to its rightful home. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2345.14s)]
*  When the Columbus letter was returned to the Vatican, was the pope informed about that? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2347.82s)]
*  Yes, he was informed. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2352.18s)]
*  He was very pleased with this return. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2354.7s)]
*  When you're seeing the successful return of the stolen Vatican Library document, is that [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2357.02s)]
*  a miracle? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2362.02s)]
*  I use the word miracle for other things. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2364.02s)]
*  But let's say that this was a very beautiful thing and we're happy that it happened. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2368.14s)]
*  For Jay Dillon, the rare book dealer who stumbled upon the first clue in this mystery, it's [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2373.06s)]
*  been a satisfying quest about more than simply stolen letters. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2377.78s)]
*  This is the very stuff of history. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2382.66s)]
*  Columbus, for all his achievements and all his faults, did something that nobody had [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2385.14s)]
*  ever done before. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2389.66s)]
*  He actually made the globe a globe. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2391.1s)]
*  And that's pretty much the most consequential news ever published, isn't it? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2393.74s)]
*  After our story aired, investigators recovered a fourth stolen Columbus letter, which had [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2399.5s)]
*  been missing for more than 30 years. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2403.7799999999997s)]
*  It was found in the hands of an unidentified private collector and returned to the National [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2406.2799999999997s)]
*  Library in Venice. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2410.7799999999997s)]
*  We're about to visit a place few people have seen firsthand, the Vatican Library, a vast [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2421.58s)]
*  collection of historic treasures beyond compare. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2427.62s)]
*  Founded over five centuries ago when Europe was coming out of the Dark Ages, a period [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2431.62s)]
*  of so-called humanism, when the Catholic Church was open to new ideas in philosophy, science, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2436.94s)]
*  and the human spirit. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2443.18s)]
*  It's the Pope's library, but it contains much more than just church documents. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2445.18s)]
*  There are manuscripts going back nearly 2,000 years on music and math, warfare and exploration, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2450.38s)]
*  even cookbooks and love letters. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2456.86s)]
*  The library is closed to the public, a place for scholars only. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2459.6600000000003s)]
*  But the Vatican agreed to let us in to see some of the priceless artifacts of our collective [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2463.54s)]
*  past. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2469.7400000000002s)]
*  Welcome to the 15th century. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2476.7400000000002s)]
*  In Rome, turn a corner and you bump into antiquity, a delicious mixed salad of present and past. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2479.26s)]
*  We arrived at the Vatican to find a medieval costume parade in progress. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2487.26s)]
*  What better way to begin a trek through history? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2492.1800000000003s)]
*  There's about two million printed books. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2496.46s)]
*  Two million printed books. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2498.5800000000004s)]
*  And inside the library, the past surrounded us again, as we were shown the magnificent [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2500.5s)]
*  building and its riches. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2506.22s)]
*  This is the Urbino Bible. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2509.54s)]
*  For instance, this spectacular Bible commissioned in 1476 by the Duke of Urbino. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2511.3199999999997s)]
*  He wanted to have a very fancy Bible. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2516.98s)]
*  And this is what he got. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2520.7799999999997s)]
*  Library curator Timothy Janz tells us the Bible took years to make by hand, letter by [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2523.4599999999996s)]
*  letter, picture by picture. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2529.7799999999997s)]
*  Decorated with real gold. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2533.18s)]
*  It's just one of the library's 80,000 handwritten manuscripts from the ages before the printing [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2536.2599999999998s)]
*  press. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2542.18s)]
*  Add to that those two million or so printed books, Christian and pagan, sacred and profane, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2543.18s)]
*  in virtually every language known to man. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2550.3799999999997s)]
*  There are thousands of prints and drawings, windows on the past, and a huge collection [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2554.7799999999997s)]
*  of ancient coins. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2563.66s)]
*  This was the money of Palestine 2,000 years ago, including the kind of silver coins Judas [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2565.4s)]
*  was said to have been paid to betray Christ. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2571.88s)]
*  Here is a map of the world drawn 50 years before Columbus. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2575.96s)]
*  At its edge, the Towers of Paradise. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2580.56s)]
*  And an immediate bestseller, Columbus's description of his voyage to the New World, published [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2584.56s)]

*  Is there anyone, any single person who really knows what the library holds? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2619.08s)]
*  Nobody knows exactly what's there, because it would be impossible for the human brain [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2625.04s)]

*  But the Church refused to let Henry divorce Catherine of Aragon so he could marry Anne. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2862.12s)]
*  He married her anyway, broke with Rome, and took control of the Church of England. The [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2867.96s)]
*  country was largely converted to the Protestant faith. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2873.16s)]
*  This is one of the moments in the 16th century that leads to the fracturing of Christianity [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2877.04s)]
*  and to much of the bloodshed and the wars that especially the later 16th century was [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2883.16s)]
*  known for. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2888.12s)]
*  As man explored the planet, a scientific revolution was also underway. By the mid-17th century, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2892.6s)]
*  navigators had mapped much of the world in remarkable detail. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2900.6s)]

*  The Pope at the time, Pope Erwin VIII, who was a very good friend of Galileo, said to [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2926.96s)]
*  him, look, you know, I agree with you, you're right, but I can't approve of this because [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2931.0s)]

*  I'm going to shake to the foundation the belief of the world and the world's Christians, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2939.32s)]
*  not just Catholics. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2944.36s)]
*  Just 380 years later, in 1992, Pope John Paul II apologized for the Galileo affair. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2946.92s)]

*  the Church and science. In a recent sermon, he said, even the Big Bang theory of the creation [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2966.36s)]
*  of the universe is not in conflict with faith because God's mind was behind it. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2972.82s)]
*  This is the tricky part. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2979.42s)]
*  And backstage in the Pope's library, science is brought to bear on crumbling books as restoration [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2983.9s)]
*  workers deal with water damage, mold, and the ravages of time. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=2990.5800000000004s)]

*  scratching off paste put on by well-meaning restorers centuries ago. Paste that's turning [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=3006.18s)]
*  acid, eating away at the page. Mario Tabertzi seldom reads what he's repairing. It's too [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=3012.2599999999998s)]

*  written in Greek on papyrus by one of Peter's disciples around the year 200, a mere century [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JRKc2hc7M&t=3071.58s)]
