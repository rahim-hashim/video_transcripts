# Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán's Capture, Escape and Recapture | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms)
*  In the blood-soaked world of international drug cartels, for the top cops of U.S. law [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=0.0s)]
*  enforcement Joaquin Guzman was Public Enemy Number One, a title not bestowed on anyone [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=18.28s)]
*  since the gangster era of Al Capone and John Dillinger. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=24.64s)]
*  He earned that status by putting more narcotics on American streets than anyone in history. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=29.02s)]
*  Guzman, known by the nickname El Chapo, Spanish for Shorty, gained an outsized reputation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=34.98s)]
*  He bribed his way out of a Mexican prison in 2001, and for the next 13 years he used [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=42.3s)]
*  money, violence, and gee-whiz escapes worthy of a James Bond villain to avoid capture. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=48.86s)]
*  A myth grew that he was untouchable. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=55.74s)]
*  But tonight we will show you how in February Chapo was finally caught. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=59.02s)]
*  After the death of Osama Bin Laden, El Chapo became the most wanted man in the world. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=64.14s)]
*  So getting him was a big deal for you? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=71.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=73.94s)]
*  In my world it was like winning the Super Bowl, winning the World Series. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=74.94s)]
*  This was the actual trophy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=78.4s)]
*  He was number one? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=80.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=81.5s)]
*  This fight against drugs. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=82.58s)]
*  Eric Maltz was in charge of the DEA's Special Operations Division, tasked with finding [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=84.5s)]
*  Chapo. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=89.74s)]
*  What put him at the top of the list? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=90.96s)]
*  Making billions of dollars, having a reach around the world in Asia, in Australia, in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=92.76s)]
*  Africa, in Europe, putting poison on the streets not just in the United States but all over [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=97.98s)]
*  the world. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=102.94s)]
*  Jim Dinkins was head of Homeland Security Investigations. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=104.38s)]
*  He pursued El Chapo for more than a decade. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  He's a monster that happened to rise up in a criminal organization that was making billions [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=112.06s)]
*  of dollars. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=117.02s)]
*  A monster? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=118.02s)]
*  A monster. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=119.02s)]
*  Until both men retired in recent months, Dinkins and Maltz helped coordinate the U.S. hunt [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=120.58s)]
*  for Chapo. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=126.4s)]
*  His real name, Joaquin Guzman. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=127.58s)]
*  Incredibly, Guzman was on the Forbes magazine list of billionaires. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=130.94s)]
*  He was also known to be one of the most violent drug traffickers in the world. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=135.98000000000002s)]
*  As his Sinaloa cartel fought to dominate the drug trade, the war between the cartels turned [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=141.38s)]
*  the southern side of the U.S.-Mexico border into one of the most dangerous places on earth. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=147.38s)]
*  Thousands of people electrocuted, beheaded, chopping off limbs, throwing people in acid. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=154.1s)]
*  He committed some ruthless crimes in Mexico. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=161.86s)]
*  He's in custody now and doesn't look quite so ferocious. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=165.18s)]
*  Cowed, his head bowed. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=169.06s)]
*  But until he was apprehended by Mexican marines, Joaquin Guzman, the illiterate son of a farmer, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=171.74s)]
*  ran a multinational criminal empire. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=178.26s)]
*  They had not only transportation, they had manufacturing, they had domestic and local [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=181.46s)]
*  distribution channels. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=185.6s)]
*  Very sophisticated with Narco subs, with shipping vessels, with 747s, with private vessels, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=187.3s)]
*  with tractor trailers, rail cars. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=194.22s)]
*  The drug cartel was run like a Fortune 500 company. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=196.6s)]
*  He employed some very sophisticated counterintelligence operations to make sure that if law enforcement [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=201.56s)]
*  was getting close, they would never actually get to him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=207.4s)]
*  Chapo devised ingenious smuggling methods. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=210.4s)]
*  He packed drugs into fake cucumbers and bananas and mixed them with shipments of real produce. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=214.44s)]
*  But the thing he worked hardest on was making sure he could always get away. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=220.44s)]
*  Chapo was the first Mexican drug trafficker to hire architects and engineers to build [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=226.12s)]
*  elaborate tunnels, complete with railways to ferry drugs under the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=231.4s)]
*  And he spent millions adapting them to use as escape routes from his many hideouts. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=237.6s)]
*  This is very tight, very hot, very close. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=242.44s)]
*  We went down into a labyrinth of interlocking tunnels with the Mexican marines who chased him. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=246.94s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=252.44s)]
*  This was one of the ways Chapo was able to elude capture time and time again. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=253.76s)]
*  The Americans thought he was being tipped off by corrupt Mexican officials. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=259.36s)]
*  But the Mexicans bristled at the accusation they could not be trusted. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=263.76s)]
*  So there were suspicions on both sides of the border. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=268.28s)]
*  Absolutely, yes. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  So what was different this time? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=271.96s)]
*  The U.S. government and the Mexican government basically said enough is enough. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=274.86s)]
*  And we actually rolled up our sleeves, got in a room, argued a little bit, put all the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=279.68s)]
*  intelligence on the table, shared it with the Mexicans, and ultimately grabbed Chapo. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=285.56s)]
*  It started with a routine smuggling probe by Homeland Security investigators at the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=292.06s)]
*  border crossing in Nogales, Arizona. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=297.56s)]
*  A wiretap unexpectedly led to a phone linked to one of Chapo's men. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=300.44s)]
*  U.S. agents followed that thread for more than two years. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  Worked it from phone to phone, device to device, person to person, until they actually had [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=310.76s)]
*  wired out the communication structure. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=316.02s)]
*  And the communication structure was the key. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  It was a very clear picture to us on what was happening and how he was running his business. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  Several U.S. law enforcement agencies, the DEA, the Marshals, Homeland Security, and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=326.88s)]
*  the FBI were all pursuing Guzman separately. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=332.28s)]
*  But this time they decided to streamline their efforts and funnel everything through the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=336.67999999999995s)]
*  DEA. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=341.64s)]
*  And we had one voice in how we were going to pursue sharing intelligence with the Mexican [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=343.2s)]
*  officials. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=349.67999999999995s)]
*  Was that significant, that important to have that one voice? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=350.67999999999995s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  You can't do a job against Chapo Guzman unless you're working together. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  And Tomas Zaron was that voice on the Mexican side. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=359.44s)]
*  Zaron is chief of the investigative agency of the Prosecutor General of the Republic, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=365.4s)]
*  Mexico's version of the FBI. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=371.16s)]
*  The main U.S. assistance was surveillance, wiretapping, phone surveillance and that sort [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=373.56s)]
*  of thing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  I will just tell you they help us with technology because they're really good in technology [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=381.48s)]
*  and that will encapsulate everything. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=386.08s)]
*  Zaron, in turn, tapped the Mexican Marines to execute the plan. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=388.76000000000005s)]
*  They are elite special forces, highly trained and known for using deadly force. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  We watched one of their training sessions, an assault on a mock-up of a cartel hideout. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=401.18s)]
*  And we traveled with the Marines to Sinaloa, a remote state on the Pacific coast, and to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  its capital, Culiacan, Chapo's base of operations where his cartel still rules. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=412.68s)]
*  It was here in Culiacan on February 12th. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=419.96s)]
*  After weeks of secret surveillance, the Marines started to move on the cartel, rounding up [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=423.52s)]
*  Chapo's henchmen who started to talk. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=429.26s)]
*  There was a lot of close associates of Chapo that were arrested over these periods of time [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  and there was information developed that was provided to the Mexicans. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  So it wasn't just technical information, bank information, surveillance information, documents, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=443.44s)]
*  telephone information. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  Based on intelligence collected on both sides of the border, Marines raided a series of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=452.64s)]
*  cartel safe houses on February 17th. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=457.6s)]
*  They seized more than three tons of crystal meth and cocaine, automatic weapons and ammunition, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=461.2s)]
*  a rocket launcher and a diamond encrusted pistol with the initials of Joaquin Guzman. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  They also arrested one of Chapo's top lieutenants, a man called The Nose, and he flipped quickly. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=475.20000000000005s)]
*  He told them where Chapo was hiding and how he planned to escape. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=482.88s)]
*  Several weeks later, the Marines took us to the place where they were told Chapo was hiding. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=488.52000000000004s)]
*  This nondescript house in the midst of a middle class neighborhood was a fortress. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=493.9s)]
*  They had to ram their way through a reinforced steel door. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=499.29999999999995s)]
*  It took you eight minutes to open the door? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=502.62s)]
*  When they got inside, El Chapo was nowhere to be found, but they did find this. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=507.17999999999995s)]
*  The tub. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=513.42s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=514.42s)]
*  The escape hatch. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=517.34s)]
*  The bathtub was equipped with a hydraulic lift. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=519.46s)]
*  It's been turned off. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=522.64s)]
*  Very steep. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=524.08s)]
*  He couldn't have done this quickly. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=525.08s)]
*  But underneath is the entrance way to a hidden tunnel. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=526.9399999999999s)]
*  While Marines were battering down the front door, they say Guzman startled barefoot in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=531.1999999999999s)]
*  his underwear, clambered down these stairs and escaped through this tunnel with his bodyguard [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=537.78s)]
*  and two women. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=542.98s)]
*  This was part of a maze of tunnels connected to the city sewers of Culiacan and it turns [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=544.8s)]
*  out to six other safe houses, all equipped with hydraulically controlled bathtub escape [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=550.3s)]
*  hatches. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=555.92s)]
*  Our guide told us that even though they had a 10 minute head start, he could hear the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=557.3s)]
*  fugitives splashing through the water, but they were too far ahead to catch. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=561.8599999999999s)]
*  When the Marines emerged from this spillway by the river, El Chapo had vanished. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=567.8s)]
*  So what did you think when he got away once again in Culiacan? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=573.3s)]
*  I never believed that he would ever be captured. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=578.46s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=581.3000000000001s)]
*  I thought he was gone again. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=582.3000000000001s)]
*  I thought he may have been tipped off. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=583.62s)]
*  But the Mexican Marines just were relentless and they went from house to the tunnels, from [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=586.34s)]
*  tunnel to house, from house and they just kept on going. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=592.86s)]
*  Chapo and his wife, a one-time beauty queen, their twin toddlers, a nanny, a cook and his [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=596.1800000000001s)]
*  most trusted bodyguard were desperately trying to shake the Marines off their trail. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=603.16s)]
*  They ditched their phones and got new numbers. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=608.8s)]
*  He's a man on the run. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=611.68s)]
*  You need money, you need food, you need weapons. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=613.16s)]
*  And he was also very interested in knowing who had been arrested, I'm sure, and what [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=617.0799999999999s)]
*  was going on. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=620.7199999999999s)]
*  So it was very hard for him to go into isolation, complete isolation. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=621.7199999999999s)]
*  How was he communicating at this point? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=625.56s)]
*  I'm sure multiple different ways, but the ways that were the most vulnerable was back [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=627.6s)]
*  on cell phones. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=633.0s)]
*  Back using the cell phones? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=635.46s)]
*  Back using cell phones. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=636.64s)]
*  And you can't, now you're on the runs, how are they going to know what number to call? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=637.64s)]
*  You have to tell them, all right, well, I got a new phone number, here it is. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=641.82s)]
*  Well, you just told us to. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=644.48s)]
*  Five days later, the Americans traced the phone of Chapo's bodyguard to the resort [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=647.04s)]
*  city of Mazatlán, 136 miles away, and to this beachfront building. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=651.48s)]
*  They shared that intelligence with the Mexicans. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=657.56s)]
*  At exactly 640 a.m. on February 22nd, the Marines crashed through the door of number [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=661.32s)]
*  401. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=668.0s)]
*  When he saw the red beads of their laser sights speckled on his chest, the bodyguard threw [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=669.6400000000001s)]
*  down his rifle and threw up his hands. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=675.12s)]
*  Next, the Marines burst through the door of the master bedroom, where Chapo's wife stood [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=678.72s)]
*  naked by the bed. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=683.5200000000001s)]
*  A Marine pushed past her and kicked in the bathroom door. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=685.1600000000001s)]
*  There was somebody behind it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=688.94s)]
*  It was El Chapo. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=691.12s)]
*  Back in Mexico City, Tomás Zerón and his team were listening in real time as the high [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=694.72s)]
*  stakes drama of Chapo's capture unfolded. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=700.24s)]
*  Was there cheering? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=703.5600000000001s)]
*  Was there high-fiving? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  Of course it was a jubilee. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=705.5600000000001s)]
*  We felt at that point that we were all one, that we were all doing something to have a [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=710.0400000000001s)]
*  good Mexico. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=714.2s)]
*  We did not ever anticipate that he'd be captured alive. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=716.2s)]
*  We thought he'd fight to the death. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=718.88s)]
*  Were you surprised that he didn't? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=720.64s)]
*  I was surprised. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=722.4s)]
*  I was shocked. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=723.52s)]
*  Shocked? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=724.52s)]
*  Absolutely shocked. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=725.52s)]
*  What shocked you more, that he was captured or that he was captured without a shot? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=726.52s)]
*  Both. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=731.16s)]
*  Captured without a shot was pretty amazing. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=733.16s)]
*  The once mighty drug lord who terrorized Mexico and outfoxed his pursuers for 13 years was [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=736.12s)]
*  defeated. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=742.4s)]
*  Processed like any common criminal, Guzmán was fingerprinted, mugshots taken. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=743.84s)]
*  He was paraded before the press like a trophy and loaded onto a helicopter. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=750.2800000000001s)]
*  Looking dazed, scared and docile, El Chapo was flown to Altiplano prison, Mexico's super [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  max. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=763.8000000000001s)]
*  Law enforcement officials vow he will never escape again. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=764.8000000000001s)]
*  Sinaloa Cartel is still in business. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=769.8000000000001s)]
*  It's still deeply involved in drug trafficking. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=773.5600000000001s)]
*  So Guzmán is now gone, but has anything really changed? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=777.48s)]
*  The cartel continues. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=783.16s)]
*  But even though it continues, we have made detentions after we detained Guzmán. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=784.96s)]
*  We are not going to leave Sinaloa, and we are going to stay there until we dismantle [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=790.48s)]
*  the cartel completely. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=794.46s)]
*  We know that when you take out Bin Laden, that the threat of terrorism did not end. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=796.54s)]
*  Nor will the threat of drugs end by taking out El Chapo. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=802.96s)]
*  But it was still worth every bit of effort to take that man off, because it sends a signal [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=807.0s)]
*  that you are touchable. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=813.0600000000001s)]
*  By now, you've probably heard of one of the greatest prison breaks of all time. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=821.12s)]
*  It happened last July. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=825.9200000000001s)]
*  Joaquín Guzmán, known by his Spanish nickname El Chapo, or Shorty, is one of the most notorious [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=828.12s)]
*  and violent drug lords in the world. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=835.0799999999999s)]
*  He was a high-value captive. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=837.98s)]
*  He had broken out of prison before. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=839.64s)]
*  This time, he was locked away in a maximum-security penitentiary, the tightest prison in Mexico. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=842.18s)]
*  And yet he got away. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=849.12s)]
*  And even more stunning, he did so through a mile-long escape tunnel that opened up right [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=851.4s)]
*  into his shower stall, the only corner of his tiny cell security cameras couldn't see. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=857.28s)]
*  Even those who caught him last year were shocked by the escape. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=864.0s)]
*  Gets arrested for the second time, knowing that he'd escaped once before, goes to prison [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=869.0799999999999s)]
*  and is still able to escape a second time. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=875.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's something like no other criminal in history that you'll be able to find. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=877.6s)]
*  While he retired last year, Jim Dinkins was head of Homeland Security Investigations. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=882.64s)]
*  He was part of the international manhunt for El Chapo for more than a decade. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=887.84s)]
*  He was literally in a well-fortified, constructed prison designed to prevent such an escape. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=892.92s)]
*  The maximum-security prison in Mexico. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=900.6s)]
*  Yes, designed to penetrate people from coming from air and coming from land, but they didn't [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=902.8s)]
*  anticipate him coming from underground. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=908.26s)]
*  So that's exactly what he did. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=910.84s)]
*  Almost from the moment he was delivered here to Altiplano Prison in February 2014, a construction [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=913.7s)]
*  crew from his Sinaloa cartel began digging a tunnel to free him. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=920.58s)]
*  The walls here are as much as three feet thick. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=925.7s)]
*  The airspace above is restricted. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=928.62s)]
*  Cell phones, prison officials say they're jammed for miles around. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=931.22s)]
*  But none of that made a difference. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=935.7s)]
*  From almost a mile away, inside this hastily built cinder block structure in a farmer's [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=938.8599999999999s)]
*  field, Chapo's men dug down about three stories and then burrowed 4,921 feet straight toward [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=943.9399999999999s)]
*  Altiplano. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=953.0999999999999s)]
*  The tunnel went under the prison wall and beneath the plumbing, and with pinpoint accuracy, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=954.74s)]
*  it emerged directly into the shower stall of Guzman's ground-level cell. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=961.02s)]
*  It's very difficult to navigate underground. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=965.42s)]
*  This tunnel, I believe, went from point A to point B with only minor deviations, if [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=968.2s)]
*  any, and that is an engineering marvel in and of itself. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=972.36s)]
*  How difficult is that? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=975.84s)]
*  It's very, very difficult, but I'm sure when the boss is behind prison, you put your best [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=976.84s)]
*  team and your best foot forward, and they apparently did. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=981.44s)]
*  At 8.52 the night of Saturday, July 11th, El Chapo ducks into the shower stall behind [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=985.0400000000001s)]
*  a privacy wall, the only spot in the five-by-six-foot cell hidden from security cameras. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=991.24s)]
*  Then he disappears. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=997.88s)]
*  He climbed down into the tunnel and climbed atop a motorcycle, especially rigged on rail [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1000.64s)]
*  tracks to speed him to freedom. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1006.04s)]
*  By the time the alarm sounded and a search began, Guzman had vanished into the night. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1008.64s)]
*  What was your reaction when you heard that El Chapo had escaped again? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1015.08s)]
*  Disappointed, not shocked. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1018.92s)]
*  Chuck Rosenberg is head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1021.6s)]
*  He was in a maximum-security prison. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1026.36s)]
*  He had escaped previously in 2001, so it had happened before. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1028.1599999999999s)]
*  We knew, we knew he had intended to do it again. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1033.76s)]
*  You knew that he was planning to do it again? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1038.84s)]
*  We knew that he and his folks back in Sinaloa wanted to break him out. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1040.6s)]
*  We had general chatter maybe a year or so before he actually broke out a second time [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1046.4399999999998s)]
*  about what they hoped to do. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1053.2s)]
*  But there was nothing in that information we had about tunnels. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1055.4s)]
*  He's a notorious tunnel manufacturer and architect. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1060.0800000000002s)]
*  The tunnel king. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1063.52s)]
*  The tunnel king. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1064.52s)]
*  He's responsible for more sophisticated tunnels than I think any other person in the history [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1065.52s)]
*  of drug trafficking in Mexico. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1070.6000000000001s)]
*  During the last manhunt for El Chapo, his pursuers discovered this. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1073.52s)]
*  The tub. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1078.24s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1079.24s)]
*  A tunnel entrance also concealed in the plumbing, in this case, beneath the tub. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1081.8s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1086.84s)]
*  El Chapo was the first Mexican drug trafficker to hire architects and mining engineers to [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1088.48s)]
*  build elaborate super tunnels, complete with ventilation systems, electricity and railways [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1094.4s)]
*  to ferry drugs under the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1101.2s)]
*  The border between San Diego and Tijuana is one of the busiest international commercial [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1105.08s)]
*  zones in the world. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1110.0s)]
*  You'll see a steady stream of trucks passing north and south. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1111.88s)]
*  What you can't see is that beneath one four-mile stretch of this border, it's crisscrossed [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1116.48s)]
*  with dozens of smuggling tunnels. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1122.28s)]
*  Why? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1125.0s)]
*  Because this industrial part of Tijuana is right across the fence from acres and acres [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1126.24s)]
*  of warehouses in the U.S. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1131.16s)]
*  Drug smugglers dig down inside a building over here, pop up inside a warehouse in the [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1133.44s)]
*  U.S. just a couple hundred yards away. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1138.3999999999999s)]
*  This is where El Chapo's Sinaloa Cartel honed its tunneling technique. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1142.24s)]
*  So when did El Chapo first start digging tunnels here in this area? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1147.36s)]
*  On record, we have the first tunnel was in 2010. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1152.12s)]
*  Joe D'Ameglio is the chief of the San Diego Tunnel Task Force, made up of agents from [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1156.4799999999998s)]
*  Homeland Security, the Border Patrol and DEA. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1161.6399999999999s)]
*  The task force was established to respond to what the government deems a threat to national [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1165.72s)]
*  security. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1170.92s)]
*  And down this road, there's been multiple tunnels found in warehouses here. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1171.92s)]
*  What makes this area so appealing to them? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1177.96s)]
*  Just the infrastructure on both sides of the border in Otay Mesa and in Tijuana, you have [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1180.76s)]
*  all the commercial businesses there, import, export, and just the vast amount of warehouses [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1185.2s)]
*  there that are doing legitimate business. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1190.4s)]
*  And it's easy to conceal an illegitimate business within those warehouses. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1192.96s)]
*  And it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1197.28s)]
*  How much does it cost them to build one of these tunnels? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1199.96s)]
*  We've estimated it costs the cartel anywhere between a million to two million dollars. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1202.96s)]
*  If they have one successful push through of narcotics, they paid for that tunnel and then [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1208.52s)]
*  some. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1214.68s)]
*  One load gets through? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1215.68s)]
*  One load, not just one kilo. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1216.68s)]
*  We're talking tons of narcotics going through. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1218.88s)]
*  A load of marijuana, for example, could be worth as much as five to six million dollars. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1222.04s)]
*  Smugglers use the tunnels primarily to move marijuana because it's too bulky, too smelly, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1227.88s)]
*  too easy to detect to transport over land. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1234.04s)]
*  Domeglio's team took us down into one of El Chapo's now closed subterranean passageways. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1238.36s)]
*  They're dug through the clay-like soil with picks, shovels, and small power tools. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1244.72s)]
*  You can see the spade marks from the air hammer drill up on the ceiling going across. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1250.28s)]
*  And you can see how they just worked their way through the tunnel here as they were constructing [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1253.8799999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1257.76s)]
*  You have the rails, the rail system, the rail cart, the lighting, the ventilation. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1258.76s)]
*  But it's the concealment method that they've changed and became more sophisticated. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1261.72s)]
*  More elaborate, harder to find. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1267.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1268.44s)]
*  So what are they putting it under, up on the top? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1269.44s)]
*  This specific entry point for this tunnel was a bathroom floor that was on a hydraulic [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1271.52s)]
*  lift. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1274.52s)]
*  The lift actually lowered into another room, which was 30 feet below ground. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1275.76s)]
*  Some tunnels are so deep, as much as 90 feet underground, the task force has found no technology [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1280.8799999999999s)]
*  can detect them. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1287.44s)]
*  So they rely on wiretaps, tips from informants, or suspicious activity around the warehouses [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1289.04s)]
*  to locate the smuggling tunnels. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1295.36s)]
*  The tunnel that El Chapo's cartel built to break him out of prison, is there anything [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1297.8s)]
*  comparable to that here? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1304.32s)]
*  One of my guys actually went down there from the task force and actually walked in that [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1306.24s)]
*  tunnel and observed it. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1310.32s)]
*  And he came back and I asked him, so what did you think? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1312.3999999999999s)]
*  He goes, it's no different than what we see here. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1315.0s)]
*  It's exactly the same. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1317.9199999999998s)]
*  So they learned it here? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1319.48s)]
*  Every step that they go, every tunnel that they build, they learn from. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1320.8s)]
*  Along the way, El Chapo, named to Forbes Magazine list of billionaires, also learned his vast [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1324.76s)]
*  riches meant almost anything could be had for a price, possibly even his freedom. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1331.36s)]
*  DEA chief Chuck Rosenberg says he was disgusted by El Chapo's prison break. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1337.24s)]
*  A tunnel right under the maximum security prison and up into his cell. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1343.24s)]
*  Up into a shower stall. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1350.7199999999998s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1352.56s)]
*  We work with our Mexican counterparts all the time on cases big and small. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1353.8s)]
*  There's lots and lots and lots of good people down there, men and women who are with us [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1361.8799999999999s)]
*  in this. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1365.04s)]
*  There's also a degree of corruption down there that is disappointing, stunning. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1366.96s)]
*  Pick your adjective. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1372.6s)]
*  That's how it happens. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1375.12s)]
*  How high up do his tentacles of corruption and bribes? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1376.72s)]
*  How high up do they reach? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1383.36s)]
*  I don't know specifically how high up they reach. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1385.0s)]
*  My sense is that they're both broad and deep, that they go throughout the Mexican government. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1387.8799999999999s)]
*  U.S. law enforcement officials knew they had a reliable partner in the Mexican Marines [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1393.4799999999998s)]
*  the last time they hunted El Chapo. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1399.32s)]
*  We watched one of their training exercises last year and joined them on patrol in Sinaloa, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1402.1999999999998s)]
*  a mountainous state along Mexico's Pacific coast where the cartel still rules. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1407.64s)]
*  El Chapo had seven safe houses in the capital, Cuyacán, all connected by tunnels. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1413.8000000000002s)]
*  He also had a remote ranch outside the city in the rough terrain of the Sierra Madre. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1419.8000000000002s)]
*  Using intelligence and technology from the U.S., the Mexican Marines nabbed El Chapo [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1426.0400000000002s)]
*  in an early morning raid at this apartment in the Sinaloan resort town of Mazatlán. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1431.3600000000001s)]
*  The Marines took him into custody without firing a shot and delivered him to the gates [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1437.24s)]
*  of Altiplano Prison. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1442.3s)]
*  It seems to me that for somebody to break out of a maximum security prison, that there [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1444.6s)]
*  had to be help from the inside. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1448.92s)]
*  Logically, there had to be some sort of help. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1451.8s)]
*  Had to be. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1454.16s)]
*  He would have needed blueprints and schematics. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1455.16s)]
*  Yeah, unless they just tunneled up and got very lucky and hit his shower stall, you bet [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1457.8s)]
*  they would have needed something. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1462.04s)]
*  There's no question in my mind that he had help. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1463.92s)]
*  At the time of El Chapo's prison break, the U.S. government was pressing Mexico to extradite [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1468.0800000000002s)]
*  him, send him to trial here. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1473.44s)]
*  Where was the extradition process when he escaped? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1476.02s)]
*  We had made our request. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1479.2s)]
*  They knew of it. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1480.44s)]
*  The reason we asked for extradition is because his crimes have so grievously injured communities [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1481.5600000000002s)]
*  around the United States. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1487.16s)]
*  And we were concerned that he would do just what he did, escape justice in Mexico. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1489.92s)]
*  That wouldn't happen here. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1496.2s)]
*  Guzman's latest daring getaway has only magnified the myth of a criminal mastermind who could [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1498.3200000000002s)]
*  outsmart all of his pursuers. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1503.94s)]
*  In Sinaloa, he's a bona fide folk hero. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1509.3600000000001s)]
*  His admirers celebrate his exploits singing that he laughs at the law. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1512.78s)]
*  Do you have any idea where he is now? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1517.94s)]
*  No. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1522.18s)]
*  You think he would return home to Sinaloa? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1523.18s)]
*  Don't want to guess. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1526.18s)]
*  We got him twice. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1527.18s)]
*  I bet we'll get him again. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1528.82s)]
*  You do? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1530.52s)]
*  I do. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1531.52s)]
*  You're confident you'll get him again? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1532.52s)]
*  I'm reasonably confident we'll get him again. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1533.68s)]
*  I am not very confident that we'll ever catch him again. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1536.02s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1539.26s)]
*  Because when you go after Chapo, it's not like going after and arresting your local [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1540.5s)]
*  drug dealer or local criminal. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1543.9s)]
*  This is somebody you have to bring in an old team, an army, literally, of soldiers and [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1546.5s)]
*  military folks and police officers to go after and secure him. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1551.06s)]
*  So this is a big operation to go after somebody like Chapo. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1554.78s)]
*  And it took months, months and years and years to do that once before. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1559.06s)]
*  To help Mexico in the manhunt, the U.S. government is once again providing intelligence, equipment, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1563.9s)]
*  a $5 million reward. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1570.06s)]
*  The notorious narco known as El Chapo has achieved one of his greatest aspirations. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1580.9s)]
*  He's the most famous drug lord of all time. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1586.1s)]
*  This is our fourth 60-minute story about El Chapo, whose real name is Joaquin Guzman. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1589.22s)]
*  Our first story came when he was captured after 13 years on the run. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1595.22s)]
*  We told you then that El Chapo, Spanish for shorty, was on Forbes' list of billionaires [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1599.86s)]
*  and had earned an outsized reputation for his worldwide smuggling empire, his ruthless brutality, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1605.4199999999998s)]
*  and most of all for his daring getaways, like the one we told you about last year, when [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1612.34s)]
*  he vanished from a maximum-security Mexican prison through one of his trademark escape tunnels. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1617.78s)]
*  Then, there was our interview with actor Sean Penn, who met Guzman at a hideaway last fall. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1623.6999999999998s)]
*  After El Chapo's stunning prison break, many thought he'd never get caught again. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1629.86s)]
*  But he was. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1635.06s)]
*  How? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1636.54s)]
*  You're about to see. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1637.78s)]
*  Where in the pantheon of drug traffickers, drug lords, does El Chapo fall? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1640.4199999999998s)]
*  El Chapo resides at the very top of that hierarchy. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1648.74s)]
*  Peter Vincent was a senior official and legal adviser of both the Justice Department and [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1653.22s)]
*  Homeland Security during the international manhunt for Guzman. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1658.42s)]
*  He says after the daring escape last summer, El Chapo became almost delusional. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1662.58s)]
*  So what precipitated his downfall? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1668.9s)]
*  He became drunk on his own wine. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1672.16s)]
*  He started to believe the hype, that he was special, that he was almost a demigod, that [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1675.9s)]
*  he was something truly magical. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1682.1000000000001s)]
*  And he became so incredibly arrogant that he thought he was untouchable. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1686.86s)]
*  Jim Dinkins agrees. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1692.3s)]
*  As chief of Homeland Security Investigations, he was part of the U.S.-Mexico Task Force [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1694.26s)]
*  that nabbed El Chapo in 2014. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1699.9799999999998s)]
*  He knew how he was captured last time. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1704.2199999999998s)]
*  So he had the upper hand, right? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1707.78s)]
*  He had all the cards in his hand to go off in the sunset and to learn from his mistake. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1709.1799999999998s)]
*  But he just couldn't help himself. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1714.54s)]
*  And he remained in the public eye. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1716.3s)]
*  After his first escape from prison in 2001, Guzman virtually disappeared from sight for [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1719.06s)]
*  13 years, but not this time. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1725.1399999999999s)]
*  Here he gets out of prison and he's on the road being spotted at this place having drinks [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1728.74s)]
*  and this place with his family members. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1735.18s)]
*  He invited Sean Penn and the actress Kate Del Castillo to come in to see him. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1738.48s)]
*  Did Mexican law enforcement know that these two actors were going in to see El Chapo? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1745.62s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1751.82s)]
*  They knew where Sean was going to go, when he was going to land. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1752.82s)]
*  They knew right away. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1756.4199999999998s)]
*  How did they know? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1758.1s)]
*  Because they were listening in on the cartel's communications and watching. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1759.82s)]
*  Mexican and U.S. law enforcement reformed the task force that caught El Chapo the last [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1765.2199999999998s)]
*  time. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1770.3s)]
*  They were tracking not just Guzman, but everyone in his inner circle, including his cook and [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1771.3s)]
*  everyone his lieutenants contacted, including Sean Penn. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1777.34s)]
*  Did he become sloppy? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1780.8999999999999s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1782.98s)]
*  There was more sightings of him in the last six months than there was in the last 10 years [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1783.98s)]
*  before he was captured in 2014. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1787.4199999999998s)]
*  After he escaped the last time, you told us that you were not confident that he would [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1790.3s)]
*  ever be captured again. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1795.12s)]
*  That Del Chapo had become a smarter criminal. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1797.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1800.46s)]
*  Did you overestimate his intelligence? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1801.46s)]
*  I truly did. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1803.66s)]
*  Here he had over a year in prison. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1805.26s)]
*  I presumed he was using that same amount of time to think about how he was going to remain [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1807.3400000000001s)]
*  a fugitive for the rest of his life. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1811.18s)]
*  Mexican officials told us that only 20 days after his escape, the Marines had picked up [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1813.9s)]
*  on Guzman's trail. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1818.94s)]
*  They created an even smaller team of Mexican Marines, a search block, and they focused [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1820.78s)]
*  on the prize at hand. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1825.74s)]
*  And that was capturing El Chapo Guzman alive if they absolutely could. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1827.3s)]
*  Their first opportunity came in early October, just days after Sean Penn's visit. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1832.1399999999999s)]
*  The Marines told us they waited because they didn't want the American actor caught in the [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1837.7s)]
*  crossfire. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1842.54s)]
*  A team of Marines approached one of El Chapo's mountaintop ranches by Jungle Road, while [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1843.54s)]
*  another group of commandos flew in by helicopter. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1849.46s)]
*  So what went wrong on that October mission? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1853.62s)]
*  As I understand it, despite all of El Chapo Guzman's bravado of being a macho, very powerful [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1857.62s)]
*  man, he was running with a child in his arms. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1864.4199999999998s)]
*  A human shield, a baby as a shield? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1867.2199999999998s)]
*  That's the only way that one can rationally see it. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1870.2199999999998s)]
*  So once again, El Chapo got away. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1874.56s)]
*  In early December, intelligence led the Marines to this house in the sleepy coastal town [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1878.08s)]
*  of Los Mochis in northern Sinaloa. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1883.6s)]
*  Wiretap Intercepts talked about a visit planned by Grandma and Aunt, code names for El Chapo [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1886.8s)]
*  and his lieutenant known as Cholo Ivan. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1893.48s)]
*  The Marines watched the house for a month as painters and construction crews came and [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1897.56s)]
*  went. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1902.6799999999998s)]
*  Then on the morning of Thursday, January 7th, Grandma finally showed up. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1903.8200000000002s)]
*  An assault force quickly moved into position nearby. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1909.68s)]
*  That evening, someone in the house called out for a large order of tacos and this armored [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1913.8s)]
*  truck left to go pick up the food. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1919.42s)]
*  Chapo was having a party. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1922.3600000000001s)]
*  For an incredibly savvy, clever, almost a criminal genius that El Chapo Guzman was, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1924.6000000000001s)]
*  he ultimately was done in by very simple tastes. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1932.5s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1935.74s)]
*  Tacos, tequila and chicas. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1936.74s)]
*  At 4.40 a.m. in the pre-dawn hours of Friday, January 8th, the Marines began battering down [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1942.46s)]
*  the gate of Chapo's safe house. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1949.6s)]
*  We've concealed the identities of the commando leaders for their safety. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1952.22s)]
*  So when we first knocked on the door of the house, the shooting started. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1959.86s)]
*  A fierce gun battle erupted. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1965.5s)]
*  The first Marine through the door was shot in the arm. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1970.4599999999998s)]
*  I watched the videotape. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1974.5s)]
*  It's very intense. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1976.26s)]
*  Chapo's people inside the house were firing high caliber rounds, grenades, so it was like [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1978.3s)]
*  a war zone. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1986.1s)]
*  The Marines moved methodically through the house. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1990.3799999999999s)]
*  Chapo's henchmen retreated up the stairs. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1996.74s)]
*  Just inside the door, one gunman lay dead. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=1999.9399999999998s)]
*  Down the hall, four more taken prisoner and the commandos quickly check a walk-in closet [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2003.84s)]
*  covered with full-length mirrors. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2009.34s)]
*  Upstairs, the Marines find two women, one of them the cook, cowering on the bathroom [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2011.86s)]
*  floor. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2017.86s)]
*  Inside the house, more commandos fought it out with gunmen who fled across the rooftops. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2019.62s)]
*  When it was over, there were five cartel members dead and six in custody. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2025.6999999999998s)]
*  But once again, Chapo, with Cholo Ivan, had vanished. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2031.2199999999998s)]
*  A couple of days later, the Marines took us to the safe house in Los Moches in an armed [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2036.4599999999998s)]
*  convoy. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2041.6999999999998s)]
*  Here, just inside the gate, a pool of blood where the Marine was shot. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2042.6999999999998s)]
*  Blood. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2047.86s)]
*  Blood. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2048.86s)]
*  And inside the door, more blood stains. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2049.86s)]
*  The walls pockmarked with bullet holes and the scars of exploding shrapnel. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2052.62s)]
*  And remember that walk-in closet? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2057.62s)]
*  The mirrors masked a hidden door. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2059.82s)]
*  Behind the secret door, the entrance to one of El Chapo's trademark tunnels. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2063.14s)]
*  It's connected to a network of storm drains and sewers. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2067.82s)]
*  It was 45 minutes before they found El Chapo's escape route. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2072.22s)]
*  That morning, the Marines gave chase. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2076.78s)]
*  We intensified the search inside the tunnels, opening manhole covers and inserting people [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2079.48s)]
*  into the sewers. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2086.5200000000004s)]
*  Then it started raining. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2088.1200000000003s)]
*  Hard. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2090.0800000000004s)]
*  After 20 minutes of rain, we thought that Chapo might drown in the sewers because of [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2091.0800000000004s)]
*  the high level of the water. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2098.88s)]
*  So he popped up out of the manhole right in the middle of a busy street. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2100.82s)]
*  That was his only option. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2106.16s)]
*  So this is where he came out. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2110.04s)]
*  He popped out of this manhole cover, which is about a half mile from the house, straight [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2112.0s)]
*  down the road there. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2116.2s)]
*  Look carefully at the security camera footage from the gas station across the street. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2118.2s)]
*  At 8.55 a.m., four hours after the first shots were exchanged, right there, you can [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2123.16s)]
*  see Chapo and Cholo Ivan climbing out of the sewer. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2129.36s)]
*  And then in this cell phone video, you can see them carjack a white VW Jetta and speed [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2133.56s)]
*  away. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2139.48s)]
*  The fugitives got only three blocks before the Jetta broke down. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2140.72s)]
*  So they jacked a second car, a red Ford Focus. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2145.12s)]
*  But only a couple of miles out of town, that car broke down. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2149.1s)]
*  Within minutes, the Federal Emergency Center got two reports of hijacked vehicles. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2153.86s)]
*  On the highway out of town, the Marines found the Ford already on the bed of a tow truck, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2159.02s)]
*  but no sign of Chapo and his lieutenant. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2164.98s)]
*  They had been picked up by the federal police and taken to a nearby motel. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2167.9s)]
*  What were they doing in the backseat of the police car? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2173.14s)]
*  They weren't talking. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2177.78s)]
*  They were relaxed, but they looked confused. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2178.78s)]
*  No one knows why the federal police took Chapo to the motel instead of to jail. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZmCoNyDBms&t=2182.3s)]
