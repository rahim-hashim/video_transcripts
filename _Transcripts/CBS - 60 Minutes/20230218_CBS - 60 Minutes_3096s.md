# Stories from 2008's Great Recession | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [February 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A)
*  A lot of people are worried about their bank these days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=0.0s)]
*  While devastated giants like Citigroup get bailed out again and again and again, many [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=17.28s)]
*  smaller banks are failing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=23.04s)]
*  The federal agency that takes over unsound banks is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=25.62s)]
*  the same people who guarantee that depositors won't lose their money. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=31.14s)]
*  Most every Friday now, the FDIC is seizing several banks. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=35.34s)]
*  You haven't seen these takeovers happening because they're done secretly at night to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=40.3s)]
*  make sure that there's no needless panic by depositors. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=44.82s)]
*  But last week, we were given extraordinary access to one of these operations. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=48.42s)]
*  Because the FDIC wants you to see what happens to your money when your bank has failed. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=53.76s)]
*  They're going to start at one branch, pull the cash out, take it inside the bank. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=58.76s)]
*  This is a team of FDIC agents preparing to seize a bank outside Chicago. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=64.88s)]
*  What we need to do is we need to pull the corporate records. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=70.2s)]
*  They've checked into this hotel under a fictitious name, CB and Associates. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=73.68s)]
*  To prevent a run on the bank, they don't want anyone to know who they are or why they're here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=78.78s)]
*  You all know that this is for the closing of Heritage Community Bank. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=84.74s)]
*  Cheryl Bates and Arthur Cook are in charge of the operation that has been given the code [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=89.02s)]
*  name HAPPY, strange, considering what they're about to do. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=93.54s)]
*  Do not discuss outside of this room what is going on, what we're here for. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  We're here to seize all five branches of Heritage Community Bank, a 40-year-old local bank [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=104.16s)]
*  providing savings, student loans, mortgages and checking. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  But like so many others recently, Heritage made ruinous bets on real estate. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=115.28s)]
*  Sheila Baer is chairman of the FDIC. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=120.6s)]
*  How many banks failed last year? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=124.0s)]
*  Twenty-five. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=125.64s)]
*  How many do you expect to fail this year? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=126.64s)]
*  It's going up. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=128.32s)]
*  There have been 16 already now. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=129.32s)]
*  So our loss projections are going up. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=131.85999999999999s)]
*  We're having to increase premiums on banks to address the loss projections going forward. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=133.92s)]
*  It's a very distressed environment right now. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=138.84s)]
*  I wonder if you have a number in mind of how much the FDIC is prepared to pay for bank [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=140.4s)]
*  failures in 2009. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=146.6s)]
*  Well, we make a five-year projection that for the next five years we project that we'll [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=148.32s)]
*  lose $65 billion on bank closings. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=154.24s)]
*  $65 billion. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=157.12s)]
*  $65 billion. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=158.12s)]
*  All of that was about to be spent on the imminent failure of Heritage Community Bank. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=159.12s)]
*  It held 12,000 deposits totaling more than $200 million. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  The FDIC team waited for the last customer to leave. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=168.88s)]
*  Cheryl Bates prepared to go in. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=172.68s)]
*  What sorts of specialists do you have on this team? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=175.28s)]
*  We have accountants. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=179.12s)]
*  We have asset specialists who specialize in loans. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=180.96s)]
*  We have people who specialize in just the physical facilities. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=184.5s)]
*  And we have a group of investigators that come in and do a review on the reasons for [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=189.9s)]
*  the bank failure. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=195.02s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=196.02s)]
*  Your whole team could come in and run the bank? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=197.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=199.1s)]
*  Four months ago, the FDIC in the state of Illinois ordered the bank to stop risky lending [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=200.1s)]
*  and raise cash. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=205.58s)]
*  But Heritage couldn't find new investors. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=207.22s)]
*  The night of February 27th, no one at the bank knew that the end was minutes away. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=209.74s)]
*  The FDIC walked into all five branches at once. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=216.22s)]
*  The chief executive, John Safir, was told that the bank that was his life's work was [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  no longer his. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  We waited outside as they delivered the news to the employees. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=226.86s)]
*  With Heritage Bank, your pay stopped at 6 p.m. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  At 6.01, you went on a pay which was paid by the FDIC. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=235.45999999999998s)]
*  Unused vacation time, you will be paid for it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=241.38s)]
*  You will not lose it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=244.61999999999998s)]
*  In that moment, Operation Happy looked pretty grim. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=245.61999999999998s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=248.89999999999998s)]
*  Because I would say a large majority of the employees don't know that the bank is in [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=249.89999999999998s)]
*  trouble and that it's about to close. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=255.7s)]
*  We want it to be as seamless as possible for your depositors so no depositor loses any [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=257.86s)]
*  money at all. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=262.98s)]
*  They reacted somewhat with dismay and shock that we were there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=264.06s)]
*  And it is a very trying period for them. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=269.46000000000004s)]
*  So it is an end to that whole chapter of their lives. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=273.70000000000005s)]
*  When we walk in, we appear to be the bad guys. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=277.5s)]
*  Some of those people have been there more than 20 years. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  And those are the ones who take it the hardest because they feel that they have put their [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  life into it and now it's no longer there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=288.14000000000004s)]
*  Make sure that no one comes in without FDIC badges. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=291.3s)]
*  The employees now work for the FDIC. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=295.09999999999997s)]
*  A public notice went up and that was the signal to a team of nearly 80 people to take over [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=297.94s)]
*  the bank. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=303.86s)]
*  They took control of the bank website and added a notice that all deposits were safe. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=305.62s)]
*  Then they started an inventory of all the assets and liabilities. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=311.9s)]
*  What's happening right now? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=318.06s)]
*  They're getting the bank personnel assigned with their FDIC counterparts. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=319.5s)]
*  The accounting people are meeting with our accounting managers and then we have an investigations [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=324.74s)]
*  group that comes in and does a review of the bank. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=329.14s)]
*  They broke the news to the media and prepared to reopen the bank Saturday morning as usual. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=332.2s)]
*  What do you expect from the customers? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=337.86s)]
*  I think the customers, some of them will come in with a sense of fear. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=339.62s)]
*  The fire created the FDIC in 1933 after the depression set off panics that wiped out even [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=345.1s)]
*  healthy banks. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=351.86s)]
*  We've been around for 75 years. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=353.46000000000004s)]
*  Nobody's ever lost a penny of insured deposits. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=355.26000000000005s)]
*  No depositor has ever lost a penny since the FDIC went into business. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=357.38s)]
*  That's right, of insured deposits. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=361.22s)]
*  That's absolutely right, which is why you need to make sure you're below the insured [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=362.22s)]
*  deposit limits, but no, no one's ever lost a penny. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=364.94s)]
*  And the insured deposit limit is what? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=367.3s)]
*  Right now it's 250,000. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=369.26000000000005s)]
*  That's the base limit. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=370.82000000000005s)]
*  The FDIC comes in and makes depositors whole at a bank that has failed. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=372.7s)]
*  Is that tax money? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=377.46s)]
*  No, it is money from our reserves and we are funded by insurance premiums that are assessed [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=379.14s)]
*  on banks. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=385.18s)]
*  So no, it is not taxpayer money. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=386.18s)]
*  FDIC Chairman Sheila Baer is a former treasury official and professor of finance who's written [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=388.22s)]
*  children's books on the wisdom of saving. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=393.98s)]
*  Maybe some of the CEOs on Wall Street should have read the children's books. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=397.62s)]
*  Maybe so. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=400.78s)]
*  Maybe so. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=403.05999999999995s)]
*  Baer warned two years ago that bad mortgages threaten the financial system. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=404.05999999999995s)]
*  Now she's managing the biggest bank failures in years, including the collapse of Washington [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=409.58s)]
*  Mutual and last summer's sudden failure of IndyMac in California. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=414.38s)]
*  We were told we would get in. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=418.97999999999996s)]
*  Stay open an extra hour! [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=421.97999999999996s)]
*  When IndyMac failed, you were watching these scenes on television of people lining up outside [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=423.82s)]
*  the bank like it was 1932. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=429.94s)]
*  Yes, it was. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=432.26s)]
*  What did you think of that? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=433.26s)]
*  I think people just forgot that banks do fail and how the FDIC works. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=434.26s)]
*  Their money was safe. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=438.18s)]
*  It was probably the safest place in the world to have your money because we were operating [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=439.18s)]
*  the institution at that point. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=442.58000000000004s)]
*  What sort of hit was that on your balance sheet? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=444.22s)]
*  I think we ended up to over $9 billion for a $33 billion. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=446.42s)]
*  Yes, it was very stiff. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=450.22s)]
*  The question becomes how many times can the FDIC do that? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=451.86s)]
*  At what point is the FDIC broke? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=456.6s)]
*  The FDIC is back by the full faith and credit of the United States government. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=458.82s)]
*  So if we need to, we try not to and don't want to, but if we need to, we can borrow [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=462.21999999999997s)]
*  from Treasury to make up for any shortfalls. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=465.54s)]
*  So the FDIC never goes broke? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=468.3s)]
*  We don't go broke. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=470.09999999999997s)]
*  No, we are the government. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=471.1s)]
*  We're back by the full faith and credit of the United States government. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=472.1s)]
*  But customers at the former Heritage Community Bank outside Chicago weren't so sure about [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=474.88s)]
*  the safety of their money. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=479.46s)]
*  On Saturday morning, the bank reopened on time and the FDIC's Ricky McCullough stood [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=481.3s)]
*  at the front door. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=486.9s)]
*  To people who were coming in this morning, what were they asking you? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=488.1s)]
*  Can I still write checks? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=491.86s)]
*  Can I access my safe deposit box? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=492.86s)]
*  Can I use my ATM machine? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=495.98s)]
*  And to all those questions, you answered what? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=498.46000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=500.98s)]
*  Customer Bill Hess showed up on a mission with an empty briefcase. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=502.42s)]
*  He intended to leave with all of his money. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=506.3s)]
*  We'd be glad to ask any questions for you. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=508.74s)]
*  He said, I don't care anymore. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=511.74s)]
*  And so I became a little concerned. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=514.02s)]
*  So I came inside and one of the things that he told me as he opened up his briefcase, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=515.3s)]
*  he said, well, I don't have a gun in here. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=519.3399999999999s)]
*  So I said, well, that's good. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=521.06s)]
*  I count. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=522.06s)]
*  McCullough explained to Hess and his wife Audrey that their savings were safe. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=523.06s)]
*  So if you have a single account, that's 250. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=527.38s)]
*  If you have a single account, that's 250. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=529.38s)]
*  So now that's 500. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=531.3399999999999s)]
*  Hess's briefcase was empty when he came in and empty when he came out. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=533.0999999999999s)]
*  We just thought we were going to see closed and the doors locked. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=537.66s)]
*  You know. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=540.6999999999999s)]
*  So how do you feel now that you've talked to them? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=541.6999999999999s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=543.78s)]
*  Assured. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=545.26s)]
*  Assured. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=546.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=547.26s)]
*  You feel assured? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=548.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=549.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=550.26s)]
*  You have confidence in the FDIC. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=551.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=552.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=553.26s)]
*  Now if they can't pay you, then I won't have confidence in them either. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=554.26s)]
*  One customer did take most of her money out, but for many, their concern was for the bank [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=555.26s)]
*  employees. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=561.5799999999999s)]
*  I hope you all stay and I hope they don't let anybody go. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=562.5799999999999s)]
*  We're fine. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=566.3s)]
*  Good. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=567.3s)]
*  You just keep coming back to see us. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=568.3s)]
*  There are three ways the FDIC takes over a bank. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=570.42s)]
*  It can close it and pay off depositors, run the bank itself, or more often, it'll try [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=574.6600000000001s)]
*  to find a buyer. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=579.94s)]
*  We do have bids from five different parties. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=581.02s)]
*  A few days before the takeover of Heritage Community Bank, we were at the FDIC office [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=583.9s)]
*  in Dallas where they were holding a secret online auction in hopes of finding a buyer [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=589.5400000000001s)]
*  for Heritage. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=595.22s)]
*  I wanted to congratulate you. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=596.22s)]
*  We've chosen to accept one of your three bids. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=597.98s)]
*  The winner was MB Financial, a $9 billion Chicago bank. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=602.3s)]
*  The night of the takeover, all of Heritage Community's branches became MB Banks. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=607.3s)]
*  Mitchell Feiger is MB CEO. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=613.66s)]
*  It's almost as if nothing had happened. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=616.5s)]
*  Almost nothing did happen. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=619.0999999999999s)]
*  It's the same products, it's the same services, it's the same people taking care of the same [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=620.78s)]
*  customers. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=624.38s)]
*  It was a sweet deal for Feiger. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=625.38s)]
*  The FDIC paid MB Financial $3.5 million. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=627.14s)]
*  MB got all of the deposits, customers, and loans. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=631.62s)]
*  If some of those loans go bad in the future, the FDIC will pick up at least 80% of the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=635.98s)]
*  losses. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=641.98s)]
*  We wondered what Feiger thinks of the health of banking today. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=643.3s)]
*  You have to believe that dozens and dozens and dozens of more banks have to fail. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=646.58s)]
*  But it's okay. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=651.06s)]
*  What do you mean it's okay? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=652.06s)]
*  It's okay because I think the process is smooth. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=653.7s)]
*  Survivors are fully protected by an industry-funded FDIC insurance. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=656.74s)]
*  And I think that taking out the weak players and taking some capacity out of the industry [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=663.66s)]
*  is good. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=667.78s)]
*  It's good for the industry, it's good for the survivors. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=668.78s)]
*  It will produce, at the end, a much healthier banking system. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=670.38s)]
*  If you can put Heritage Community Bank out of its misery, why can't you do the same with [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=673.98s)]
*  Citigroup? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=680.0600000000001s)]
*  First of all, I don't talk about open operating institutions. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=681.0600000000001s)]
*  We can only deal with the resolution of a bank, a federally chartered or state chartered [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=684.06s)]
*  depository institution. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=689.06s)]
*  And these very large institutions that are creating the headlines now, these are really [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=691.18s)]
*  very large financial organizations. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=695.42s)]
*  So it's more than a bank. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=697.3399999999999s)]
*  It's a broker-dealer. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=698.6199999999999s)]
*  It's offshore operations. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=699.9s)]
*  It's foreign deposits. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=701.26s)]
*  We notice that while giant banks get bailed out, investors in failed community banks like [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=702.78s)]
*  Heritage get wiped out. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=708.9s)]
*  Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, says that the system is unfair for smaller [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=711.54s)]
*  banks, and that's just the way it is. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=716.22s)]
*  Well, I think that's true. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=718.62s)]
*  And going forward, I think we need to really review the size of these institutions and [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=720.66s)]
*  whether we should do something about that. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=725.62s)]
*  Bayer surprised us when she suggested that maybe the mega-banks, those bailed out by [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=727.42s)]
*  the taxpayers, shouldn't be allowed to exist in the future. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=732.22s)]
*  I think that may be something that Congress needs to think about. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=735.94s)]
*  Should we limit how big a bank can be? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=738.78s)]
*  Well, you know, I think taxpayers rightfully should ask that if an institution has become [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=741.58s)]
*  so large that there is no alternative except for the taxpayers to provide support, should [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=747.34s)]
*  we allow so many institutions to exceed that kind of threshold? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=751.98s)]
*  The idea would be that no bank would grow so large that it posed a systemic risk to [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=755.34s)]
*  the economy. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=760.46s)]
*  That'd be a very different world. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=761.46s)]
*  It would be a different world. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=763.22s)]
*  Because Heritage Community Bank was bought by MB Financial, the FDIC didn't have to [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=765.54s)]
*  pay depositors. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=770.38s)]
*  Even accounts over the insurance limit were safe. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=771.98s)]
*  For Cheryl Bates, it was her fourth closing this year, but certainly not her last. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=775.38s)]
*  What do you want people to think when you tell them you're from the FDIC? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=781.2199999999999s)]
*  I always want them to think that I'm one of the good guys and that we want to make sure [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=786.74s)]
*  that they get their money back. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=791.0999999999999s)]
*  Should their bank fail, that they are going to be okay because the FDIC is there. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=792.9s)]
*  On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers, the fourth largest investment bank in the world, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=808.42s)]
*  declared bankruptcy, sparking chaos in the financial markets and nearly bringing down [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=814.42s)]
*  the global economy. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=819.22s)]
*  It was the largest bankruptcy in history, larger than General Motors, Washington Mutual, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=821.1800000000001s)]

*  Included in the nine-volume, 2,200-page report was the finding that there was enough evidence [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=840.82s)]
*  for a prosecutor to bring a case against top Lehman officials and one of the nation's [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=846.38s)]
*  top accounting firms for misleading government regulators and investors. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=851.58s)]
*  That was two years ago, and there have been no prosecutions. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=856.42s)]
*  Anton Veloukas has never given an interview about his report until now. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=860.22s)]
*  This is the largest bankruptcy in the world. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=865.06s)]
*  What were the effects? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=866.82s)]
*  The effects were the financial disaster that we are living our way through right now. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=867.9s)]

*  lost all or almost all of their money, triggering a chain reaction that produced the worst financial [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=889.1800000000001s)]
*  crisis and economic downturn in 70 years. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=895.34s)]
*  Anton Veloukas' job was to provide the bankruptcy court with accurate, reliable information [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=899.7s)]
*  that the judges could use to resolve the claims of creditors picking over Lehman's corpse. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=905.22s)]
*  Have you ever done anything like this before? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=910.3000000000001s)]
*  I've never done anything like Lehman Brothers, and I don't think anybody else has ever done [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=912.38s)]
*  anything like Lehman Brothers. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=915.5s)]
*  So your job, I mean, in some ways, your job was to assess blame. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=916.94s)]
*  Our job is to determine what actually happened. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=920.46s)]
*  Put the cards face up on the table and let everybody see what the facts truly are. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=922.82s)]
*  Veloukas' team spent a year and a half interviewing hundreds of former employees and pouring over [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=926.94s)]
*  34 million documents. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=932.5s)]
*  They told of how Lehman bought up huge amounts of real estate that it couldn't unload when [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=935.22s)]
*  the market went south, how it had borrowed $44 for every one it had in the bank to finance [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=939.54s)]
*  the deals, and how Lehman executives manipulated balance sheets and financial reports when [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=945.38s)]
*  investors began losing confidence and competitors closed in. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=951.54s)]
*  Did these quarterly reports represent to investors a fair, accurate picture of the company's [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=955.94s)]
*  financial condition? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=963.22s)]
*  In our opinion, they did not. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=964.64s)]
*  Isn't that against the law? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=965.9s)]
*  Certainly, in our opinion, it was against civil law, if you will. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=967.66s)]
*  There were colorable claims that this was a fraud, yes. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=971.3s)]
*  By colorable claims, Veloukas means there is sufficient evidence for the Justice Department [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=973.94s)]
*  or the Securities and Exchange Commission to bring charges against top Lehman executives, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=978.86s)]
*  including CEO Richard Fold, for overseeing and certifying misleading financial statements [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=984.02s)]
*  and against Lehman's accountant, Ernst & Young, for failing to challenge Lehman's numbers. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=990.46s)]
*  They fudged the numbers. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=995.9s)]
*  They would move what turned out to be approximately $50 billion of assets from the United States [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=997.26s)]
*  to the United Kingdom just before they printed their financial statements. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1002.22s)]
*  And a week or so after the financial statements had been distributed to the public, that $50 [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1006.5s)]
*  billion would reappear here in the United States, back on the books in the United States. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1010.26s)]
*  The next financial statement, they would move it overseas again and file the report and [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1014.54s)]
*  then move it back. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1019.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1020.46s)]
*  It sounds like a shell game. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1021.46s)]
*  It was a shell game. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1022.46s)]
*  It was a gimmick. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1023.46s)]
*  Lehman misused an accounting trick called repo 105 to temporarily remove the $50 billion [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1025.02s)]
*  from its ledgers to make it look as though it was reducing its dependency on borrowed [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1031.34s)]
*  money and was drawing down its debt. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1036.02s)]
*  Lehman never told investors or regulators about it. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1039.08s)]
*  This is really deception to make the company look healthier than it was. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1042.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1046.12s)]
*  Deliberate? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1047.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1048.12s)]
*  How are you so sure of that? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1049.12s)]
*  Because we read the emails in which we observed people saying that they were doing it. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1050.12s)]
*  We interviewed the witnesses who wrote those emails or some of those emails and asked them [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1055.5s)]
*  why they were doing it. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1059.48s)]
*  And they told us they were doing it for purposes of affecting the numbers. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1060.56s)]
*  Do you think Lehman executives knew that this was wrong? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1063.9199999999998s)]
*  For some of them, certainly. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1066.9199999999998s)]
*  There were concerns being expressed at high levels about whether this is appropriate, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1068.08s)]
*  what happens if the street finds out about it. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1072.24s)]
*  So there was a concern that there's a real question about whether we can do this, whether [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1074.12s)]
*  this was right or not. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1078.6799999999998s)]
*  One of those people was Matthew Lee, who had been a senior executive at Lehman and the [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1079.96s)]
*  accountant responsible for its global balance sheet. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1084.5s)]
*  Lee was one of the first to raise objections inside Lehman about the accounting trick known [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1088.1599999999999s)]
*  as repo 105. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1093.24s)]
*  It sounded like a rat poison, repo 105, when I first heard it. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  So I investigated what it was and I didn't like what I saw. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1100.72s)]
*  Was there a point in which you saw the accounting principles employed by Lehman Brothers change? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1106.1000000000001s)]
*  November 30, 2007 was the end of our fiscal year and I fully expected us to make a loss [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1110.92s)]
*  that year like everyone else. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1118.78s)]
*  When I saw we made money, it was a record year in fact, I thought that doesn't sound right. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1122.36s)]
*  You knew the markets were doing badly, so why wasn't Lehman doing badly? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1127.2s)]
*  And every time I found something and I went to my boss or whoever, no response. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1130.84s)]
*  That was ten months before Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1135.48s)]
*  Lee's position required him to sign off on the accuracy of the firm's accounting practices [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1138.6s)]
*  every quarter, but in November of 2007, he declined to do it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1143.0s)]
*  By refusing to sign it, you were saying that you didn't believe the numbers? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1148.08s)]
*  Correct. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1152.26s)]
*  That this wasn't a fair and accurate representation of the financial condition of Lehman Brothers? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1153.26s)]
*  Right, summing's up here. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1157.4199999999998s)]
*  Why can't people answer my questions? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1159.02s)]
*  Why has repo 105 doubled? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1161.1s)]
*  Give me an answer. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1162.78s)]
*  Nothing was said. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1165.86s)]
*  Lee continued to press people for more information, but nothing changed. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1167.7s)]
*  In four months before Lehman collapsed, he sent this letter to Lehman's top executives. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1172.1799999999998s)]
*  I've been telling you all year, I've been banging my head against the wall. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1177.34s)]
*  I'm now putting in writing. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1181.5s)]
*  Says it requires me to bring the attention of management conduct and actions on the part [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1183.1399999999999s)]
*  of the firm that I consider to be possibly unethical and unlawful. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1186.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1192.34s)]
*  What were you talking about specifically? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1193.34s)]
*  Well, in that particular letter, it was general. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1195.82s)]
*  There were so many specifics, I could have written laundry lists. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1197.9399999999998s)]
*  What kind of a response did you get from this letter? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1201.22s)]
*  It's like throwing a grenade. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1204.02s)]
*  I wanted to wake somebody up, at least to address the topics. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1205.42s)]
*  It worked. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1211.02s)]
*  Six days after he sent that letter, Matthew Lee was downsized, let go after 14 years. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1212.02s)]
*  But Lehman executives couldn't ignore the letter and asked their accountants from Ernst [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1217.82s)]
*  and Young to interview Matthew Lee. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1222.06s)]
*  And in those interviews, we have the notes which are part of the report. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1224.78s)]
*  He says very specifically, $50 billion repo transactions moving money off the balance [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1229.46s)]
*  sheet at quarter end. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1234.46s)]
*  So our conclusion was Ernst and Young certainly knew it as of that time and did nothing with it. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1236.7s)]
*  Volucas says Ernst and Young was legally bound to make sure that Lehman's audit committee [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1242.66s)]
*  and its board of directors knew about Lee's allegations of unethical and unlawful accounting [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1247.74s)]
*  practices, but they never did. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1253.6200000000001s)]
*  Did the audit committee know? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1256.48s)]
*  No. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1258.1000000000001s)]
*  Did the board of directors know? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1259.1000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1260.3000000000002s)]
*  Did Dick Fold know? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1261.3000000000002s)]
*  Did Dick Fold know? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1264.26s)]
*  Well, he says no. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1265.26s)]
*  The only place Lehman CEO Richard Fold has publicly answered questions about his firm's [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1267.14s)]
*  bankruptcy has been in front of Congress. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1272.18s)]
*  I have absolutely no recollection whatsoever of hearing anything about or seeing documents [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1274.86s)]
*  related to repo 105 transactions while I was the CEO of Lehman. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1281.42s)]
*  He said the same thing to me face to face. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1286.5s)]
*  Do you believe him? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1288.42s)]
*  There was evidence which would show that that's not accurate. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1290.1s)]
*  The president of Lehman Brothers told us that in fact he had conversations with Dick Fold [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1293.4599999999998s)]
*  about this and documents were shared with him which would reflect the repo 105 transactions [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1297.58s)]
*  and how they were being used. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1302.06s)]
*  Richard Fold's view on that was that he has no knowledge of it. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1303.6599999999999s)]
*  You have other evidence that he did. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1306.74s)]
*  A jury would have to decide who's telling the truth. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1308.78s)]
*  But so far there's been no jury to hear the evidence. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1311.2199999999998s)]
*  Despite Volukis's findings and the supporting documents and testimony to back them up, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1314.7s)]
*  the Securities and Exchange Commission has not brought any charges of any kind against [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1320.02s)]
*  former Lehman executives. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1324.94s)]

*  I'm not permitted to be bothered by that. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1342.78s)]
*  My job was to set out the facts, lay it out. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1345.46s)]

*  There is one plausible explanation why the SEC hasn't gone after top Lehman executives. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1350.98s)]
*  As it turns out, some of Lehman's most egregious accounting shenanigans took place right under [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1356.86s)]
*  the noses of government regulators. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1362.22s)]
*  How closely was the SEC monitoring Lehman Brothers during this time? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1364.46s)]
*  They were on premises. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1368.78s)]
*  They were talking to the Lehman people daily. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1370.18s)]
*  They officed there. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1372.14s)]
*  It was not widely known at the time, but during the last six months of Lehman's existence, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1373.5800000000002s)]
*  teams of officials from the SEC and the Federal Reserve took up residence inside the firm [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1379.42s)]
*  to monitor its precarious financial situation. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1385.3000000000002s)]
*  They were inside the building when Matthew Lee wrote his letter to Lehman executives [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1388.7800000000002s)]
*  alleging unlawful accounting practices, and they were there when the practices took place. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1392.74s)]
*  Malouka says the SEC also knew that Lehman was being less than truthful when it said [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1399.9s)]
*  that it had enough assets to survive the crisis. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1405.26s)]
*  But that and other damaging information was never disclosed to investors, who continued [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1408.5800000000002s)]
*  to pump billions of dollars into the firm. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1413.38s)]
*  Should it have been disclosed? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1416.42s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1417.7800000000002s)]
*  Isn't the government, the SEC in this case, the people who were supposed to protect the [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1418.7800000000002s)]
*  investors? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1422.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1423.94s)]
*  Aren't they charged with informing investors? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1424.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1425.94s)]
*  Why didn't they do it? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1426.94s)]
*  They may not have had the expertise necessary to understand the material they were receiving. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1427.98s)]
*  They were getting the material whether they understood it is another question. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1432.3s)]
*  The very fact that government regulators were inside the company with access to its books [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1435.42s)]
*  and records would complicate any prosecution of Lehman officials. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1440.24s)]
*  Until four months ago, David Kotz was the SEC's inspector general. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1445.3s)]
*  Over the previous four years, he'd issued more than 100 reports about major deficiencies [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1449.68s)]
*  in the way the SEC did its job. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1455.02s)]
*  The SEC knew about some of these problems at Lehman Brothers and they weren't disclosed. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1458.06s)]
*  Doesn't it make it difficult for the SEC enforcement division to come back and bring action against [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1461.5s)]
*  Lehman Brothers? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1467.34s)]
*  They were there. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1468.34s)]
*  They saw it. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1469.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1470.34s)]
*  I think that that's definitely an impediment to a potential case. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1471.34s)]
*  And certainly if you go before a jury, the defense lawyers can make a big point about [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1473.98s)]
*  the fact that you were there, you knew about it, why didn't you do anything at the time? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1478.26s)]
*  Now you're coming after them. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1481.9s)]
*  In fact, former Lehman CEO Richard Fold seemed to be trying out that defense when he testified [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1483.5s)]
*  before Congress in 2008. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1488.94s)]
*  Throughout 2008, the SEC and the Federal Reserve conducted regular and at times daily oversight [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1491.7s)]
*  of our business and our balance sheet. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1498.14s)]
*  They saw what we saw in real time. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1500.86s)]
*  Let's just assume for a moment that Anton Veloukas' findings are true. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1503.54s)]
*  I mean, isn't this just a free ticket for executives to say, well look, you know, Lehman [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1508.1s)]
*  did so and so and nothing happened to them? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1514.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1516.1s)]
*  No, I think absolutely that's a serious problem. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1517.1s)]
*  I mean, obviously there has been a tremendous financial crisis. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1518.98s)]
*  The people who engaged in improper behavior need to be punished. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1522.78s)]
*  I think it's critical for the SEC to go after not just companies but also individuals where [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1526.26s)]
*  they have the evidence to do so. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1532.06s)]
*  When Lehman's bankruptcy was finally settled, there were claims against it for $370 billion. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1534.22s)]
*  The creditor settled for about 20 cents on the dollar. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1540.1000000000001s)]
*  Former CEO Richard Fold now runs a consulting business in Manhattan. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1543.78s)]
*  He lost most of his fortune and is embroiled in a raft of litigation but is still a wealthy [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1548.18s)]
*  man. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1553.5s)]
*  Most of his senior colleagues at Lehman have landed on their feet. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1554.5s)]
*  Ernst & Young, Lehman's accounting firm, is now being sued by New York State for aiding [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1558.26s)]
*  and abetting a fraud. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1563.18s)]
*  And Matthew Lee, the senior accountant who blew the whistle at Lehman, is still looking [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1565.18s)]
*  for work, unconvinced that much has changed in the world of finance over the last four [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1569.5s)]
*  years. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1574.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, the entrepreneurs of Wall Street are continually getting more and more sophisticated [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1575.8600000000001s)]
*  and they don't necessarily want regulators or auditors to fully understand what they're [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1579.38s)]
*  doing. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1583.38s)]
*  Do you believe the balance sheets of big Wall Street firms, if you read them now? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1584.38s)]
*  These numbers are so big and the financial instruments are so complex that, you know, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1587.68s)]
*  nobody stands a chance really of understanding. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1593.8s)]
*  I'd have more fun investing in crap tables in Las Vegas than Wall Street firms. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1596.3600000000001s)]
*  money. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1614.72s)]
*  And when they stop, as they have in recent months, the workings of our entire economy [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1615.72s)]
*  are threatened. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1620.24s)]
*  Credit became so frozen, the government had to step in this past week and take an ownership [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1621.96s)]
*  stake in the country's biggest banks. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1626.6000000000001s)]
*  On Monday, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson summoned the CEOs of the nine largest banks [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1629.38s)]
*  to Washington and gave them a massive amount of money so that they would start lending [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1634.16s)]
*  again. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1639.2s)]
*  The largest of the banks is Bank of America, now partly owned by the United States of America. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1640.64s)]
*  The head of Bank of America is Ken Lewis. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1648.24s)]
*  He says when he and the others met at the Treasury Department, it became clear that [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1651.42s)]
*  Secretary Paulson's offer was an ultimatum. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1655.5800000000002s)]
*  No negotiation was allowed. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1659.3200000000002s)]
*  No negotiations, no. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1661.6000000000001s)]
*  So in other words, take it or take it. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1663.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1665.0800000000002s)]
*  One of those. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1666.0800000000002s)]
*  It's said that he told the bankers and you, this is your patriotic duty. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1667.28s)]
*  I don't remember if he used the word, but there was an element to that, that this was [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1673.32s)]
*  the right thing for the American financial system and therefore it was the right thing [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1679.04s)]
*  for America. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1683.78s)]
*  Did you feel that? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1684.78s)]
*  Was that a persuasive line of argument? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1685.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1688.6399999999999s)]
*  I deeply believe that. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1689.6399999999999s)]
*  I think he was right on. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1691.1999999999998s)]
*  Explain why it was so important to the government that everybody agreed that the nine largest [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1692.8s)]
*  banks are all in this. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1698.64s)]
*  If you have a bank in that group that really, really needed the capital, you don't want [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1700.64s)]
*  to expose that bank. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1705.52s)]
*  In other words, stigmatize it so everybody knows that they're not as good as somebody [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1706.96s)]
*  else. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1711.3600000000001s)]
*  Most of you were just stunned by the amount of money that the government put on the table. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1712.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1716.4s)]
*  At least I was and I think most everybody else was. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1717.4s)]
*  The total was $125 billion of taxpayers' money. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1720.44s)]
*  Bank of America, Lewis says, didn't need the money but got $25 billion anyway. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1725.5s)]
*  Do you have any choice in this? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1731.0400000000002s)]
*  In other words, can you take the money and not lend? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1732.96s)]
*  We wouldn't want to do it that way because you can make more money lending and so the [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1736.0400000000002s)]
*  intent will be to use it to grow loans and to make more net income. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1741.74s)]
*  But under the Treasury plan, there's no requirement that a bank use the money to lend. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1747.24s)]
*  It could use it to acquire weaker competitors or put it in Treasury bills. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1752.28s)]
*  One of the few strings Paulson attached relates to salaries. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1757.74s)]
*  A bank would have to pay more taxes if it paid an executive over $500,000 a year. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1762.0s)]
*  One of the bankers in the meeting objected and started arguing with Paulson and that's [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1768.24s)]
*  when Ken Lewis, a critic of excessive executive compensation, spoke up. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1772.9s)]
*  I did make the point that we needed to stop talking about executive comp and get on with [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1777.8000000000002s)]
*  this because that should not stop the deal. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1782.1200000000001s)]
*  Actually, you're quoted as saying if this is what's going to stop this, you're out of [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1784.8600000000001s)]
*  your mind. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1789.5800000000002s)]
*  I did use the phrase out of your mind. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1790.94s)]
*  Because what? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1793.9s)]
*  Because you thought if it got out publicly that... [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1794.9s)]
*  I know that the importance of this deal getting done versus these elements of executive comp [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1796.74s)]
*  were just out of sync. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1803.78s)]
*  I mean, this was so much more important and all of us can take a little less money. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1804.78s)]
*  With his salary and lucrative stock and options, Lewis took home $25 million last year. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1811.36s)]
*  But he's one of the few in the business who can be fired without a golden parachute. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1818.42s)]
*  And he thinks executives on Wall Street have made too much money. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1823.66s)]
*  I think they were overpaid. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1827.5s)]
*  It's more egregious in financial services than any other industry that I know of. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1830.1000000000001s)]
*  We need to cut back compensation in this industry. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1834.74s)]
*  So this is a question everybody wants answered. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1838.3400000000001s)]
*  Is this socialism? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1842.0800000000002s)]
*  Have we now sort of stepped, taken a huge step away from the kind of freewheeling capitalism [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1843.8200000000002s)]
*  that we've known for the last 30 or so years? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1850.14s)]
*  I don't know what we'll call it, but it will be different. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1853.02s)]
*  And there will be more regulation. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1855.62s)]
*  The golden era of financial services is over, in my opinion. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1857.3s)]
*  But why isn't it socialism? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1861.62s)]
*  If the government starts owning our banks... [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1864.02s)]
*  And that will not last forever. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1867.02s)]
*  We will pay off the preferred stock at some point and come back to not being owned partially [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1869.46s)]
*  by the government. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1875.86s)]
*  Can you give us your sense of how long it's going to take? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1876.9s)]
*  I think somewhere between three and five years we'll pay it off. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1879.42s)]
*  And then you go back to more toward capitalism. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1882.58s)]
*  It's said that one of the main reasons the bank is doing well is because of your decision [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1887.1s)]
*  not to get into subprime mortgages. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1892.1399999999999s)]
*  In 2001, my first year as CEO, we decided that we just didn't like the business. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1895.78s)]
*  It was too risky. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1901.74s)]
*  And so we decided to get out of it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1902.74s)]
*  He makes it sound like a routine decision, but getting out of most of the financial products [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1904.62s)]
*  that brought Wall Street crashing down was significant. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1909.28s)]
*  And now Lewis runs one of the country's healthiest banks, which just keeps growing. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1912.92s)]
*  We saw the strongest growth in deposits in the third quarter we've ever seen in our [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1917.86s)]
*  history. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1922.56s)]
*  He told us that during this crisis, people are taking their money out of other banks [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1923.56s)]
*  and putting it in his. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1927.44s)]
*  We bank every other American family in America. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1929.48s)]
*  You what? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1932.04s)]
*  We bank every other American family in the United States. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1933.04s)]
*  No. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1936.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1937.3999999999999s)]
*  We bank every other American family. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1938.4s)]
*  He does business with us in some form or fashion. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1939.4s)]
*  You mean credit cards, auto loans, deposits? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1942.44s)]
*  Checking accounts, exactly. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1944.6000000000001s)]
*  Checking. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1945.6000000000001s)]
*  Half the country. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1946.6000000000001s)]
*  The way B of A accomplished this was by buying the number one company in virtually every [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1948.0s)]
*  category of banking. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1953.64s)]
*  For instance, it bought Countrywide in mortgages and MBNA in credit cards. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1955.76s)]
*  Now it's a nearly $3 trillion conglomerate, the Walmart of banking. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1962.08s)]
*  This is the iconic image of Wall Street, 600 Wheeler dealers buying and selling. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1968.78s)]
*  But this is B of A's trading floor, and it's 600 miles south of New York. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1975.36s)]
*  The biggest bank in America is headquartered in Charlotte? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1981.12s)]
*  Some people don't even know what state Charlotte's in, whether it's North or South Carolina. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1984.76s)]
*  Am I insulting you? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1989.32s)]
*  No. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1990.68s)]
*  In fact, I always say Charlotte, North Carolina, so I don't have to ask the question. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1991.68s)]
*  You have this building, this building, that building, that building, then there's one [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=1997.0800000000002s)]
*  next to us, that building. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2001.92s)]
*  Not surprisingly, B of A seems to own Charlotte, and the town grew with the bank. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2004.2s)]
*  Hugh McCall was the bank's CEO before Lewis. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2010.5600000000002s)]
*  It started out as a relatively small regional bank. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2013.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, we didn't like being small. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2017.92s)]
*  I mean, there's nothing really attractive about being small. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2019.52s)]
*  He set out to expand the bank's reach from coast to coast and make Charlotte a financial [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2023.12s)]
*  powerhouse. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2028.32s)]
*  I think we have this sort of southern underdog of wanting to be masters of our own fate and [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2029.56s)]
*  not be dependent on Northern capital. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2035.4s)]
*  When you were growing and you'd go to New York, did they not treat you well? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2038.36s)]
*  Is that, did they treat you like sort of the country bumpkins? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2043.08s)]
*  I guess when I was a young man, I always felt a little uncomfortable in New York. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2047.12s)]
*  This uncomfortable feeling that they weren't respecting you, did you have it in your head, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2051.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm going to conquer New York? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2056.64s)]
*  Well, that would overstate New York. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2058.88s)]
*  I was more interested in America. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2061.7999999999997s)]
*  Did you really think that you could overtake Wall Street? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2064.56s)]
*  Well, have you ever played tennis? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2068.12s)]
*  Once you size up the competition and decide whether you can beat him or not, hey. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2070.52s)]
*  And you thought you could? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2074.68s)]
*  I thought I could. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2075.68s)]
*  They did. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2076.96s)]
*  The crowning victory came last month when Wall Street's most famous investment houses [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2078.52s)]
*  were collapsing under the weight of their toxic portfolios and needed rescuing. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2083.1600000000003s)]
*  They went hat in hand to Charlotte, North Carolina. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2088.6400000000003s)]
*  Everybody thought you were going to buy Lehman Brothers. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2093.4s)]
*  Friday night, that was the buzz. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2095.6400000000003s)]
*  Monday morning. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2097.84s)]
*  It's not Lehman Brothers, it's Merrill Lynch. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2101.1600000000003s)]
*  What happened between Friday night and Monday morning? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2103.84s)]
*  I had talked to Secretary Paulson that Friday and basically said we didn't think we could [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2106.48s)]
*  do the deal without government assistance. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2113.8s)]
*  With Lehman? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2115.96s)]
*  With Lehman. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2116.96s)]
*  We couldn't do it without some help. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2117.96s)]
*  And then about 10.30, John Thane called. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2120.36s)]
*  It was Saturday morning, September 13th. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2124.0s)]
*  John Thane, the CEO of Merrill Lynch, was on the line. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2126.6s)]
*  Lehman was on its deathbed. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2130.8s)]
*  Merrill Lynch was said to be next. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2132.32s)]
*  You always wanted Merrill Lynch. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2135.0s)]
*  We've always thought that was the best. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2136.52s)]
*  You were drooling for Merrill Lynch. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2138.0s)]
*  We have always thought it was. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2139.44s)]
*  Deals of this magnitude take months of due diligence and vetting. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2141.64s)]
*  This deal was thrown together over a weekend, with Bank of America spending $50 billion [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2146.44s)]
*  to buy one of Wall Street's emblematic companies. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2152.64s)]
*  But now B of A is exposed to Merrill Lynch's poisonous investments and continuing losses. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2156.16s)]
*  The question is, did Ken Lewis pay too much? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2162.4s)]
*  Some think that we should have waited until Monday and see if they would have gone bankrupt. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2166.14s)]
*  You're saying that if you'd waited, they might have gone bankrupt. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2170.48s)]
*  Some think we would have gotten it for dirt cheap. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2174.6800000000003s)]
*  But my point is you would have had a tarnished brand. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2177.88s)]
*  You would have had chaos. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2180.36s)]
*  You would have had a court ruling over all of the sale of assets. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2181.64s)]
*  And it was worth it to us to pay a more market price so that we could not have that happen. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2186.0s)]
*  So what about Merrill's 17,000 brokers? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2194.12s)]
*  Lewis has said their salaries are too high. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2197.8s)]
*  Is New York going to lose a lot of jobs, do you think? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2200.28s)]
*  I don't think a lot. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2203.24s)]
*  I mean, obviously we have to, we've got $7 billion of call savings to get. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2204.24s)]
*  So that means that there will be jobs eliminated. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2208.6s)]
*  $7 billion? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2211.04s)]
*  $7 billion in call savings. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2212.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2214.0s)]
*  So the government's rescue isn't helping everyone on Wall Street. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2215.16s)]
*  What about Main Street? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2219.52s)]
*  Has the lending started? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2221.3199999999997s)]
*  Did this jump start lending again? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2222.64s)]
*  It should. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2225.04s)]
*  It's only been a few days, obviously. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2226.04s)]
*  And it will make a big difference. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2228.68s)]
*  We're sitting down with you Wednesday. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2230.64s)]
*  The market is at this moment going down again. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2233.2799999999997s)]
*  The market's going down. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2235.8799999999997s)]
*  And what's worrying me is the fact that we've gotten the financial system in much, much [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2237.2s)]
*  better shape. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2241.54s)]
*  But the economy is still a question mark. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2242.7s)]
*  And we are in a recession by any standard other than maybe some technical standard. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2246.2599999999998s)]
*  It feels like a recession. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2251.04s)]
*  And we think it's going to take some time before it gets better. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2252.74s)]

*  One of the best guides to the danger ahead is Whitney Tilson. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2380.18s)]

*  investors who manage about ten billion dollars gathered to hear him last week. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2388.3399999999997s)]
*  Tilson saw a year ago that subprime mortgages were just the start. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2393.8599999999997s)]
*  We had the greatest asset bubble in history and now that bubble is bursting. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2398.8599999999997s)]
*  The single biggest piece of the bubble is the U.S. mortgage market and we're probably [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2403.3399999999997s)]
*  about halfway through the unwinding and bursting of that bubble. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2408.8599999999997s)]
*  Halfway. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2413.7s)]
*  It may seem like all the carnage out there, we must be almost finished, but there's still [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2414.7s)]
*  a lot of pain to come in terms of write downs and losses that have yet to be recognized. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2418.74s)]
*  In 2007, Tilson teamed up with Amherst Securities, an investment firm that specializes in mortgages. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2424.9799999999996s)]
*  Amherst had done some financial detective work analyzing the millions of mortgages that [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2432.1s)]
*  were bundled into those mortgage-backed securities that Wall Street was peddling. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2437.54s)]
*  It found that the subprimes, loans to the least creditworthy borrowers, were defaulting. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2442.86s)]
*  But Amherst also ran the numbers on what were supposed to be higher quality mortgages. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2448.52s)]
*  And they were frankly terrifying as data we'd never seen before and that's what made us [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2454.74s)]
*  realize holy cow, things are going to be much worse than anyone anticipates. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2458.82s)]
*  The trouble now is that the insanity didn't end with the subprimes. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2463.52s)]
*  There were two other kinds of exotic mortgages that became popular called alt-A's and option [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2467.88s)]
*  arms. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2473.48s)]
*  The option arms in particular lured borrowers in with ultra-low initial interest rates called [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2474.52s)]
*  teaser rates, sometimes as low as 1%. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2480.96s)]
*  But after two, three or five years, those rates reset. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2484.64s)]
*  They went up and so did the monthly payment. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2488.72s)]
*  So a mortgage of say $800 a month could easily jump to $1,500. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2491.64s)]
*  Now the alt-A and option arm loans made back in the heyday are starting to reset, causing [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2498.8399999999997s)]
*  the mortgage payments to go up and homeowners to default. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2505.2799999999997s)]
*  The defaults right now are incredibly high at unprecedented levels and there's no evidence [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2509.24s)]
*  that the default rate is tapering off. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2515.52s)]
*  Those defaults almost inevitably are leading to foreclosures and homes being auctioned [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2517.6s)]
*  and home prices continuing to fall. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2521.98s)]
*  What you seem to be saying is that there is a very predictable time bomb effect here. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2524.2799999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2529.2s)]
*  You can look back at what was written in 05 and 07. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2530.2s)]
*  You can look at the reset dates. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2534.22s)]
*  You can look at the current default rates and it's really very clear and predictable [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2536.12s)]
*  what's going to happen here. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2541.7599999999998s)]
*  Let's look at this projection from the Investment Bank of Credit Suisse. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2543.52s)]
*  These are the billions of dollars in subprime mortgages that reset last year and this year. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2548.36s)]
*  Now look at what hasn't hit yet. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2554.6s)]
*  The alt-A and option arm resets when homeowners will pay higher interest rates in the next [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2557.14s)]
*  three years. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2563.48s)]
*  We're at the beginning of a second wave. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2564.48s)]
*  How big is the potential damage from the alt-A's compared to what we just saw in the subprimes? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2567.86s)]
*  Well the subprime was approaching a trillion. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2573.4s)]
*  The alt-A is about a trillion and then you have option arms on top of that. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2575.6800000000003s)]
*  That's probably another five to six hundred billion on top of that. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2580.7200000000003s)]
*  How many of these option arms would you imagine are going to fail? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2583.64s)]
*  Well north of fifty percent. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2587.32s)]
*  My gut would be seventy percent of these option arms will default. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2588.8s)]
*  How do you know that? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2592.76s)]
*  We know it based on current default rates and this is before the reset. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2593.76s)]
*  So people are defaulting even on the little three percent teaser interest only rates they're [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2598.76s)]
*  being asked to pay today. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2603.6600000000003s)]

*  What role did these exotic mortgages play, these Alte's and the option arms? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2742.8799999999997s)]
*  They were essential. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2747.0s)]
*  They were necessary without the Alte or option arm mortgage. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2748.0s)]
*  This boom never would have occurred. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2751.12s)]
*  It never would have occurred because without the Alte's and the option arms, many buyers [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2752.52s)]
*  never would have qualified for a loan. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2756.52s)]
*  The banks and the brokers were getting their money up front in fees. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2758.9199999999996s)]
*  So the more they wrote, the more they made. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2763.12s)]
*  They stopped checking whether the income was even real. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2765.9599999999996s)]
*  They turned to low and no-doc loans, so-called liars loans, and jokingly referred to as ninja [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2768.52s)]
*  loans. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2773.96s)]
*  No income, no job, no assets. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2774.96s)]
*  And they were still willing to lend. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2775.96s)]
*  But help me out here. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2777.2s)]
*  How does that make sense for the lender? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2778.2s)]
*  It would seem to be reckless in the extreme. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2780.64s)]
*  It was, but the key assumption underlying the willingness to do this was that home prices [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2784.08s)]
*  would keep going up forever. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2789.4s)]
*  And in fact, home prices nationwide had never declined since the Great Depression. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2790.96s)]
*  On the way up, everyone wanted in. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2795.62s)]
*  No one expected to feel any pain. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2797.88s)]
*  People like acupuncturist Rula Geosmus became real estate speculators. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2800.84s)]
*  How many properties did you buy in this last five-year period? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2806.2000000000003s)]
*  I believe in the last five-year period I bought about six properties. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2809.4s)]
*  And what did you buy them for? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2812.84s)]
*  For investments. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2814.44s)]
*  She says she put 20% down on each. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2815.5200000000004s)]
*  Now they're all financed with option arm loans. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2818.32s)]
*  What did you understand about the loans? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2821.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, I didn't ask too many questions. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2823.28s)]
*  In the old days I would shop around, but because of the frenzy and I was so busy looking [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2825.88s)]
*  to buy other properties, I didn't really focus on shopping around for mortgage brokers. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2830.12s)]
*  But if you're investing in real estate, you're buying multiple properties, you should be [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2834.56s)]
*  asking a lot of questions. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2839.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2840.32s)]
*  Why didn't you ask? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2841.32s)]
*  I was busy. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2842.32s)]
*  I was really busy looking at property all the time, all day long. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2843.32s)]
*  Did you read the paperwork? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2847.0s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2848.0s)]
*  Now she's losing money on every property. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2850.0s)]
*  You know that there are people watching this interview who are saying, you know, she was [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2852.84s)]
*  just foolish. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2856.6800000000003s)]
*  She was greedy and foolish. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2858.4s)]
*  She was buying small apartment buildings and wasn't paying enough attention to how they [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2859.84s)]
*  were financed. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2864.28s)]
*  My full-time job is I'm an acupuncturist. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2865.36s)]
*  So this is just a side thing. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2867.2000000000003s)]
*  You're an acupuncturist, but you got stuck in real estate. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2869.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2872.08s)]
*  Geosmith says she was misled and she hopes to renegotiate her loans. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2873.08s)]
*  But many other buyers have simply walked away from their properties. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2877.7200000000003s)]
*  This Miami luxury building was a sellout, but when we visited, a quarter of the condos [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2882.32s)]
*  were in foreclosure. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2888.28s)]
*  What did this place go for? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2889.28s)]
*  This was originally purchased in October of 2006 for $2.4 million. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2891.1200000000003s)]
*  $2.4 million? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2894.84s)]
*  What's it worth now? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2895.84s)]
*  The asking price from the lender is $9.39. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2897.32s)]
*  So it lost a million and a half dollars in value in a couple of years? [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2900.2400000000002s)]
*  It was a tough two years. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2903.36s)]
*  And there are tough years to come, because just like the subprimes, the Alt-A and Option [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2906.1600000000003s)]

*  Miserable. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2919.44s)]
*  2010. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2920.44s)]
*  Miserable. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2921.44s)]

*  central is that to what happens to the rest of the economy? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2939.04s)]
*  It's core. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2942.16s)]
*  It's core because housing is such an important part. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2943.16s)]
*  We're not going to get the housing industry back on track until we clear out this garbage [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2947.64s)]

*  this year. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2975.12s)]
*  You have the massive supply out there of units that need to be sold. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2977.04s)]
*  With the housing supply increasing that much, what does it mean? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2982.88s)]
*  It means that this problem, the economic difficulties, are not going to be resolved in a short period [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2986.48s)]
*  of time. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSCnYPyb1A&t=2993.56s)]
