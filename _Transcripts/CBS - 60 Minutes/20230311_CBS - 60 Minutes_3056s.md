*  We name fancy cars and sports teams after them, but precious few people have ever seen [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=0.0s)]
*  a jaguar in the wild. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=18.16s)]
*  They don't live in the United States anymore and can only be found in the sweltering jungles [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=20.2s)]
*  of Central and South America. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  But just try to find one. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=27.72s)]
*  They hunt by night and sleep by day, comfortably concealed in thick, dark brush. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=29.92s)]
*  It's because of their elusive nature, their power and their beauty, that jaguars have [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  long been worshipped by tribes as demigods, whose real home is a spiritual world which [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=40.56s)]
*  man cannot even fathom. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  But whichever world they frequent, they only emerge briefly during the dry season when [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=48.96s)]
*  they go down to rivers to drink. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  So when it got dry in September, and Alan Rabinowitz, the world's foremost authority [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=55.9s)]
*  on jaguars, invited us to go with him to some far-flung wetlands in Brazil, near the Bolivian [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=60.54s)]
*  border, we picked up the phone and booked our flights. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=66.66s)]
*  We headed towards an unspoiled remote area called the Pantanal, where the temperature [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=73.42s)]
*  rarely dipped below 115 degrees. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=78.78s)]
*  We had to cross more than 125 rustic wooden bridges over dried-up ponds and lakes, home [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=83.10000000000001s)]
*  to piranhas and caimans, cousins to the crocodile. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=90.16s)]
*  It was good to be in a car. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=95.26s)]
*  We started our search for jaguars on the Cuiabá River with Alan Rabinowitz, the CEO of Panthera, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=97.42s)]
*  the new conservation group. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  He told us that jaguars are very fast and have been known to kill people. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=106.9s)]
*  It was good to be in a boat. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=111.88s)]
*  Rabinowitz has been studying a cat's migration routes and habitats in the jungle for 30 years, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=114.28s)]
*  but he has gone months without seeing a single one. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=120.64s)]
*  His advice to us? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=123.84s)]
*  Get lucky. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=126.56s)]
*  It takes hours and hours of doing this because even when they're out there, it's almost [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=127.56s)]
*  needle in a haystack. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=133.16s)]
*  Even though this is the dentist's highest concentration of jaguars matching any place [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  on earth, there's still a limited number of jaguars here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=138.84s)]
*  But luck was a lady that day. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=143.36s)]
*  It wasn't long before we caught our first glimpse, and it was just a glimpse, of a young [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=145.36s)]
*  jaguar sitting on the riverbank behind that fallen tree. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=151.32s)]
*  If you can't see him clearly, well, neither could we. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=155.56s)]
*  But Rabinowitz? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  His head is right there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  See it? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  He got it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  See it? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  Isn't that something? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=169.44s)]
*  This gives you the real gut feel of the secretive nature of this animal. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=170.44s)]
*  There's no sign of defeat in its face. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=174.16s)]
*  At dawn the next day, we went looking for jaguars again. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=183.64s)]
*  One of our spotters tried to tempt the cats out of the jungle, but his simulated mating [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=189.56s)]
*  call just didn't do it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=195.0s)]
*  But it might have appealed to anacondas. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=201.04s)]
*  This fellow was medium sized, according to the spotters, nine feet long. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=203.96s)]
*  Then we went up a small river that looked like an aquatic garden of Eden. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=210.28s)]
*  No jaguars here either, but an extraordinary assembly of birds and others. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=219.2s)]
*  We saw a family of very rare giant river otters basking in the sun after a morning of fishing [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=229.16s)]
*  and swimming. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=235.56s)]
*  We saw the world's largest rodents, unflappable 100 pound capybaras, a favorite dish of jaguars. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  Jaguars like caiman as well. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=246.0s)]
*  This caiman was having lunch. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=248.2s)]
*  This one had been somebody else's lunch, probably a jaguars. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=249.95999999999998s)]
*  Small, but a young jaguar. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=254.2s)]
*  Photographer Steve Winter has been a jaguar groupie for years and was helping us look [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=259.2s)]
*  for the cats. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=264.24s)]
*  He has shot what could be the finest jaguar portraits ever taken. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  They weren't easy to come by. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=271.84s)]
*  I spent the first three months in the jungle and got a big fat zero. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=274.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=279.8s)]
*  No cats. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=280.8s)]
*  Three months? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=281.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=282.8s)]
*  How did you feel about that? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=283.8s)]
*  I felt like my career was over. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=284.8s)]
*  We were beginning to feel the same way. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=286.64s)]
*  So we headed out again at night. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=290.2s)]
*  Our spotters told us that they could see the reflection of their lights in the eyes of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=292.36s)]
*  a jaguar a hundred yards away. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=296.28s)]
*  We were skeptical. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=298.84s)]
*  We were wrong. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=301.8s)]
*  That's like 80 to 85 kilos. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  And that's a relatively small jaguar in this area. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  Look at her. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  God, she's beautiful. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh man, and when she looks right at you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  It's one of those beautiful things I've heard. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=323.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  This was great sighting. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  But the best was yet to come. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=328.8s)]
*  A few minutes later, we happened to be there as a jaguar swam from one side of the river [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=331.8s)]
*  to the other. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  It was a once in a lifetime shot in the dark. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=338.8s)]
*  This is a rare sight. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=341.8s)]
*  I've never caught them in the water. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=343.8s)]
*  I've never gotten it in the water before. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=345.8s)]
*  That was a young one. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=347.8s)]
*  Dr. Alan Rabinowitz, zoologist, scholar, scientist, was as excited as a kid at the zoo. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=349.8s)]
*  Perhaps more excited. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=357.8s)]
*  That was spectacular. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=360.8s)]
*  I've never seen that before. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=361.8s)]
*  What luck. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=362.8s)]
*  What unbelievable luck. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=363.8s)]
*  Just as it's swimming across. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=364.8s)]
*  There was no fear there. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=367.8s)]
*  It was just pure curiosity. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=369.8s)]
*  Like, what are you guys bothering me about? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=371.8s)]
*  Maybe we had bothered her because she disappeared. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=375.8s)]
*  But then it seems she got curious again. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=378.8s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=383.8s)]
*  Just sitting up there on the mat. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=384.8s)]
*  That's phenomenal. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=386.8s)]
*  She looked a little sleepy or confused. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=387.8s)]
*  But there she was, the diva, perfectly lit, taking her curtain call. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=390.8s)]
*  It was hard to imagine that this lovely starlet was really a ferocious predator [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=395.8s)]
*  who sinks her fangs into the skull of her prey, killing it instantly. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=401.8s)]
*  We were beginning to understand why jaguars were viewed as otherworldly beings [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=406.8s)]
*  by the tribes that used to live here. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=410.8s)]
*  Because he's a creature of the night, his real home is said to be the underworld, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=414.8s)]
*  which he dominates just as he dominates the jungle. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=419.8s)]
*  Killing a jaguar is believed by some tribes as being equivalent to killing an ancestor [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=423.8s)]
*  and is said to condemn the killer to eternal damnation. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=428.8s)]
*  That myth has helped the jaguar survive. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=432.8s)]
*  And in the strangest way, jaguars helped Alan Rabinowitz survive. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=436.8s)]
*  It all began with a debilitating condition he suffered through, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=441.8s)]
*  even before he knew what a jaguar was. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=445.8s)]
*  When I was a young child, I couldn't speak. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=448.8s)]
*  I had a severe, severe stutter. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=453.8s)]
*  You literally couldn't talk? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=455.8s)]
*  I could talk, but I had severe blocks. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=457.8s)]
*  My whole body would spasm. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=460.8s)]
*  My mouth would close shut. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=462.8s)]
*  And back then, unlike now, they thought it was completely psychological. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=464.8s)]
*  Now we know it's more genetic. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=469.8s)]
*  So they would put me in special classes. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=471.8s)]
*  They would put me in what all the kids called the retarded classes. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=473.8s)]
*  And I just stopped trying. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=476.8s)]
*  I stopped even trying to speak to the human world. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=478.8s)]
*  What I could do, stutterers can sing without stuttering, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=481.8s)]
*  and I couldn't sing very well. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=485.8s)]
*  And stutterers can speak to animals. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=487.8s)]
*  And every day, I'd come home from school, and I'd go into my closet, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=489.8s)]
*  because I loved being in the dark, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=494.8s)]
*  and I'd speak to my green turtles or chameleons or lizards or garter snakes. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=496.8s)]
*  If I was having a particularly bad week at school, which often happened, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=501.8s)]
*  my father would take me to the Bronx Zoo. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=505.8s)]
*  And that's where his fascination, his obsession, began, in the Bronx Zoo. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=508.8s)]
*  One pitiful lone jaguar sat in the great cat house. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=514.8s)]
*  It was big. It was powerful. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=517.8s)]
*  And it was all alone. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=521.8s)]
*  And I was so incredibly attracted to that one lone jaguar, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=523.8s)]
*  I would make my father stay back, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=527.8s)]
*  and I would lean over towards the bars, and I would start talking. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=530.8s)]
*  You talked to the jaguar. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=533.8s)]
*  I did talk to the jaguar. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=534.8s)]
*  Do you remember what you said? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=536.8s)]
*  I would say how people are stupid, how they don't understand me clearly [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=537.8s)]
*  the same way they don't understand you, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=541.8s)]
*  how they're locking you up in this cage the way I'm locked up in my own head. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=543.8s)]
*  Those are the things I would talk about to the jaguar. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=547.8s)]
*  I made a promise over and over again that if I ever got my voice back, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=551.8s)]
*  that somehow I would help that animal, help that jaguar, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=556.8s)]
*  help these animals like him. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=561.8s)]
*  Nolan Rabinowitz has kept his promise. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=563.8s)]
*  Devotion to jaguars became his religion. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=566.8s)]
*  Before he got married, he lived alone in the jungle just to be close to jaguars, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=569.8s)]
*  doing then what he does now, learning more about them every day. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=574.8s)]
*  Setting up traps like this one, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=579.8s)]
*  so that he can attach radio collars to their necks. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=582.8s)]
*  One night, Alan and his team snared this young lady and put her to sleep for a while. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=586.8s)]
*  This is the same cat we saw swimming this afternoon, isn't it? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=592.8s)]
*  It's likely. It looks as if it probably is. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=595.8s)]
*  The team monitored the jaguar's vital signs, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=599.8s)]
*  took a blood sample, and put a GPS unit around her neck. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=602.8s)]
*  It's through the data of a few animals like this [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=607.8s)]
*  that we're able to be saving this whole species. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=611.8s)]
*  And here's a jaguar we saw from the sky. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=615.8s)]
*  The data Rabinowitz has collected showed him that jaguars instinctively travel great distances, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=619.8s)]
*  sometimes hundreds of miles. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=625.8s)]
*  Trouble is, they can't anymore. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=627.8s)]
*  Cattle ranches now interrupt their old roaming routes, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=630.8s)]
*  and ranchers kill jaguars because jaguars eat their cattle. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=634.8s)]
*  That's where billionaire Tom Kaplan, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=639.8s)]
*  the co-founder of Panthera, the outfit trying to save jaguars, comes in. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=642.8s)]
*  He's buying up ranches and telling the ranchers, his employees now, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=647.8s)]
*  to lay off the jaguars. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=652.8s)]
*  To make sure they understand that there's been a change of ownership, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=654.8s)]
*  he's introduced a new branding iron. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=657.8s)]
*  The paw print of a jaguar. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=661.8s)]
*  He's also winning them over the old-fashioned way, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=666.8s)]
*  improving their lives, building schools and clinics. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=669.8s)]
*  There is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=673.8s)]
*  hey, wait a minute, our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=678.8s)]
*  When you show that, you've won their hearts and you've won their minds, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=685.8s)]
*  and then you've won the war. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=689.8s)]
*  Alan Rabinowitz wants the jaguars to be able to roam freely again, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=692.8s)]
*  so he's working with governments as well as ranchers [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=696.8s)]
*  to protect what he calls jaguar corridors. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=699.8s)]
*  They connect to different isolated areas where the catch is still thriving. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=702.8s)]
*  He gets to these areas sometimes, and sometimes he gets too close. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=707.8s)]
*  How far away are you from him? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=712.8s)]
*  I would say about 20 feet. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=714.8s)]
*  20 feet? And he is standing, sitting, lying? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=717.8s)]
*  He was standing. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=720.8s)]
*  Then probably within a few seconds I realized this is dangerous, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=721.8s)]
*  and I fell. Of course, what more could happen? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=724.8s)]
*  So I fell backwards thinking, okay, if you want to kill me, now's the time. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=728.8s)]
*  I'm on my back, and the jaguar just stood up and started walking off into the jungle. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=733.8s)]
*  Not very far away, but this is what I'll never forget. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=739.8s)]
*  I'll never forget. It turned back to me. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=743.8s)]
*  It gave a low growl. It wasn't an aggressive growl. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=746.8s)]
*  It just gave kind of a low growling sound, and it looked at me. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=750.8s)]
*  And I looked at it, and I could look at its eyes now with no fear. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=754.8s)]
*  And I said to it, I said out loud, we're okay now. We're going to be okay. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=759.8s)]
*  Alan Rabinowitz can only hope he'll be okay. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=768.8s)]
*  He conquered his stutter, but now he's fighting leukemia [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=771.8s)]
*  and doesn't know how much longer he'll be able to stay in the jungle. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=775.8s)]
*  But before we left, he told us he was happy that after his 30 years of devotion, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=779.8s)]
*  we'd be introducing so many of his friends on 60 Minutes. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=785.8s)]
*  Can you imagine an orphanage that's a happy place? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=801.8s)]
*  We couldn't, but then we found one. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=806.8s)]
*  The kids don't arrive here smiling like orphans all over the world. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=809.8s)]
*  They've been abandoned. They're hungry, sad, and desperate. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=813.8s)]
*  But after a few years, they're healthy, well-fed, and, well, happy. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=817.8s)]
*  The orphanage is in Kenya, outside Nairobi. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=822.8s)]
*  And we might as well tell you now, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=825.8s)]
*  It's an orphanage for elephants. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=828.8s)]
*  They've been orphaned because their parents, their mothers mainly, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=830.8s)]
*  have died or more likely been killed in the bush. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=834.8s)]
*  Poachers kill large elephants for their ivory. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=838.8s)]
*  A young elephant can only survive a day or two without milk. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=841.8s)]
*  So the orphanage's first job is to find the orphans, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=844.8s)]
*  fly them to the orphanage, and before anything else, feed them. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=848.8s)]
*  The principle of the orphanage, by the way, is that [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=853.8s)]
*  The principle of the orphanage, the principal, headmistress, head nurse, and CEO, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=856.8s)]
*  is Dame Daphne Sheldrick. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=861.8s)]
*  She founded the place, has been working with elephants for 50 years. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=863.8s)]
*  This is little Seguta. This is the one that was in a coma when she arrived. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=868.8s)]
*  Was on a drip for 24 hours. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=872.8s)]
*  We never thought she'd be alive in the morning. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=876.8s)]
*  So she's our little miracle, this one. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=879.8s)]
*  But Daphne's problem is that she's caring for too many miracles. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=881.8s)]
*  Poachers are killing more and more elephants for their tusks, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=885.8s)]
*  creating more and more orphans. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=888.8s)]
*  There's a record number of orphans here right now because, Daphne says, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=891.8s)]
*  the sale of ivory has been legalized for the first time in 10 years. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=895.8s)]
*  A few African countries have been given the right to sell their ivory stockpiles [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=899.8s)]
*  more than 100 tons of tusks to China and Japan. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=904.8s)]
*  And conservationists point out this is yet another blow to Africa's elephants. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=908.8s)]
*  Do you see any correlation between the decision to auction off the ivory [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=914.8s)]
*  and the number of orphans? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=919.8s)]
*  We do. Every time ivory is auctioned legally, there's a rise in poaching. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=921.8s)]
*  And we also see the correlation in the price that's paid to the poacher for illegal ivory. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=926.8s)]
*  Is the price going up? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=931.8s)]
*  It's gone from 300 shillings a kilo to 5,000. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=933.8s)]
*  That's about $1,000 a tusk. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=936.8s)]
*  And in Kenya, the number of elephants killed by poachers [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=939.8s)]
*  has increased by 45% this year alone. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=942.8s)]
*  A rather amazing rise, isn't it? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=946.8s)]
*  It is. It's a scary, frightening rise. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=948.8s)]
*  Poachers were behind the death of this elephant. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=951.8s)]
*  Her trunk was caught in one of their snares, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=954.8s)]
*  and she had no way of feeding herself or her six-week-old baby boy. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=956.8s)]
*  He just couldn't accept the fact that his mother was dead, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=961.8s)]
*  so he continued trying to suckle. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=964.8s)]
*  Eventually, the keepers got him to drink their milk. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=967.8s)]
*  They called him Shumba, and he was in such bad shape [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=970.8s)]
*  that nobody thought he would survive. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=973.8s)]
*  But then he was brought to the orphanage, and things began going his way. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=976.8s)]
*  He's 27 months old now and is in very good shape, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=981.8s)]
*  very muscular, very strong, and he's beginning to grow tusks. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=984.8s)]
*  He never stops eating. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=988.8s)]
*  In fact, that's the first love of every orphan here, eating. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=990.8s)]
*  The institution has a dining area, and that's not all. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=994.8s)]
*  As we found out when we first dropped by here three years ago, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=998.8s)]
*  it has everything you'd want in an orphanage, dormitories. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1001.8s)]
*  Each orphan has a private room, a communal bath, and a playground. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1005.8s)]
*  The regimen at the orphanage is anything but Dickensian. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1010.8s)]
*  Unlike Oliver Twist, when one of these orphans asks for more, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1014.8s)]
*  that's what he gets, more. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1018.8s)]
*  Ultimately, Daphne finds elephants more sympathetic than people. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1020.8s)]
*  What is the most extraordinary thing you have learned about elephants? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1024.8s)]
*  Their tremendous capacity for caring is, I think, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1028.8s)]
*  perhaps the most amazing thing about them, even at a very, very young age. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1032.8s)]
*  They're sort of forgiveness, unselfishness. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1037.8s)]
*  So, you know, I often say, as I think I've said before, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1041.8s)]
*  they have all the best attributes of us humans [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1044.8s)]
*  and not very many of the bad. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1047.8s)]
*  Just about the best people you've ever met are the gentlemen who work here. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1050.8s)]
*  Keepers, they're called, and they have extraordinary jobs. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1054.8s)]
*  There is one keeper per elephant. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1057.8s)]
*  He'll spend 24 hours a day with his charge, seven days a week. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1059.8s)]
*  The keeper feeds his elephant every three hours, day and night, just like Mom would. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1063.8s)]
*  He keeps his elephant warm, not like Mom would, but with a blanket. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1068.8s)]
*  And when it's sleep time, he beds down right next to his elephant. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1072.8s)]
*  If he leaves, if ever so briefly, the baby wakes up and broadcasts his displeasure. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1076.8s)]
*  The keepers are rotated now and then [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1082.8s)]
*  so that no elephant gets too terribly attached to any one of them. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1085.8s)]
*  At dawn, the elephants are taken from their dorms out to the bush. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1093.8s)]
*  They hang out for a while, play some games. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1097.8s)]
*  Up, up, up, up, up, up, up. Come on, here. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1100.8s)]
*  Soccer is a favorite. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1104.8s)]
*  Come on, come on, come on, come on. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1106.8s)]
*  And guess who decides when it's halftime. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1108.8s)]
*  The days are pretty much the same here, but on Fridays, the orphanage becomes a spa. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1114.8s)]
*  You want to rub her down? Go on, rub her down. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1120.8s)]
*  The keepers give the elephants a coconut oil massage. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1125.8s)]
*  We can't do exactly what the mother can do, but we do something close to that. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1130.8s)]
*  You're a surrogate mother. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1134.8s)]
*  Edwin Lucichi is the head of the keepers. He is the chief elephant man. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1136.8s)]
*  This one here is Lwaleni. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1141.8s)]
*  Lwaleni is the oldest female we have, 16 months as well. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1144.8s)]
*  The tiny one here is Makena. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1149.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1154.8s)]
*  Always want to be close with Lwaleni. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1155.8s)]
*  Yes, well, they always want to be close to each other and to you, don't they? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1158.8s)]
*  I'm afraid this interview with Edwin is getting rudely interrupted. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1164.8s)]
*  But there's really not that much to do. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1168.8s)]
*  There may be little, there may be orphans, but trust me, they're not as little as they look. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1170.8s)]
*  In fact, I feel like I'm in an elephant sandwich. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1175.8s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1178.8s)]
*  Perhaps the problem was we had not been properly introduced. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1181.8s)]
*  There is a protocol to meeting an elephant. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1185.8s)]
*  He will offer up his trunk and he expects you to blow in it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1188.8s)]
*  That way he will remember your scent forever. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1192.8s)]
*  You will never be strangers again. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1195.8s)]
*  The little baby's been captured. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1198.8s)]
*  The orphanage gets distress calls from all over Kenya, from all over East Africa, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1200.8s)]
*  that a baby elephant is on his own, often because his mother has been captured. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1205.8s)]
*  His mother has been killed by a poacher. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1209.8s)]
*  It is then a matter of great urgency. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1212.8s)]
*  An orphaned elephant can only survive a few days without his mother. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1214.8s)]
*  The baby elephant is loaded onto a plane and flown back to Daphne Sheldrick's orphanage outside Nairobi, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1219.8s)]
*  where he'll stay until he's strong enough to go back into the bush. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1225.8s)]
*  Dame Daphne has been running the orphanage for almost 30 years. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1232.8s)]
*  She was born and raised in Kenya and married David Sheldrick, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1236.8s)]
*  Africa's leading crusader against poaching. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1240.8s)]
*  When he died in 1977, she founded the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1243.8s)]
*  Daphne saw her mission as saving as many elephants as possible, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1249.8s)]
*  but she has never permitted herself too much hope. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1253.8s)]
*  That's because she loses half the elephants that arrive here, some from pneumonia, some from trauma. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1256.8s)]
*  This elephant probably witnessed its mother's death and remembers everything. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1262.8s)]
*  That's the double-edged sword of having the memory of an elephant they never forget. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1267.8s)]
*  You know, he's still grieving for his elephant family. He's in shock. He's distressed. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1273.8s)]
*  Do you believe a baby elephant can die of grief? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1278.8s)]
*  Oh yes, I know it can. They're terribly, terribly fragile. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1281.8s)]
*  You've got to try and turn the psyche around, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1285.8s)]
*  duplicating what that elephant would have had in an elephant family, touching them, talking to them gently. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1287.8s)]
*  In other words, love? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1293.8s)]
*  Tender loving care, TLC and a lot of it. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1295.8s)]
*  Daphne and the keepers may run this place officially, but it's the elephants who are really in charge. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1298.8s)]
*  For example, when a new keeper is hired, he's on probation for three months. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1304.8s)]
*  Then, if the elephants like him, he's got a job. If not, he's out. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1309.8s)]
*  What do you try to teach them? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1314.8s)]
*  Well, we have to teach them not to be naughty, not to push around with the others, to obey one another, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1316.8s)]
*  just like you have to do to your children, your own children, to respect the others. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1323.8s)]
*  And the keepers teach the elephants how to be elephants. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1328.8s)]
*  There are wild elephant things these kids don't know how to do. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1332.8s)]
*  Mother wasn't around to teach them. Things like covering themselves in dust to prevent sunburn. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1335.8s)]
*  The keepers do it with shovels until the elephants pick it up themselves. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1342.8s)]
*  The orphanage has an infirmary and the doctor has a call to make. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1347.8s)]
*  One of the elephants is not doing well at all. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1352.8s)]
*  He's been on antibiotics for two days now, but he can barely breathe. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1355.8s)]
*  All this froth that's coming out of his trunk has got to be pulmonary edema. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1359.8s)]
*  His room looks like an intensive care unit. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1364.8s)]
*  The doctor, Daphne, and the keepers don't leave him for a minute. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1367.8s)]
*  They do everything they can, but it's not enough. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1372.8s)]
*  By dawn, he is dead. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1377.8s)]
*  How do you manage going through this all the time? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1384.8s)]
*  Well, you don't have much option, do you? There's another one to look after, and then another one coming, and, you know, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1388.8s)]
*  you just have to turn the page. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1395.8s)]
*  And you get attached after one day. But I'm not very good at it. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1400.8s)]
*  And you're not going to get any better, are you? No. Not after 50 years. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1403.8s)]
*  But then you go and you hang out with the orphans who are doing so well, and it brings joy to your life. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1407.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1414.8s)]
*  It's actually a pretty lush life for these elephants here at the orphanage, but it's not the life of a wild elephant. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1416.8s)]
*  It's not their destiny. So like any good school, this place prepares its students to leave, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1422.8s)]
*  to get ready for life in the real world, to go back to the wild, from whence they came. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1427.8s)]
*  This young lady left Daphne's orphanage to go live in the wild. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1432.8s)]
*  Her name is Mpenzie, and a couple of years ago, she became pregnant and decided to go off on her own to give birth, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1437.8s)]
*  without the protection of her extended family. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1444.8s)]
*  That was a mistake. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1448.8s)]
*  Before the sun could set, Mpenzie and her baby were surrounded by a pride of 16 lions. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1450.8s)]
*  Keeper Joseph Sauny was called to the scene and captured the events on his still camera. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1457.8s)]
*  Some pens were standing there trying to scare off lions with their trunk. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1463.8s)]
*  But when they came, she tried to push them on this side, others come on the back. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1468.8s)]
*  Mpenzie didn't have a chance. How did you and the other keepers react? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1473.8s)]
*  It was so, so sad. In fact, everybody was crying. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1476.8s)]
*  And there was nothing they could do to save the baby. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1480.8s)]
*  It was a brutal lesson for Mpenzie. Nature has its own laws. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1483.8s)]
*  They're a long way from the sheltered world of the orphanage. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1488.8s)]
*  But this story has a happy ending. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1491.8s)]
*  Just days before we arrived, Mpenzie gave birth to another little girl. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1494.8s)]
*  The keepers have all come out to cheer her on. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1499.8s)]
*  They named her Asante, which in Swahili means thank you. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1503.8s)]
*  Mpenzie has learned her lesson. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1510.8s)]
*  This time she makes sure her bundle of joy is surrounded by other members of the family. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1513.8s)]
*  They help her up when she falls down and rescue her when she tumbles into a mud hole. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1519.8s)]
*  So for the moment, Asante will be safe, at least until she grows tusks. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1524.8s)]
*  If you could go just one place, anywhere on the planet, to see the most spectacular wildlife, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1534.8s)]
*  you'd want to head east to catch a site that comes around every year, but only for a short time. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1549.8s)]
*  It's called the Great Migration. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1555.8s)]
*  Millions of animals on an endless march of life and death and rebirth. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1557.8s)]
*  We'll save most of the superlatives for the pictures because you might agree, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1562.8s)]
*  this is one of the greatest shows on Earth. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1566.8s)]
*  We thought you should see it now, because there's no guarantee it'll be around forever. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1569.8s)]
*  There was a time when epic migrations were common. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1577.8s)]
*  Millions of buffalo in North America, for example. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1581.8s)]
*  But today, to see what that must have been like, you have to travel to East Africa. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1584.8s)]
*  Here in late summer, more than a million wildebeest cross the volcanic plain of the Maasai Mara in Kenya, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1592.8s)]
*  pushing through one of the most awe-inspiring wildlife habitats on Earth. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1600.8s)]
*  Nearly everything Africa has to offer, all in one place. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1607.8s)]
*  The dry season is moving the herds, concentrating them where there's still grass and water. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1626.8s)]
*  It's a march of 350 miles up from the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1632.8s)]
*  to the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya and back again. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1638.8s)]
*  Wildebeest calves, when they're born. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1643.8s)]
*  American scientist Robin Reed was hooked the very first time she saw it as a student. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1646.8s)]
*  She's on the faculty at Colorado State University and has spent decades studying the animals [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1651.8s)]
*  and the Maasai people who share the land with the Mara migration. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1657.8s)]
*  We don't have migrations anymore this large. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1661.8s)]
*  So this is the only one that stands by itself that is this large. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1663.8s)]
*  Now if you're talking about butterflies or you're talking about birds, you're talking about smaller animals, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1666.8s)]
*  absolutely you easily get up into these kinds of numbers. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1671.8s)]
*  But as far as big animals that are walking long distance, this is the one. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1674.8s)]
*  This is the last one on Earth. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1679.8s)]
*  Yes, the last one on Earth that is this large. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1681.8s)]
*  Wildebeest is Dutch for wild beast, which may refer more to its appearance than any ferocity. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1685.8s)]
*  It's a relative of the antelope, but it's unlike anything you've ever seen. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1692.8s)]
*  They call lions regal and elephants majestic. I wonder what you'd call a wildebeest. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1697.8s)]
*  I think they look insane. Their horns are kind of this way and that, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1702.8s)]
*  and then they have these big shoulders and why in the heck is that? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1706.8s)]
*  And they're a funny color, they're not pretty, and they've got a long tail. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1709.8s)]
*  They're put together in pieces. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1713.8s)]
*  Well, somebody once said it looks like an animal that's made out of spare parts. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1715.8s)]
*  And that's very apt. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1718.8s)]
*  Along with the wildebeest, there are hundreds of thousands of zebra, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1720.8s)]
*  nearly half a million gazelles, and all of them crossing the territory of predators, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1725.8s)]
*  including lion, hyena, this cheetah that we found with her three newborn cubs. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1731.8s)]
*  And the biggest predator of them all, crocodiles that patrol the Mara River, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1743.8s)]
*  which cuts right through the migration route. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1750.8s)]
*  This is easily the most dramatic point in the entire year-long migration. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1754.8s)]
*  There comes a time that the wildebeest and their calves have to cross the Mara River. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1761.8s)]
*  You can't believe how big these crocodiles are. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1766.8s)]
*  One of them is at least 15 feet long. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1769.8s)]
*  But the wildebeest have to come over in order to feed, and the crocodiles know that. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1772.8s)]
*  A wildebeest may go through 10 migrations in its lifetime, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1779.8s)]
*  and to see them hesitate at the bank, it's as though many of them knew what was coming. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1783.8s)]
*  First, the wildebeest is a very small creature. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1791.8s)]
*  First, two wildebeest scramble across. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1797.8s)]
*  The next group takes the plunge right into the waiting crocs. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1803.8s)]
*  The big croc strikes and has the wildebeest's horns between its jaws. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1810.8s)]
*  A second crocodile attacks. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1816.8s)]
*  Then a third, a fourth, and a fifth. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1821.8s)]
*  Now it's a struggle to find enough water to pull the wildebeest down to drown. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1834.8s)]
*  In the few days that it takes the herds to cross the river, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1842.8s)]
*  the crocs will bring down enough food to last for months. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1855.8s)]
*  Once the wildebeest see where the crocs are, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1861.8s)]
*  the herd runs upstream and surges across by the hundreds. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1866.8s)]
*  No one can say how long this migration has thrived, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1872.8s)]
*  but on the Mara River we began to see evidence that its future is not a sure thing. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1877.8s)]
*  Usually the wildebeest swim across, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1884.8s)]
*  but now the river is very low. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1887.8s)]
*  Could what has happened to other migrations in the world happen here? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1891.8s)]
*  Of course, absolutely. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1895.8s)]
*  The thing I'm most worried about for the future is the Mara River and the amount of water in it. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1897.8s)]
*  It's just the main artery of the ecosystem and it's very important. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1902.8s)]
*  This is that artery that Robin Reed is talking about, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1907.8s)]
*  and the best way to see it is from the air. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1911.8s)]
*  The Mara River rises in a place called the Mau Forest, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1914.8s)]
*  and it meanders about 250 miles or so down to Lake Victoria. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1917.8s)]
*  The Maasai tell us that there is less water in the river now than at any time they can remember. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1922.8s)]
*  If the Mara River went away, what impact would it have on all this? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1929.8s)]
*  We're not absolutely sure, but in the dry season it's the only thing that flows. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1932.8s)]
*  And so if that water went away, then the wildebeest population would collapse. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1936.8s)]
*  Collapse? What do you mean by collapse? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1940.8s)]
*  You know, I don't actually know if there would be very many left actually. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1943.8s)]
*  Not just the wildebeest, it would be many of the other species that require water. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1949.8s)]
*  You would lose hundreds of thousands of these animals? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1953.8s)]
*  Oh yes, absolutely. In fact, the estimates are, and this is a guess, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1955.8s)]
*  is that if the river were to dry up completely, in the very first week after it dried up, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1959.8s)]
*  we'd lose about 400,000 animals that would be left behind. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1965.8s)]
*  And that's a very big difference. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1969.8s)]
*  If the river were to dry up completely, in the very first week after it dried up, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1971.8s)]
*  we'd lose about 400,000 animals that would die. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1976.8s)]
*  In a week? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1980.8s)]
*  In a week, yes. And maybe that's an overestimate, but even if it's in a month, that's a lot. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1981.8s)]
*  We wanted to find out why the Mara River seems to be drying up, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1990.8s)]
*  so we headed north to its source, the Mau Forest. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1994.8s)]
*  The first thing you notice are wheat fields where the trees used to be, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=1997.8s)]
*  and beyond the expanding farms, we headed towards smoke on the horizon. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2001.8s)]
*  The trip brought us here. We're about five miles from the Mara River. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2007.8s)]
*  This isn't a wheat field yet, but it soon will be. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2011.8s)]
*  What happens before the forest becomes a wheat field is that [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2014.8s)]
*  charcoalers move through the area and cut down the trees [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2018.8s)]
*  to make one of the principal fuels for cooking. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2022.8s)]
*  The Mau Forest is falling to a growing population that's trying to make a living off the land. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2027.8s)]
*  For centuries, the Mau has been a sponge, holding and releasing waters into the river. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2032.8s)]
*  To scientists, the equation is simple. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2038.8s)]
*  If there's no Mau Forest, there's no Mara River. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2040.8s)]
*  And that means no migration. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2044.8s)]
*  Now, saving the Mau Forest has become a crisis in Kenya, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2048.8s)]
*  pitting the government against its own people. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2052.8s)]
*  The government has forcibly evicted as many as 50,000 settlers from the Mau. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2055.8s)]
*  We saw it in the village of Nkroni, which was settled in the forest more than 30 years ago. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2060.8s)]
*  The Kenyan government, back in the 1990s, even gave some of the villagers title to the land. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2066.8s)]
*  It says, nature of title, absolute. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2073.8s)]
*  You take it to mean absolute. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2079.8s)]
*  Well, not exactly. A new government has turned on them. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2081.8s)]
*  Now it says to save the forest, villages like this have to go. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2085.8s)]
*  In 2005, the government sent security forces to burn homes, schools and churches. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2090.8s)]
*  But still, the people refused to leave. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2098.8s)]
*  We will stay. We will not go anywhere. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2105.8s)]
*  If they want to kill us, they kill us. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2108.8s)]
*  You'd die right here. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2111.8s)]
*  The villagers in the forest don't see why their families should be uprooted for a wildlife refuge they've never seen. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2113.8s)]
*  But we found a different story downriver, in the Mara itself, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2121.8s)]
*  where the growing population of Maasai has been willing to compromise. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2126.8s)]
*  The population is a wild problem. It's growing and it's growing everywhere. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2131.8s)]
*  Dixon Kayelo works for a non-profit foundation that's paying the Maasai to turn over management of their land to a wildlife conservancy. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2137.8s)]
*  Many of the families before the conservancy started were very poor. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2146.8s)]
*  And quite a number of them are able now to survive and diversify away from just keeping cattle. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2151.8s)]
*  The Maasai have been expanding their farms and grazing cattle near the migration routes. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2158.8s)]
*  Now, the conservancy manages their land for wildlife. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2164.8s)]
*  Tourists pay to see the wildlife and the Maasai get a cut of the profits. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2168.8s)]
*  Families we talked to say they bring in an extra $200 a month, enough to send the kids to school. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2173.8s)]
*  So this is all part of the conservancy. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2179.8s)]
*  Kayelo has brought nearly 300 square miles under management, and that's growing. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2181.8s)]
*  I think the children and the children of our children would like to be able to experience the migration. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2188.8s)]
*  It doesn't matter whether they're living in China or in the Far East or in America. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2193.8s)]
*  They would like to know that the migration is still continuing. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2197.8s)]
*  As the wildebeest moved out of the Maasai Mara, we could see the beginnings of next year's spectacle. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2202.8s)]
*  The elephants were raising their calves. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2211.8s)]
*  And that cheetah was feeding her cubs on a waterbuck she'd killed. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2217.8s)]
*  Cheetah cubs chirp like birds. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2221.8s)]
*  And if they survive, they'll still be with their mother when the wildebeest come round again. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2225.8s)]
*  This perpetual cycle is still a robust force of nature. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2234.8s)]
*  But with the Mara River running low, and man crowding the route, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2239.8s)]
*  no one can be certain how many turns are left for this, the last spectacle of its kind. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2245.8s)]
*  More Americans go to zoos every year than to professional baseball, football, hockey, and basketball games combined. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2252.8s)]
*  We get to encounter the dangers of the wild from the safety of suburbia. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2260.8s)]
*  But increasingly, zoos see their mission as a way to protect themselves from the dangers of the wild. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2265.8s)]
*  And that's why they're called the wildebeest. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2272.8s)]
*  We get to encounter the dangers of the wild from the safety of suburbia. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2275.8s)]
*  But increasingly, zoos see their mission as not just displaying animals, but also saving endangered species. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2279.8s)]
*  And that raises an interesting question. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2287.8s)]
*  Can endangered animals born and bred in captivity be released into the wild? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2289.8s)]
*  A conservation group called the Aspenall Foundation is trying to find out. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2295.8s)]
*  It's run by Damien Aspenall, a multimillionaire who owns a chain of casinos in England. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2300.8s)]
*  But his biggest gamble involves his animals. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2307.8s)]
*  They say that the English can be eccentric, but Damien Aspenall takes the cake. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2311.8s)]
*  This 54-year-old likes to play tug of war with tigers and pet black rhinos. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2319.8s)]
*  But gorillas are his best buddies. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2327.8s)]
*  And wrestling with them is his favorite pastime. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2330.8s)]
*  They're part of my family and I'm part of their family. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2334.8s)]
*  They see me as an intricate part of their lives. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2337.8s)]
*  And when I look after these animals, they're my equal. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2340.8s)]
*  Now the tricky thing is getting out. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2342.8s)]
*  I'm not allowed to leave. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2349.8s)]
*  Damien gets to do this because he oversees this 500-acre wildlife park that looks like the Serengeti, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2351.8s)]
*  but is in Kent, England, surrounding Damien's country estates. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2359.8s)]
*  The zoo was started by his wealthy and no less eccentric father, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2364.8s)]
*  who liked to take a dip in the pool with the tigers and let the gorillas roam about the grounds. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2368.8s)]
*  When you were a little boy, were the gorillas your playmates? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2374.8s)]
*  Yeah, without question. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2378.8s)]
*  The problem being, of course, you never had any human friends because no parents would ever let you have a play date. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2379.8s)]
*  When Damien took over the zoo, he set out to save the species. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2384.8s)]
*  Over 130 critically endangered Western lowland gorillas have been bred here more than at any other zoo on Earth. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2388.8s)]
*  Also, 30 near-extinct black rhinos, 180 tigers, and 140 rare clouded leopards. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2396.8s)]
*  But not to keep them. It wasn't long before Damien decided that zoos are immoral. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2405.8s)]
*  They're jails that lock up the innocent for life. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2411.8s)]
*  So his goal now is to set all the animals that were born here free. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2415.8s)]
*  If I could extinguish all zoos over the next 30 years, including my own, I would. I wouldn't hesitate. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2420.8s)]
*  And you don't think, as many do, that the zoo animal is an ambassador [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2426.8s)]
*  and that they educate the public, who then in turn becomes more interested in conservation? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2432.8s)]
*  Please show me the statistical evidence that zoos educate and that education that they claim they're doing has helped animals in the wild. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2438.8s)]
*  There is no evidence because it's a lie. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2446.8s)]
*  But if you go to a zoo, you should see the faces of children when they actually see an animal. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2449.8s)]
*  But that's so wrong. The face should be one of disgust. That's what's so wrong. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2455.8s)]
*  We've cultured them. Oh, those animals are here for our pleasure. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2461.8s)]
*  We don't have the right as a species to take animals to pleasure our children. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2465.8s)]
*  That disgusts me. These poor animals. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2470.8s)]
*  So this zookeeper, who hates zoos, announced that he was going to send an entire family of zoo gorillas to Africa. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2473.8s)]
*  A silverback named Jala, his five wives, and four infants. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2481.8s)]
*  A project no other zoo would even consider. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2486.8s)]
*  Why isn't anybody else doing it? Because they don't believe in it. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2490.8s)]
*  You've got to understand, we're considered mavericks. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2493.8s)]
*  You know, we're dea- They're actually considered a little nutty. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2496.8s)]
*  Yeah, but that's such a good thing. It's only the nutty people who ever get anything done in this world. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2499.8s)]
*  But these giants are actually very fragile. They get stressed and even depressed by change, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2504.8s)]
*  finding it hard to adapt to new environments, especially the adults. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2510.8s)]
*  You know, people think, well, we're going to send them home to Africa. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2515.8s)]
*  This is home. They were born here. Why would they want to go back if they're living a cushy- [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2518.8s)]
*  Why would they want to go back? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2522.8s)]
*  Well, because it's cushy here. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2523.8s)]
*  But, so you decide that? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2524.8s)]
*  But you're deciding to send them back. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2526.8s)]
*  Because this is where they belong. I'm not really deciding anything. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2528.8s)]
*  They've, for 50,000 years, have evolved in this forest. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2530.8s)]
*  That's surely where they belong, not after 12 years living in a zoo. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2533.8s)]
*  But isn't it dangerous for the animals to release them into the wild if they've been raised in a place like this, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2537.8s)]
*  where they're pampered and they're fed? How can they survive in the wild? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2546.8s)]
*  Man always underestimates the intelligence of wild animals. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2551.8s)]
*  You have to help them on their way, but if you leave them be, they'll pick it up immediately. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2555.8s)]
*  To help them on their way, Damien created Gorilla School in his mansion's backyard, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2559.8s)]
*  where he himself taught these English-born infants survival basics, like how to climb a tree and avoid poisoned berries. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2566.8s)]
*  Still, sending a family of 10 gorillas to Africa was a massive undertaking. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2575.8s)]
*  They had to be sedated and couriered. You couldn't make this up, by DHL. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2582.8s)]
*  Was that hard for you? You're basically sending your family away. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2589.8s)]
*  Honestly, no. I'm so proud that they're going where they belong. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2593.8s)]
*  If I didn't do it, I would not live easy within myself. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2597.8s)]
*  The gorillas were flown to Gabon and taken by raft to this dense forest, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2601.8s)]
*  about a million acres that he bought and turned into a national park to protect animals like the Western lowland gorillas, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2607.8s)]
*  whose numbers keep dwindling due to habitat destruction and poaching. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2614.8s)]
*  I'm wondering why the poachers even want gorillas. They don't have horns, they don't have ivory. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2619.8s)]
*  They eat bush meat, they'll eat the gorillas, they'll cut their hands off and sell them as ashtrays. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2625.8s)]
*  The babies are taken for pet trade. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2631.8s)]
*  To keep them safe, the gorillas were taken at first to an island to acclimate. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2634.8s)]
*  Damien's staff continued to feed them and give them medicines, like malaria pills. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2639.8s)]
*  This wasn't his first time sending gorillas here. He had already sent 12 from his zoo. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2645.8s)]
*  But they were all babies who hadn't adapted yet to the zoo. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2651.8s)]
*  He's taken many trips to see how they're doing. He says most of them have survived and multiplied. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2655.8s)]
*  But on one visit that he videotaped, he was concerned about one of them, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2662.8s)]
*  Kweeby, who hadn't been seen in a long time. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2667.8s)]
*  And I went up the river and called for him. He obviously heard my call. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2671.8s)]
*  And he came down to the edge of the river. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2675.8s)]
*  And I jumped out of the boat and I went to see him and he greeted me with a fantastic gurgle, love gurgle. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2677.8s)]
*  We sat there together and he was so sweet and introduced me to all his wives. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2689.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2694.8s)]
*  Then when I wanted to leave, he wouldn't let me leave. He clung on to me very tightly. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2698.8s)]
*  He wanted me to stay, but I know the best thing for him was for me not to stay. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2703.8s)]
*  And he's wild and let him be wild. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2709.8s)]
*  Come and see you tomorrow, okay? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2712.8s)]
*  All right, come and see you tomorrow. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2715.8s)]
*  Looks idyllic, but conservationists we spoke to were critical of Damien, some calling his work a vanity project. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2717.8s)]
*  Maybe it makes him feel good. He has a relationship with these animals and he wants to do well for them. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2724.8s)]
*  And he thinks that taking them back to Africa will be doing that. But it's not conservation. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2730.8s)]
*  Tara Stoinski is president of the Diane Fossey Gorilla Fund, run out of Zoo Atlanta, home to the largest collection of gorillas in North America. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2735.8s)]
*  She says returning a handful of zoo animals can't begin to counter the vast numbers that are lost every year. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2744.8s)]
*  So Damien's money would be better spent saving gorillas already in the wild. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2751.8s)]
*  We need all hands on deck right now to be conserving wild populations. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2756.8s)]
*  We need funds to be going into saving these wild places so that the animals that are living there currently can continue to survive. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2761.8s)]
*  You know, there's just something kind of, I think, in us, intuitively in us, that we want to see these animals roaming free. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2768.8s)]
*  I think that humans have a very romantic notion of what the wild is like. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2779.8s)]
*  And the wild is not a place where it is safe and animals get to roam free and make choices. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2783.8s)]
*  They have to find food, they have to avoid predators, they have to find mates. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2789.8s)]
*  And then you add on top of that all of the challenges that our humans are imposing, whether it be hunting, habitat loss, disease. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2793.8s)]
*  I think the challenges that these wild populations face are huge. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2800.8s)]
*  One year after the silverback from Kent, Jala, and his family were sent to Gabon, we went with Damien to see how they were coping. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2805.8s)]
*  Here we are. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2814.8s)]
*  We snaked down the Impasa River, but there was no sign of Jala through the dense vegetation. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2815.8s)]
*  Then a glimpse of eyes and limbs through the trees. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2822.8s)]
*  As our boat approached, the females and infants came slowly into the clearing. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2826.8s)]
*  They're so calm. It's such a beautiful thing to see. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2832.8s)]
*  I mean, how happy do they look? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2836.8s)]
*  But when Jala came forward, he didn't look all that happy. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2838.8s)]
*  He knows I'm here now. He's protecting his females. He's just looking at me. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2842.8s)]
*  But Damien was ecstatic as they settled on the grass in front of us. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2847.8s)]
*  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2852.8s)]
*  A full house. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2856.8s)]
*  Did you give the baby a name? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2858.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's Aku. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2859.8s)]
*  Damien began tossing them coconuts, sugar cane, and bananas. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2861.8s)]
*  That's Tamki. She's calling for some. Hey. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2866.8s)]
*  She keeps wanting more. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2870.8s)]
*  Yes, I said it. She's smart though because she gets more than anyone else. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2871.8s)]
*  Do you think that you have brought them home? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2875.8s)]
*  Without any question, yeah. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2877.8s)]
*  But they weren't totally free yet. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2879.8s)]
*  Damien's idea was to complete this bridge only when he felt they could fend for themselves. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2882.8s)]
*  And just over the other side of that bridge is the true wilderness. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2888.8s)]
*  They don't swim? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2892.8s)]
*  No. So here they're protected because they're on an island, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2893.8s)]
*  but once they cross the bridge they'll come across elephants and leopards and other gorillas. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2896.8s)]
*  Jala's going to be defending his females. He might lose some of his females. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2901.8s)]
*  It could become very stressful. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2905.8s)]
*  You mean other males who are there wild. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2906.8s)]
*  Yes, wild. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2909.8s)]
*  Will challenge him for his females. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2910.8s)]
*  But Damien thinks this family is ready, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2911.8s)]
*  and so he and his crew put the final planks on the bridge. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2914.8s)]
*  Then he tries to lure the gorillas over with, but of course, food. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2918.8s)]
*  Come on. Come on. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2924.8s)]
*  Wouldn't you know it? The females venture out first, and once again Jala follows their lead. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2930.8s)]
*  Jala's going in. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2936.8s)]
*  Brilliant. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2937.8s)]
*  Oh my goodness. And look at the babies, the second one. Oh my gosh. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2938.8s)]
*  That's wonderful, isn't it? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2942.8s)]
*  That's one-year-old Akku. Within an hour, all ten had crossed over. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2943.8s)]
*  This is the ultimate goal. This is the holy grail. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2949.8s)]
*  Although they will get over on this side and inevitably face dangers that they're not really prepared for. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2952.8s)]
*  The problem will be when the other males turn up here. They have been quite near in the last few days. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2960.8s)]
*  So I suspect they are quite near, and I suspect within a few hours they'll be coming to investigate. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2966.8s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2971.8s)]
*  Oh boy. Yeah. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2972.8s)]
*  If only we could end on an optimistic note, but we can't. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2976.8s)]
*  A month after the gorillas crossed the bridge, Damien's team found all five adult females dead, including Tampke, as well as baby Akku. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2981.8s)]
*  An outcome so many of Damien's critics predicted. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2992.8s)]
*  So what does this mean for his experiment? We remembered what he said back in Kent. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=2995.8s)]
*  It may be a disaster, and if it's a disaster and they all die, all those people will jump up and down and say he was an idiot. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=3001.8s)]
*  Fine, I'm willing to take that. I don't care. I don't seek popularity. I'm the ambassador for these animals. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=3008.8s)]
*  I'm here to protect those animals and give them their chance to go back into the wild, because what I don't believe in is they should spend the rest of their lives in captivity. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=3014.8s)]
*  Damien's best guess is that a wild male silverback attacked the family, killing some on the spot, others dying from injury infections or stress. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=3020.8s)]
*  He called it a hell of a setback, but is determined to send more gorillas into the wild. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=3031.8s)]
*  Thank you for watching! [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEOzE-varA&t=3050.8s)]
