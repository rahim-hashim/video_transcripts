# Elephants | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0)
*  The Elephant [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=0.0s)]
*  If you ever get an opportunity to go to Thailand, chances are you'll come home with a souvenir [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=13.0s)]
*  with the country's national animal on it, the Asian elephant. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=18.14s)]
*  Elephants are more than a point of pride in Thailand. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=22.54s)]
*  They're part of the country's identity. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=25.18s)]
*  A century ago, 90% of Thailand was covered in lush forests where over 100,000 wild elephants roamed. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=27.56s)]
*  Today, that natural habitat has been reduced by more than half, with only an estimated [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=35.0s)]
*  4,400 wild elephants remaining. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=40.1s)]
*  That dwindling landscape has created a growing conflict between humans and elephants. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=43.3s)]
*  To understand it, we traveled to western Thailand to talk to villagers who are dealing with [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  weekly elephant invasions and meet with scientists who believe they've come up with novel solutions [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=54.72s)]
*  to combat the problem. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=61.1s)]
*  Deep inside Thailand's mountainous western forest complex 100 miles northwest of Bangkok, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=65.58s)]
*  we made the bumpy trip into one of the country's best-kept secrets. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=72.48s)]
*  The Sulawak Pro Wildlife Sanctuary, an unconfined, lush green haven that allows 300 wild Asian [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=77.2s)]
*  elephants free-range. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=84.88s)]
*  Our guide was wildlife ranger Suthichai. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  How long have you been doing this work? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=91.92s)]
*  He told us he's been a ranger for nine years and has noticed an increase in the number [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=95.32s)]
*  of elephants in the sanctuary. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=99.86s)]
*  Eager to see one up close, we stopped where a herd had just come through and hiked through [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=103.32s)]
*  the thick humidity deeper into the sanctuary and saw this handsome fella. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  About nine feet tall and four tons, he was enjoying his daily dust bath. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  Greeted 60 years ago as Thailand's first wildlife sanctuary, Sulawak Pro is an elephant's paradise. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=123.96s)]
*  Containing more than 300 square miles of dense bamboo forests, streams and watering [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=131.92s)]
*  holes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=137.48s)]
*  A conservation area set up by the government to give wild elephants a protected home. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=138.48s)]
*  Elephants have always held a special place in Thailand's rich history. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  In Buddhism, they're considered sacred, once a symbol of power for Thai royalty and a weapon [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=151.48s)]
*  of war. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=157.56s)]
*  Their size and might made them ideal for Thailand's lucrative logging industry, which ended up [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=159.42s)]
*  destroying more than half their natural habitat. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=164.54s)]
*  In 1989, logging was banned in Thailand after devastating floods, putting thousands of elephants [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=168.27999999999997s)]
*  out of work. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=174.94s)]
*  The government moved quickly to find those elephants' new homes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=177.61999999999998s)]
*  One of them is this National Conservation Center in northern Thailand, where mahouts [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=181.66s)]
*  or elephant handlers tend to all the elephants. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=188.38s)]
*  And vets see to their medical needs. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=194.76s)]
*  Many were brought into tourism, an industry that brings millions into the Thai economy [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=197.94s)]
*  and leaves lucky visitors like me with a little elephant snot and a big smile. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=203.94s)]
*  But the country's remaining 4,000 wild elephants faced a different future. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=213.24s)]
*  Their population is growing, about 8 percent a year, forcing some of them into communities [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=218.9s)]
*  to look for food. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=224.82000000000002s)]
*  That doesn't always end well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=226.58s)]
*  Over the last six years, at least 135 people have been killed by elephants in Thailand. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=229.24s)]
*  The problem isn't unlike human wildlife encounters in the United States. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=235.8s)]
*  Coyotes in cities or bears rummaging through town trash or raiding homes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=241.48s)]
*  But stopping one of these massive beasts isn't so easy. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=247.6s)]
*  It's illegal to shoot even a charging elephant in Thailand. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=253.32s)]
*  American researcher Dr. Josh Plotnick and his team are trying to find a way for people [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  and elephants to live here peacefully. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=263.26s)]
*  We met Plotnick at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in northern Thailand. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=266.36s)]
*  There's always been elephants here, there's always been farms. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=271.82s)]
*  Why the problem now? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=274.56s)]
*  Yeah, but there haven't always been as many farmers, as many people, as much technology, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=276.16s)]
*  as much infrastructure. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=280.74s)]
*  And so inevitably when you reduce the space that wildlife has, they need to figure out [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  how to find the resources that they need. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  And sometimes those resources are in crop fields and people can react very negatively [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=289.72s)]
*  to that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  Is there a breaking point? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=294.78000000000003s)]
*  There definitely is, and I think we're getting close to it simply because we don't have [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=296.24s)]
*  solutions to these problems. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=301.72s)]
*  And all we can do as scientists, conservationists, is to try to find ways to ensure that elephants [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=303.36s)]
*  have what they need, while at the same time humans have what they need. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=308.56s)]
*  Nice office. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=312.12s)]
*  Yeah, this is our favorite office. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=313.12s)]
*  Josh Plotnick spends summers studying elephants inside Salok Pro Sanctuary and is a professor [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=314.92s)]
*  of animal behavior and cognition at Hunter College in New York. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  For the past 13 years, he's led the only research team inside Thailand dedicated to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=325.16s)]
*  understanding elephant psychology, or why elephants do the things they do. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  And it turns out, like New Yorkers, Asian elephants are a unique breed. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  Smaller than their African cousins, when Asian elephants age, they lose pigment, creating [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=342.76000000000005s)]
*  that pinkish glow. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=348.12s)]
*  They also have a divot on their head, creating two distinct domes. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=350.36s)]
*  But it's what's inside their massive head that fascinates researcher Josh Plotnick. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=355.92s)]
*  Are all elephants alike? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=362.04s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=363.92s)]
*  I mean, we see innovation and problem-solving, how they react to novel objects, how well [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=364.92s)]
*  they cooperate with each other. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=370.56s)]
*  Some are more afraid of things they've never seen before. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=372.36s)]
*  Some are less afraid. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=375.14s)]
*  Some are brave when it comes to interacting with predators or humans. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=376.14s)]
*  Asian elephants' brains are four times larger than humans. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=380.2s)]
*  They're one of the most intelligent animals in the world, which means much of their behavior [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=384.03999999999996s)]
*  is learned rather than instinctive. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=388.96s)]
*  Those unique experiences create unique personalities. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=393.2s)]
*  And so that variation, which not only tells us something about personality in elephants, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=397.68s)]
*  it also helps us understand why human-elephant conflict is happening and why not every elephant [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=402.68s)]
*  in the wild is interacting with people in such a way that results in these negative [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=409.64s)]
*  interactions. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's the key of all this, right? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  We think so. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=416.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=417.44s)]
*  What most people don't understand is that now it's not me looking across a field and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=418.44s)]
*  seeing an elephant and being able to peacefully observe them. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=423.88s)]
*  Now for villagers in some of the provinces in Thailand, every night they're worried not [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=427.12s)]
*  about this beautiful, majestic animal being on the periphery of their crop field, but [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=432.56s)]
*  this bulldozer coming in and eating their entire crop field. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=436.64s)]
*  Stealthy bulldozers quietly rolling towards sweet high octane crops like cassava and sugarcane, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  sometimes wiping out fields and a farm's monthly income in one night. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=448.56s)]
*  We're the elephant. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=453.76s)]
*  We're walking from a safe place, the protected sanctuary, into a crop field, and they do [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=454.76s)]
*  this on an almost nightly basis. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=458.8s)]
*  They'll come out of the sanctuary, they come up to this electric fence area that's protecting [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=460.28s)]
*  this cassava field, and they make a decision. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=463.96s)]
*  Do I go in and munch on the cassava or do I go back into the protected area? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=465.76s)]
*  Surveillance cameras captured these elephants making that same journey from the sanctuary [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=470.96s)]
*  to those tasty cassava fields, carefully navigating the electric fence and raiding farmer Weera [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=475.68s)]
*  Maniwong's crops. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=483.32s)]
*  Weera has been farming for 20 years. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=485.56s)]
*  He told us his income has been cut by nearly a quarter due to weekly elephant incursions, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=489.08s)]
*  something he's desperate to stop. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=495.28s)]
*  Every night, he climbs a watchtower to look over his crops and patrols the edge of his [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=497.88s)]
*  fields for elephants, flashing a light from his truck or throwing firecrackers to try [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=503.7s)]
*  and scare them away. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  That seems like it could be dangerous chasing an elephant. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=511.15999999999997s)]
*  It's very dangerous, but I have to do it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=515.6s)]
*  Otherwise, they will damage all my crops. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=518.1999999999999s)]
*  What other kind of damage have you seen the elephants do in the village? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=520.56s)]
*  They damage homes and cars. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  Three people have been killed recently by elephants in my village, including my uncle. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=531.52s)]
*  Pawina Echachan is from another village 50 miles away. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=538.76s)]
*  Her 54-year-old husband was killed trying to protect their crops. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=543.0s)]
*  An alarm he had set up near the crops had gone off, but that night the elephant didn't [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=548.8s)]
*  go away. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=552.96s)]
*  My husband ran out to try and scare him, and he tripped in the field, and that's when the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=554.12s)]
*  elephant trampled him. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=558.68s)]
*  And it's not just on farms. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=562.32s)]
*  People in villages have been trampled as the elephants occasionally invade homes at night [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=565.44s)]
*  and run along roads, sometimes raiding sugarcane trucks along the way. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=572.44s)]
*  So what do you do? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=580.2800000000001s)]
*  I wish we had a simple answer to that question. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=582.0s)]
*  There are a lot of different ways to do this. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=584.96s)]
*  One is to focus on the people. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=586.5200000000001s)]
*  Can we find different crops for them to plant that maybe the elephants aren't attracted [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=588.08s)]
*  to? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=591.72s)]
*  Can we find ways to set up more permanent barriers? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=592.8800000000001s)]
*  But what we're trying to do that I think is unique is focusing on the elephant, right? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=596.1600000000001s)]
*  If elephant behavior varies from one elephant to the next, is that something that might [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=601.28s)]
*  inform the development of new strategies that are targeted at specific personality traits, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=605.84s)]
*  certain behavioral traits that these elephants are exhibiting that might be better or stronger [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=611.84s)]
*  long-term solutions that would prevent elephants from coming into crop fields? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=617.12s)]
*  When we come back, we'll learn how Josh Plotnick and his research team are hoping something [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=621.96s)]
*  called a targeted personality device will stop human-elephant conflict in Thailand. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=626.84s)]
*  When people and wildlife meet unexpectedly, the result isn't always good. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=641.08s)]
*  Decades of deforestation and overdevelopment of natural habitat have left wild animals [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=646.24s)]
*  in search of new sources for food. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=651.76s)]
*  In the United States, that might look like a bear busting into a home looking for lunch. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=654.28s)]
*  But in Thailand, it's an even bigger problem, thousands of pounds bigger. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=659.04s)]
*  Increasingly, wild Asian elephants have wandered into towns and villages looking for food, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=663.88s)]
*  sometimes with deadly consequences. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=669.76s)]
*  Now, American researcher and elephant behavior specialist Dr. Josh Plotnick hopes he may [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=672.1999999999999s)]
*  have found a solution to this growing problem. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=678.64s)]
*  Josh Plotnick's big aha moment on how complex Asian elephant behavior can be came 13 years [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=682.88s)]
*  ago in northern Thailand. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=691.48s)]
*  He placed a mirror in the middle of a field and watched to see what five-year-old two-ton [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=694.16s)]
*  Lin Chi would do. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=699.64s)]
*  Instead of seeing herself as another threatening animal and attacking the mirror, Lin Chi, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=702.4399999999999s)]
*  the Guiney self-respecting girl, began checking herself out, inspecting her face and mouth, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=708.04s)]
*  showing a higher level of intelligence and self-directed behavior, launching Josh Plotnick [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=714.24s)]
*  into a new realm of study. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=720.4399999999999s)]
*  How much have they been studying the elephant's brain? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=722.7199999999999s)]
*  Not much at all. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=725.4399999999999s)]
*  Most of what we know about elephant behavior comes from these long-term field sites in [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=726.52s)]
*  Africa and a few long-term field sites in Asia that are mainly focused on understanding [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=730.1999999999999s)]
*  population dynamics, but actually studying what's going on inside an elephant's mind [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=735.38s)]
*  requires you to do controlled experiments where you actually are interacting with the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=740.5s)]
*  elephants up close. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=744.5s)]
*  That's really difficult to do in the wild, but we're learning. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=745.58s)]
*  Josh Plotnick has spent the last five years leading a team of American anti-researchers [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=749.22s)]
*  in long-term studies of wild Asian elephant behavior in Thailand's Salokprasanctuary. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=755.14s)]
*  Their tests have evolved from elephants reacting to novel objects like brushes and fire hoses [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=763.54s)]
*  in trees to one of the team's most groundbreaking behavioral experiments to date, the puzzle box. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=770.66s)]
*  The test is made up of three metal boxes, three doors and a sweet reward inside. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=780.38s)]
*  You've got the answers. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=786.86s)]
*  How does this work? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=787.86s)]
*  Sarah Jacobson, a postdoctoral researcher at Hunter College in New York, designed the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=788.86s)]
*  box and is part of Plotnick's research team. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=794.22s)]
*  This top one is a slide door. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=797.46s)]
*  You just have to slide to the right and then reach in and grab the bananas from in there. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=799.22s)]
*  And then we have a push door, which is just held by a magnet right there. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=804.34s)]
*  So you push open and reach in. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=808.26s)]
*  And then this pull door where they have to wrap their trunk around and pull down. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=811.38s)]
*  Jacobson says in the wild, some elephants are amazing problem solvers, particularly [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=817.18s)]
*  when they're hungry. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=824.3s)]
*  Those trunks can smell water and food as far as 12 miles away. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=826.1s)]
*  So how innovative would these elephants be with the puzzle boxes? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=831.34s)]
*  We sat back and watched. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=835.58s)]
*  Sniffing the banana inside, 17-year-old Nam May starts knocking repeatedly on the boxes, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=838.3s)]
*  probing each door. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=845.54s)]
*  There you go. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=847.14s)]
*  Good girl. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=848.8199999999999s)]
*  Until she finds success by pushing in door number two, grabbing that reward inside. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=850.14s)]
*  She innovated to open the first door. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=859.54s)]
*  That was something she'd never seen before. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=861.9s)]
*  But now we want her to use a different technique and try to open a different door. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=864.06s)]
*  She has to change her behavior to do something different to try to open it. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=868.42s)]
*  Oh gosh. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=872.9s)]
*  Oh, she's thinking. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=874.6999999999999s)]
*  She's got to pull that chain. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=876.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=877.5s)]
*  She did it. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=879.5s)]
*  That was impressive. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=880.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, there you go. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=888.5s)]
*  Well done. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=890.5s)]
*  When Jacobson put the test up in the wild, some elephants seemed to be afraid and ran [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=893.5s)]
*  away from the puzzle boxes. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=898.8199999999999s)]
*  Some tried using brute force. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=902.3s)]
*  Others were fascinated but left, well, puzzled. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=905.6999999999999s)]
*  Over two years, 176 elephants approached the puzzle box and 58 of them solved at least [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=910.3s)]
*  one door. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=917.9s)]
*  But this one, a five-ton adult male, put them all to shame, figuring out all three doors [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=921.9s)]
*  in less than two minutes. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=929.98s)]
*  So what has all this puzzle-solving shown? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=934.98s)]
*  Smart girl. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=938.58s)]
*  Plotnik believes, like people, elephants show a huge range of innovation and persistence, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=939.98s)]
*  a factor he thinks could be key in deterring the more tenacious elephants from raiding [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=945.98s)]
*  farms and villages. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=951.98s)]
*  So you're looking for the troublemaker elephants? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=953.98s)]
*  Correct. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=956.98s)]
*  Elephants evolve this capacity for hearing really well and smelling really well and using [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=957.98s)]
*  their trunk to manipulate aspects of their environment. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=962.98s)]
*  So when they come into contact with something new or novel, but they know that there's something [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=965.98s)]
*  they really want on the other side of that novel thing, elephants with certain personality [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=969.98s)]
*  traits find ways around those deterrents. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=974.98s)]
*  So if they're cognitively flexible, we need to take a more flexible approach to keeping [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=978.98s)]
*  them away from humans. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=983.98s)]
*  I think that's exactly what we need to be doing and how we need to think about it. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=984.98s)]
*  Who is this? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=987.98s)]
*  Something veterinarian and leading Thai wildlife researcher Bori Pat Sirisirunrat spends a [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=988.98s)]
*  lot of time thinking about. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=995.98s)]
*  We met up with Bori Pat working with a local patrol to track down a wild elephant named [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=997.98s)]
*  Mango. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1003.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1004.98s)]
*  Clap your ears and tell. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1005.98s)]
*  20 years old and weighing in at a hefty 10,000 pounds, Mango had made his way down from the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1007.98s)]
*  mountains and into this rural village in eastern Thailand. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1014.98s)]
*  It's about 5, 15 p.m. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1018.98s)]
*  So it started to become active and start to go out looking for food. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1021.98s)]
*  We spent the next two hours following a feasting Mango from this back garden, down the main [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1026.98s)]
*  road and straight into and through the village's central square. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1033.98s)]
*  Strolling past the local restaurant and on to his next meal as locals stood back in amazement [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1039.98s)]
*  and took photos. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1047.98s)]
*  We knew Mango would be here because six months ago Bori Pat, along with a team of rangers [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1049.98s)]
*  and vets, went deep into the forest and put a massive tracking collar like this around [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1057.98s)]
*  Mango's neck while he was sedated. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1064.98s)]
*  Every day we get coordinates or their whereabouts sending to my mailbox and then we can actually [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1067.98s)]
*  log in on a website to see exactly where the elephants are. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1073.98s)]
*  And then what do you do with that information? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1077.98s)]
*  We can warn the people, you know, how far is this group of five elephants from their [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1079.98s)]
*  household so they can be mentally, physically prepared to deal with their daily routines. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1083.98s)]
*  Elephants are tracked at this command center where a team monitors five that have been [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1090.98s)]
*  tagged so far. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1095.98s)]
*  Here you can see a map of the village where we met Mango. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1097.98s)]
*  The red dot and line show where he's headed and where he's been over the last 24 hours. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1101.98s)]
*  Warnings are sent back from the command center to the phones of the village patrol. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1108.98s)]
*  There's photos of the elephant that is spotted at night in which property and which owner [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1113.98s)]
*  so they warn each family to look out for the elephants and the danger that might come with [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1119.98s)]
*  the elephants. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1124.98s)]
*  Josh Plotnick is now working with Bori Pat to enhance his own theories on behavior to [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1126.98s)]
*  stop elephants like Mango from wandering into farms and villages. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1131.98s)]
*  Short of putting a growling predator in its path, it's hard to get an elephant to retreat [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1136.98s)]
*  when it's looking for food. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1141.98s)]
*  So Plotnick's team has created a more manageable deterrent. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1143.98s)]
*  It's called the targeted personality device. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1147.98s)]
*  What's a targeted personality device? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1151.98s)]
*  The idea is that you're basically targeting mitigation for human-elephant conflict at a [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1154.98s)]
*  particular individual based on their personality. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1159.98s)]
*  It has three programmable components. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1162.98s)]
*  So if an elephant is coming into a crop field regularly and the farmer and we as researchers [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1165.98s)]
*  can identify that elephant, we can say, okay, that elephant has these particular personality [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1170.98s)]
*  traits, let's program this targeted personality device based on those traits and hope that [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1174.98s)]
*  that creates a situation where the elephant doesn't want to go into the crop field any longer. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1179.98s)]
*  In other words, by knowing what kind of elephant they're dealing with, scientists can find the [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1184.98s)]
*  right thing to warn them away. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1189.98s)]
*  We went with Josh Plotnick and researcher Matthew Rudolph to a farmer's crop field to see the [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1193.98s)]
*  targeted personality device in action. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1199.98s)]
*  So this computer system allows us to play back multimodal sensory information for the [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1202.98s)]
*  elephant. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1207.98s)]
*  In other words, we can display lights that strobe or have different colors. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1208.98s)]
*  We can play back acoustic information that's programmed for a potential predator and then [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1211.98s)]
*  we can spray olfactory information that sends a signal to the elephant that there might be [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1215.98s)]
*  the smell of a tiger or the smell of a human close by. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1219.98s)]
*  So for instance, if Matthew were to press number two, which would indicate an elephant [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1222.98s)]
*  that might be afraid of potential predators, it would play back the sound of a predator. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1227.98s)]
*  So you're throwing everything at them. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1238.98s)]
*  Yeah, the whole idea here is to create a sensory world for the elephant. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1241.98s)]
*  They're going to be able to see, hear and smell a potential predator enough to say, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1245.98s)]
*  this is not a good place for me to be. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1250.98s)]
*  Here you can see when an elephant approaches, flashing lights, spraying odor, and the sound [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1252.98s)]
*  of a yelling woman send the elephant running away and back into the jungle. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1260.98s)]
*  The trick for scientists is knowing how each elephant will respond. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1265.98s)]
*  Plotnik hopes that by understanding each elephant's unique personality traits, scientists can [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1271.98s)]
*  help create harmony between the most sacred animal in Thailand and its people. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1277.98s)]
*  What is it that conservationists and scientists and government officials have gotten wrong [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1283.98s)]
*  about trying to stop this human-elephant conflict up till now? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1287.98s)]
*  I think people really need to understand how serious this problem could grow simply because [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1292.98s)]
*  you have an intelligent animal on both sides. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1297.98s)]
*  If you have an intelligent elephant and an intelligent human trying to share limited resources, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1300.98s)]
*  conflict is inevitable until we come up with better solutions to promote coexistence. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1305.98s)]
*  You kind of need to know the bird. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1311.98s)]
*  Alright. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1315.98s)]
*  He wants us to be done. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1317.98s)]
*  That's a wrap. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1318.98s)]
*  For two decades, a group of wild African elephants has been watched over, studied, and protected [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1328.98s)]
*  by their own guardian angel, an extraordinary American scientist named Andrea Tercalo. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1335.98s)]
*  As you're about to see, Andrea's own story is pretty amazing, but not nearly as compelling [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1341.98s)]
*  as the insights into elephant behavior her research has revealed, especially when it [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1346.98s)]
*  comes to the secret language of elephants. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1351.98s)]
*  Elephants communicate in a complicated, sophisticated language that scientists are trying to decipher [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1353.98s)]
*  and compile into the world's first elephant dictionary. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1358.98s)]
*  When we heard that this is all happening in one of the most magical places on earth, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1362.98s)]
*  a remote clearing in central Africa, where forest elephants, the rarest, most mysterious, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1366.98s)]
*  and most threatened member of the species congregate, well, we simply had to go. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1372.98s)]
*  The Sanga River flows through the Congo Basin along the border between Cameroon and the [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1377.98s)]
*  Central African Republic, in the second largest rainforest on earth. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1382.98s)]
*  This remote corner of the world is the place Andrea Tercalo, a field biologist from Taunton, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1386.98s)]
*  Massachusetts, has called home for nearly two decades. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1392.98s)]
*  Andrea lives in a compound that she and a group of pygmies built from scratch. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1396.98s)]
*  The pygmies have been living in the area for over a century. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1401.98s)]
*  Andrea has been a group of pygmies built from scratch. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1404.98s)]
*  The pygmies help her run the place. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1407.98s)]
*  Commuting to her job is a hike. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1410.98s)]
*  The last couple of miles took us through some interesting terrain. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1413.98s)]
*  Okay, now we're going to enter the forest, and the advice I'd like to give everyone at this point [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1417.98s)]
*  is to stick together. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1421.98s)]
*  Stick together? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1423.98s)]
*  Yeah, because if we happen to run into elephants, we should all stay together and move in the [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1424.98s)]
*  same direction so we don't confuse them. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1427.98s)]
*  We don't want a confused elephant. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1429.98s)]
*  A confused elephant could be dangerous. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1431.98s)]
*  But unfortunately, running into one on the trail is rare. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1433.98s)]
*  So who made this trail, Andrea? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1436.98s)]
*  This was made by hundreds of years of elephant traffic in this forest. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1438.98s)]
*  Elephants made the trail? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1441.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean if you look at their feet, it's obviously, you know, they do a lot of road work. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1443.98s)]
*  The elephants have stumped out the equivalent of a vast interstate highway system. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1447.98s)]
*  It took us past giant teak trees through a thick, primordial forest. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1452.98s)]
*  Andrea has hiked this trail twice a day for nearly 20 years. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1457.98s)]
*  Where does it go? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1461.98s)]
*  We could hear something before we could see anything. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1462.98s)]
*  Suddenly, the trail ended, and right before us was an opening called the Dzanga Clearing [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1469.98s)]
*  and more than 50 forest elephants. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1476.98s)]
*  The setting was extraordinary, straight out of Jurassic Park, tranquil aside from an occasional roar. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1479.98s)]
*  Andrea, do you remember the very first time you saw this place? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1488.98s)]
*  Yeah, it was in the late 80s, and I actually slept here. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1491.98s)]
*  Slept here? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1495.98s)]
*  Yeah, and I slept on the ground in a tent. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1497.98s)]
*  And all night, there was this symphony of elephants. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1499.98s)]
*  And when I woke in the morning, it was like I had landed in paradise. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1503.98s)]
*  The clearing is a watering hole, a spa, and a sanctuary. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1507.98s)]
*  A place where elephants take their time. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1512.98s)]
*  The measured, graceful pace of the largest land animal on earth. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1515.98s)]
*  They come to the clearing for the minerals, which they can't seem to get enough of. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1521.98s)]
*  It's a place where elephants play. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1525.98s)]
*  These elephants are playing sort of amateur wrestling for pachyderms. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1527.98s)]
*  Nobody gets hurt. Kids fall and get up, the way kids do. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1532.98s)]
*  This elephant is giving himself a massage, a tree massage. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1537.98s)]
*  Here's one trying to hide unsuccessfully. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1542.98s)]
*  All this and so much more, observed by Andrea and others day after day. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1545.98s)]
*  It's been now 19 years that I've been observing this particular population of elephants. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1552.98s)]
*  Very long time. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1556.98s)]
*  Yeah, it is a long time, but it takes a long time to know elephants. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1557.98s)]
*  When Andrea first came here, she knew almost nothing about forest elephants. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1561.98s)]
*  Today, she's the world's leading expert on them. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1565.98s)]
*  From an observation deck on the edge of the clearing, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1569.98s)]
*  she collects scientific data for Cornell University and the Wildlife Conservation Society. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1572.98s)]
*  She watches elephants almost every day for hours, counting their numbers, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1578.98s)]
*  monitoring their health, and observing their social behavior. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1583.98s)]
*  What are the basic differences between the boys and the girls? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1587.98s)]
*  Females and their young stay together for longer periods of time. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1590.98s)]
*  As you can see, these groups are made up of adult females and they're young. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1594.98s)]
*  And bulls tend to leave their groups early and be solitary. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1597.98s)]
*  But they occasionally meet up with their families and speak to each other. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1600.98s)]
*  But the boys go off on their own and just sort of drop by now and then. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1603.98s)]
*  Yeah, they like adventure. They don't like the group life. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1606.98s)]
*  Are there other ways in which elephants are like us? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1610.98s)]
*  The females tend to be, like to be courted by older, experienced males. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1613.98s)]
*  Uh-huh, they don't like the young ones. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1617.98s)]
*  No, the young ones want to get to the point too quickly. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1619.98s)]
*  Now what are they making noise about right now? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1623.98s)]
*  That's the Penelope family. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1626.98s)]
*  And it's their way of saying hello. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1628.98s)]
*  Andrea knows it's the Penelope family because she named them and nearly a thousand other elephants. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1630.98s)]
*  She also recognizes them by their voices. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1636.98s)]
*  Voices researchers are trying to translate into what could someday become an elephant dictionary. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1639.98s)]
*  I find this elephant dictionary compiling exceedingly fascinating. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1645.98s)]
*  I mean, how large a dictionary will it be? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1650.98s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1653.98s)]
*  We have to really know a lot more about the behavior of these animals [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1654.98s)]
*  to sort of sort out these different vocalizations and what they mean. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1658.98s)]
*  Andrea's expertise brought her to the attention of Cornell University. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1662.98s)]
*  Peter Regge, a behavioral biologist from Cornell, says the dictionary is still in its early stages. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1666.98s)]
*  We're in kindergarten. We're just learning the very first few words. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1672.98s)]
*  And Andrea is going to help us put those words together. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1678.98s)]
*  You say we're in kindergarten now. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1683.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1685.98s)]
*  Are we in the process of compiling a child's dictionary? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1686.98s)]
*  Even an infant's dictionary. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1689.98s)]
*  It's a very, very complex process because we can't ask the elephant, what did you just say? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1692.98s)]
*  But they can match elephant sounds with behavior they can see [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1699.98s)]
*  and classify those sounds into distinct categories. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1703.98s)]
*  Can you tell me what some of them are? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1706.98s)]
*  Well, there's these low frequency rumbles. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1708.98s)]
*  It sounds like a big cat purring. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1710.98s)]
*  Those are the vocalizations that help keep groups in contact with each other. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1712.98s)]
*  There are protest calls. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1720.98s)]
*  In newborns, you have a particularly high cry. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1724.98s)]
*  And when you hear it, you know it's a very, very young calf. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1727.98s)]
*  And some of these big bulls, when they go into must, which is this sexual state, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1730.98s)]
*  they make a special rumble, which is very low and very pulsating. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1735.98s)]
*  Most days, Andrea works into the evenings, compiling data [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1744.98s)]
*  and exchanging information with researchers back in the U.S. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1748.98s)]
*  via the internet, which she also uses to stay in touch with home. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1751.98s)]
*  This is NPR Worldwide, program. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1755.98s)]
*  The archive of elephant behavior and sounds she's created is amazing and surprising. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1757.98s)]
*  These fearsome noises are actually elephants greeting one another. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1765.98s)]
*  Glad to see you. Come a little closer. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1769.98s)]
*  These are sounds of annoyance. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1774.98s)]
*  The big bulls are telling the youngsters to hit the road. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1778.98s)]
*  Back in the U.S., the elephant behavior is very different. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1782.98s)]
*  They're on the road. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1785.98s)]
*  Back in 2000, Andrea filmed the death of a baby [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1787.98s)]
*  and the traumatized cries of the other elephants. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1790.98s)]
*  These elephants kept poking the body over and over, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1793.98s)]
*  frantically trying to coax the baby back to life. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1796.98s)]
*  Then, the elephants formed a procession that filed past the body. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1800.98s)]
*  They'd feel it or they'd smell it, and then they'd vocalize. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1804.98s)]
*  It was like a funeral procession that went on three or four days. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1807.98s)]
*  Must have been an amazing sight. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1810.98s)]
*  They're trying to recognize death, and it upsets them. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1812.98s)]
*  It sort of brought home how emotional these animals are. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1815.98s)]
*  But it turns out that these vocalizations are just a small fraction [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1821.98s)]
*  of the sounds elephants make. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1825.98s)]
*  Until a few years ago, scientists had no idea [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1827.98s)]
*  that most of what elephants are saying can't be heard by the human ear. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1830.98s)]
*  The base of their vocalization is infrasonic. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1834.98s)]
*  In other words, the frequency on which their call is built [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1838.98s)]
*  is below what we can hear. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1842.98s)]
*  The elephants use those low sounds to find one another [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1844.98s)]
*  in the dense forests where they spend most of their time. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1847.98s)]
*  Elephants are using very low frequencies, which travel far. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1850.98s)]
*  How far? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1854.98s)]
*  At least two or three kilometers. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1856.98s)]
*  No kidding, more than a mile. Yes. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1858.98s)]
*  An elephant standing here can communicate with sound [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1860.98s)]
*  with an elephant more than a mile away. Yes. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1864.98s)]
*  Six thousand miles away, in upstate New York, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1869.98s)]
*  at a lab at Cornell University, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1872.98s)]
*  researchers are listening to everything from the sound of hummingbirds [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1874.98s)]
*  to the sound of whales. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1878.98s)]
*  The elephant listening project grew out of an accidental discovery [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1881.98s)]
*  made by its founder, Katie Payne, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1885.98s)]
*  one of the world's leading experts on elephant communication. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1887.98s)]
*  I love animals, right? So I went to the zoo. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1891.98s)]
*  The elephant cage. Elephant cage. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1894.98s)]
*  And I began to realize that I was feeling a throbbing in my ears [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1896.98s)]
*  and in the air that I couldn't really explain. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1900.98s)]
*  And I said, you know, do you suppose elephants are making sounds [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1904.98s)]
*  below the pitches that I can hear? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1909.98s)]
*  And we recorded for a month. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1911.98s)]
*  And lo and behold, we found that elephants had a great many sounds [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1914.98s)]
*  that people didn't know about. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1919.98s)]
*  She gave us examples of sounds that we can hear. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1920.98s)]
*  Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1923.98s)]
*  The sound which I interpret generally as everything is in order. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1930.98s)]
*  Everything's OK with the world? Everything's OK. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1937.98s)]
*  But then how do you discover the meaning of these sounds? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1940.98s)]
*  You just watch and watch and watch and record and record and record [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1943.98s)]
*  and keep the two together. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1947.98s)]
*  Which brings us back to Andrea. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1949.98s)]
*  Once or twice a year, she visits Cornell with her latest recordings. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1951.98s)]
*  And you're giving them the material with which they work? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1956.6200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1958.8600000000001s)]
*  This is a scene we filmed on the 1st of May, the first birth we witnessed in 19 years. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1959.8600000000001s)]
*  They're two females. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1964.78s)]
*  After oooing and eyeing over the new baby, as anyone would, the scientists get down to [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1966.94s)]
*  the business of figuring out what the elephant sounds mean. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1972.06s)]
*  I'm betting that these two calls are the same individual. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1976.14s)]
*  Figuring out which elephant is talking, where it's located, and what it's saying, has been [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1979.86s)]
*  a big challenge. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1984.4599999999998s)]
*  Researchers initially strung nine acoustic recording devices around the clearing. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1986.2199999999998s)]
*  As the sound reached each recorder at a different time, they could pinpoint the location of [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1990.8999999999999s)]
*  the speaking elephant. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1995.54s)]
*  Picking up sounds too low to hear was another challenge. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=1997.06s)]
*  But recording the sounds normally, and playing them back faster, was a revelation. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2000.4199999999998s)]
*  For example, the clearing at night sounds like this. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2005.46s)]
*  Played back three times faster, this is what the clearing sounds like. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2012.5s)]
*  You can hear the elephant's rumbling calls. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2022.14s)]
*  But to figure out what the calls mean, the Cornell team spends more time looking than [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2025.38s)]
*  Using these computer-generated spectrograms, they can see the low frequency sounds. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2030.66s)]
*  And then we can actually visually look at the calls. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2036.06s)]
*  And what does this visualization tell us? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2039.6200000000001s)]
*  It tells us that there's incredible complexity. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2042.1000000000001s)]
*  Many of their calls are actually similar in some ways to human speech. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2045.14s)]
*  Peter, does all this research into elephant sounds have any practical purpose? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2048.42s)]
*  We're using sound recordings to monitor forest elephants because they're so difficult to [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2054.98s)]
*  see. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2059.66s)]
*  And this becomes more and more critical because their population is threatened. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2060.66s)]
*  So knowing where the animals are gives us a way to begin attacking what has to be preserved [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2064.94s)]
*  or where do we need to put more protection. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2072.26s)]
*  Protection because poaching has become almost epidemic. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2074.7s)]
*  It's estimated that annually 10% of Zanga's elephants are killed for their ivory. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2078.06s)]
*  Peter works closely with Zanga's armed guards, but so far, their efforts have not stopped the slaughter. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2084.22s)]
*  Do you see it as your personal responsibility to protect the elephants here? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2090.22s)]
*  I've made it my personal responsibility. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2094.22s)]
*  For me, if I've been given this great privilege to study this particular population of elephants, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2096.38s)]
*  I think my priority is to protect them. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2101.7s)]
*  Otherwise, I have no right to study them. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2104.5s)]
*  Excuse me, we have a vocalization. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2107.06s)]
*  That's a protest. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2110.66s)]
*  A protest. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2111.66s)]
*  It's a protest that's probably being refused something by its mother. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2113.22s)]
*  Baby elephants protest in a rather loud fashion, don't they? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2115.22s)]
*  Yeah, they're just like little bratty children. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2118.22s)]
*  Andrea believes if she weren't here, the clearing would become a killing field. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2123.22s)]
*  It's clear that in a very pragmatic sense, you are saving the elephants. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2128.22s)]
*  But in another sense, they've saved me. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2134.22s)]
*  I have something very important in my life to do, and I think a lot of people don't get [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2136.8199999999997s)]
*  to do that. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2140.22s)]
*  Andrea plans to stay here at least another 15 years. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2143.22s)]
*  And as night falls over her clearing and fishermen float gently down the sangha, you can hear [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2146.22s)]
*  the crickets. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2152.02s)]
*  What you can't hear are the elephants. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2153.02s)]
*  But that doesn't mean they aren't talking. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2156.2599999999998s)]
*  Can you imagine an orphanage that's a happy place? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2172.74s)]
*  We couldn't, but then we found one. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2176.74s)]
*  The kids don't arrive here smiling like orphans all over the world. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2179.2599999999998s)]
*  They've been abandoned. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2183.3399999999997s)]
*  They're hungry, sad, and desperate. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2184.3399999999997s)]
*  But after a few years, they're healthy, well-fed, and well, happy. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2187.2999999999997s)]
*  The orphanage is in Kenya, outside Nairobi. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2192.62s)]
*  And we might as well tell you now, it's an orphanage for elephants. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2195.8599999999997s)]
*  They've been orphaned because their parents, their mothers mainly, have died or more likely [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2201.26s)]
*  been killed in the bush. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2205.94s)]
*  Poachers kill large elephants with their ivory. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2207.98s)]
*  A young elephant can only survive a day or two without milk. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2210.98s)]
*  So the orphanage's first job is to find the orphans, fly them to the orphanage, and before [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2214.42s)]
*  anything else, feed them. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2219.7400000000002s)]
*  The principal of the orphanage, the principal, headmistress, head nurse, and CEO is Dame [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2223.7s)]
*  Daphne Sheldrick. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2230.38s)]
*  She founded the place, has been working with elephants for 50 years. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2231.38s)]
*  This is little Seguta. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2235.7400000000002s)]
*  This is the one that was in a coma when she arrived. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2236.9s)]
*  It was on a drip for 24 hours. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2239.7000000000003s)]
*  We never thought she'd be alive in the morning. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2243.34s)]
*  So she's our little miracle, this one. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2246.14s)]
*  But Daphne's problem is that she's caring for too many miracles. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2249.2200000000003s)]
*  Poachers are killing more and more elephants for their tusks, creating more and more orphans. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2253.46s)]
*  There's a record number of orphans here right now because, Daphne says, the sale of ivory [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2259.1400000000003s)]
*  has been legalized for the first time in 10 years. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2263.82s)]
*  A few African countries have been given the right to sell their ivory stockpiles more [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2267.5400000000004s)]
*  than 100 tons of tusks to China and Japan. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2272.5s)]
*  And conservationists point out this is yet another blow to Africa's elephants. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2276.5s)]
*  Do you see any correlation between the decision to auction off the ivory and the number of [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2281.6600000000003s)]
*  orphans? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2287.2200000000003s)]
*  We do. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2288.66s)]
*  Every time ivory is auctioned legally, there's a rise in poaching. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2289.66s)]
*  And we also see the correlation in the price that's paid to the poacher for illegal ivory. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2294.1s)]
*  Is the price going up? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2298.7799999999997s)]
*  It's gone from 300 shillings a kilo to 5,000. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2300.1s)]
*  That's about $1,000 a tusk. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2303.8199999999997s)]
*  And in Kenya, the number of elephants killed by poachers has increased by 45% this year [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2306.54s)]
*  alone. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2312.4199999999996s)]
*  A rather amazing rise, isn't it? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2313.4199999999996s)]
*  It is. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2315.2999999999997s)]
*  It's a scary, frightening rise. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2316.38s)]
*  Poachers were behind the death of this elephant. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2319.34s)]
*  Her trunk was caught in one of their snares, and she had no way of feeding herself or her [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2321.42s)]
*  six-week-old baby boy. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2326.7000000000003s)]
*  He just couldn't accept the fact that his mother was dead, so he continued trying to [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2329.1000000000004s)]
*  suckle. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2333.46s)]
*  Eventually, the keepers got him to drink their milk. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2334.46s)]
*  They called him Shimba, and he was in such bad shape that nobody thought he would survive. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2337.6200000000003s)]
*  But then he was brought to the orphanage, and things began going his way. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2343.9s)]
*  He's 27 months old now and is in very good shape, very muscular, very strong, and he's [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2348.18s)]
*  beginning to grow tusks. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2354.2599999999998s)]
*  He never stops eating. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2355.98s)]
*  In fact, that's the first love of every orphan here, eating. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2357.46s)]
*  The institution has a dining area, and that's not all. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2362.16s)]
*  As we found out when we first dropped by here three years ago, it has everything you'd want [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2365.54s)]
*  in an orphanage. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2370.5s)]
*  Dormitories. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2371.7s)]
*  Each orphan has a private room, a communal bath, and a playground. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2372.7s)]
*  The regimen at the orphanage is anything but Dickensian. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2378.14s)]
*  Unlike Oliver Twist, when one of these orphans asks for more, that's what he gets, more. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2382.1s)]
*  Ultimately, Daphne finds elephants more sympathetic than people. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2388.42s)]
*  What is the most extraordinary thing you have learned about elephants? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2393.22s)]
*  Their tremendous capacity for caring is, I think, perhaps the most amazing thing about [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2396.9s)]
*  them, even at a very, very young age. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2402.82s)]
*  Their sort of forgiveness, unselfishness. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2405.58s)]
*  So you know, I often say, as I think I've said before, they have all the best attributes [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2409.7000000000003s)]
*  of us humans and not very many of the bad. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2414.7000000000003s)]
*  Just about the best people you've ever met are the gentlemen who work here. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2418.7000000000003s)]
*  Keepers they're called, and they have extraordinary jobs. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2422.7000000000003s)]
*  There is one keeper per elephant. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2425.3799999999997s)]
*  He'll spend 24 hours a day with his charge, seven days a week. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2427.46s)]
*  The keeper feeds his elephant every three hours, day and night, just like mom would. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2431.22s)]
*  He keeps his elephant warm, not like mom would, but with a blanket. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2436.1s)]
*  And when it's sleep time, he beds down right next to his elephant. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2440.3399999999997s)]
*  If he leaves, if ever so briefly, the baby wakes up and broadcasts his displeasure. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2444.18s)]
*  The keepers are rotated now and then so that no elephant gets too terribly attached to [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2450.92s)]
*  any one of them. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2455.34s)]
*  At dawn, the elephants are taken from their dorms out to the bush. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2461.44s)]
*  They hang out for a while, play some games. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2464.6s)]
*  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2467.1600000000003s)]
*  Soccer is a favorite. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2472.1600000000003s)]
*  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2473.1600000000003s)]
*  And guess who decides when it's halftime. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2476.04s)]
*  The days are pretty much the same here, but on Fridays, the orphanage becomes a spa. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2481.76s)]
*  You want to rub her down? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2488.28s)]
*  Go on, rub her down. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2489.8s)]
*  The keepers give the elephants a coconut oil massage. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2492.84s)]
*  We can't do exactly what the mother can do, but we do something close to that. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2497.9s)]
*  You're a surrogate mother. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2501.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2502.96s)]
*  King Lucici is the head of the keepers. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2503.96s)]
*  He is the chief elephant man. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2506.32s)]
*  This one here is Lwaleni. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2509.2200000000003s)]
*  Lwaleni is the oldest female we have, 16 months as well. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2511.2200000000003s)]
*  The tiny one here is Makena. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2517.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2521.28s)]
*  They always want to be close with Lwaleni. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2522.28s)]
*  Yes, well, they always want to be close to each other and to you, don't they? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2525.56s)]
*  I'm afraid this interview with Edmund is getting rudely interrupted, but there's really not [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2531.96s)]
*  that much to do. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2537.64s)]
*  There may be little, there may be orphans, but trust me, they're not as little as they [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2538.64s)]
*  look. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2542.08s)]
*  In fact, I feel like I'm in an elephant sandwich. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2543.08s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2546.76s)]
*  Perhaps the problem was we had not been properly introduced. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2549.44s)]
*  There is a protocol to meeting an elephant. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2553.32s)]
*  He will offer up his trunk and he expects you to blow in it. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2555.96s)]
*  That way, he will remember your scent forever. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2559.82s)]
*  You will never be strangers again. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2563.2400000000002s)]
*  The little baby's been captured. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2565.26s)]
*  The orphanage gets distress calls from all over Kenya, from all over East Africa, that [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2568.28s)]
*  a baby elephant is on his own, often because his mother has been killed by a poacher. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2573.1400000000003s)]
*  It is then a matter of great urgency. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2578.86s)]
*  An orphaned elephant can only survive a few days without his mother. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2581.1000000000004s)]
*  The baby elephant is loaded onto a plane and flown back to Daphne Sheldrick's orphanage [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2585.94s)]
*  outside Nairobi, where he'll stay until he's strong enough to go back into the bush. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2591.1s)]
*  Dame Daphne has been running the orphanage for almost 30 years. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2599.1s)]
*  She was born and raised in Kenya and married David Sheldrick, Africa's leading crusader [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2603.34s)]
*  against poaching. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2609.02s)]
*  When he died in 1977, she founded the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2610.64s)]
*  Daphne saw her mission as saving as many elephants as possible, but she has never permitted herself [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2616.72s)]
*  too much hope. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2622.48s)]
*  That's because she loses half the elephants that arrive here, some from pneumonia, some [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2623.48s)]
*  from trauma. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2628.92s)]
*  This elephant probably witnessed its mother's death and remembers everything. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2630.22s)]
*  It's the double-edged sword of having the memory of an elephant they never forget. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2635.12s)]
*  You know, he's still grieving for his elephant family. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2639.8399999999997s)]
*  He's in shock. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2643.96s)]
*  He's distressed. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2644.96s)]
*  Do you believe a baby elephant can die of grief? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2645.96s)]
*  Oh, yes, I know it can. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2648.64s)]
*  They're terribly, terribly fragile. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2651.24s)]
*  You've got to try and turn the psyche around, duplicating what that elephant would have [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2652.96s)]
*  had in an elephant family, touching them, talking to them gently. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2657.0s)]
*  In other words, love. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2661.44s)]
*  Tender loving care, TLC, and a lot of it. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2663.36s)]
*  Daphne and the keepers may run this place officially, but it's the elephants who are [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2666.52s)]

*  For example, when a new keeper is hired, he's on probation for three months. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2672.6200000000003s)]
*  Then, if the elephants like him, he's got a job. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2677.36s)]
*  If not, he's out. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2680.76s)]
*  What do you try to teach them? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2682.88s)]
*  Well, we have to teach them not to be naughty, not to push around with the others, to obey [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2684.08s)]
*  one another, just like you have to do to your children, your own children, to respect the [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2690.48s)]
*  others. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2695.44s)]
*  And the keepers teach the elephants how to be elephants. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2696.44s)]
*  There are wild elephant things these kids don't know how to do. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2699.6800000000003s)]
*  Mother wasn't around to teach them, things like covering themselves in dust to prevent [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2703.32s)]
*  sunburn. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2708.04s)]
*  The keepers do it with shovels until the elephants pick it up themselves. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2710.4s)]
*  The orphanage has an infirmary, and the doctor has a call to make. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2716.2s)]
*  One of the elephants is not doing well at all. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2720.3199999999997s)]
*  He's been on antibiotics for two days now, but he can barely breathe. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2723.3599999999997s)]
*  All this froth that's coming out of his throat has got to be pulmonary edema. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2727.52s)]
*  His room looks like an intensive care unit. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2732.06s)]
*  The doctor, Daphne, and the keepers don't leave him for a minute. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2734.52s)]
*  They do everything they can, but it's not enough. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2740.48s)]
*  By dawn, he is dead. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2745.08s)]
*  How do you manage going through this all the time? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2748.08s)]
*  Well, you don't have much option, do you? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2755.08s)]
*  There's another one to look after, and then another one coming, and you know, you just [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2758.0s)]
*  have to turn the page. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2763.56s)]
*  And you get attached after one... [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2768.36s)]
*  But I'm not very good at it. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2769.36s)]
*  And you're not going to get any better, are you? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2770.36s)]
*  No. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2772.56s)]
*  Not after 50 years. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2773.56s)]
*  But then you go and you hang out with the orphans who are doing so well, and it brings [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2775.04s)]
*  joy to your life. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2780.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2782.08s)]
*  It's actually a pretty lush life for these elephants here at the orphanage, but it's [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2783.08s)]
*  not the life of a wild elephant. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2787.56s)]
*  It's not their destiny. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2789.52s)]
*  So, like any good school, this place prepares its students to leave to get ready for life [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2790.52s)]
*  in the real world, to go back to the wild from whence they came. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2795.6s)]
*  This young lady left Daphne's orphanage to go live in the wild. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2801.3s)]
*  Her name is Mpenzi, and a couple of years ago, she became pregnant and decided to go [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2805.04s)]
*  off on her own to give birth, without the protection of her extended family. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2810.0s)]
*  That was a mistake. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2815.7400000000002s)]
*  Before the sun could set, Mpenzi and her baby were surrounded by a pride of 16 lions. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2818.0600000000004s)]
*  Keeper Joseph Sauny was called to the scene and captured the events on his still camera. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2824.98s)]
*  Some pens were standing there trying to scare off lions with their trunk. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2830.22s)]
*  But when they came, she tried to push them on this side, others come on the back. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2835.4399999999996s)]
*  Mpenzi didn't have a chance. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2839.74s)]
*  How did you and the other keepers react? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2841.8599999999997s)]
*  It was so, so sad. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2843.7999999999997s)]
*  In fact, everybody was crying. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2845.2999999999997s)]
*  And there was nothing they could do to save the baby. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2848.2599999999998s)]
*  It was a brutal lesson for Mpenzi. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2850.9199999999996s)]
*  Nature has its own laws. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2853.8999999999996s)]
*  They're a long way from the sheltered world of the orphanage. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2855.3599999999997s)]
*  But this story has a happy ending. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2859.48s)]
*  Just days before we arrived, Mpenzi gave birth to another little girl. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2862.2s)]
*  The keepers have all come out to cheer her on. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2867.4s)]
*  They named her Asante, which in Swahili means thank you. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2871.2400000000002s)]
*  Mpenzi has learned her lesson. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2879.6s)]
*  This time she makes sure her bundle of joy is surrounded by other members of the family. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2881.4s)]
*  They help her up when she falls down and rescue her when she tumbles into a mud hole. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2886.8s)]
*  So for the moment, Asante will be safe, at least until she grows tusks. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2892.82s)]
*  And low before the flood, the Lord said to Noah, make yourself an ark, bring out every [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2909.9s)]
*  kind of living creature. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2914.7000000000003s)]
*  That was the Old Testament. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2916.72s)]
*  But what happens today when disaster threatens animals? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2918.5s)]
*  A powerful force, a zoo, a foreign government, even the US Department of Justice, often calls [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2921.54s)]
*  for them on high and enlists the services of one man, Pat Craig, founder of the Wild Animal [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2926.52s)]
*  Sanctuary in Colorado, who's emerged as the go-to guy for orchestrating high-stakes rescues [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2932.2799999999997s)]
*  around the world. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2938.3399999999997s)]
*  Last spring, we accompanied this modern-day Noah to his zoo in Puerto Rico for his most [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2939.9599999999996s)]
*  ambitious mission yet. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2944.46s)]
*  These lions were once literally the pride of Puerto Rico, housed at the Dr. Juane Rivero [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2948.86s)]
*  Zoo in the coastal town of Mayaguez, the only zoo on the island. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2954.18s)]
*  But after years of decline, mismanagement and neglect, this was the tableau that greeted [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2959.58s)]
*  Pat Craig and his wife Monica when they arrived here from Colorado. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2965.14s)]
*  What was your impression when you got to the zoo for the first time? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2969.5s)]
*  The animals were very, very sad-looking and some of them were very, very sick. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2973.2s)]
*  I felt physically and emotionally overwhelmed. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2978.4399999999996s)]
*  And even while we were there, animals died almost on a weekly basis. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2982.7999999999997s)]
*  So that felt even worse because we're present and yet we were there too late. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2986.0s)]
*  Over the course of a decade, the US Department of Agriculture cited the zoo two dozen times [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2991.1s)]
*  for substandard conditions and animal mistreatment. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=2996.08s)]
*  After hurricanes Irma and Maria ravaged the island, the zoo closed to the public in 2018. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3000.36s)]
*  For the more than 300 winged, scaled and four-legged residents still captive, the situation turned [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3006.52s)]
*  from bad to downright desperate. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3013.6400000000003s)]
*  We saw a zebra that had a horrible wound on her leg and her tail and she couldn't stand [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3016.5s)]
*  up. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3021.9s)]
*  We saw a pig that had a skin condition. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3022.9s)]
*  Her skin was just falling apart. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3025.1400000000003s)]
*  A mountain lion's untreated cancer had been allowed to spread all over its body. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3027.14s)]
*  Seeing the mountain lion suffering the way that he was, that broke my heart and I mean [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3032.02s)]
*  able to, sorry. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3036.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, help him. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3038.9s)]
*  It was just so evident that this facility was way beyond repair. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3041.62s)]
*  The US Department of Justice, which enforces federal animal welfare laws in the states [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3047.46s)]
*  in Puerto Rico, agreed and in February staged an extraordinary intervention, sending a battalion [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3052.26s)]
*  of agents to the zoo to evacuate every single species to permanent homes on the mainland. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3058.46s)]
*  To lead this mission, to captain this arc as it were, the DOJ tapped wild animal sanctuary [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3065.1800000000003s)]
*  founder Pat Craig. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3071.6400000000003s)]
*  We were there in April to witness the operation, equal parts military-style logistics and battlefield [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3074.42s)]
*  extraction. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3081.66s)]
*  Among the targets, seven lions sweltering in a concrete bunker. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3083.62s)]
*  And they never hooked up the power after the hurricane and they never hooked up the power [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3088.1s)]
*  to the zoo. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3091.42s)]
*  Never. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3092.42s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3093.42s)]
*  There's a zoo that's functioning with animals there and there's no power? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3094.42s)]
*  There's no power. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3096.7799999999997s)]
*  And then if you look at the pictures from the inside of their building, you know, it's [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3097.96s)]
*  the old steel bars, just like jail cells, while in a row. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3101.18s)]
*  When it came time to coax the cats out of their cages, Craig entered the lion's den. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3104.8999999999996s)]
*  To gather the lions weren't necessarily happy to see you and go with you. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3110.8599999999997s)]
*  What happened? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3114.4599999999996s)]
*  They're definitely defensive because they don't know who we are and what we're doing [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3115.4599999999996s)]
*  and why. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3118.14s)]
*  And so we show up and we're like, believe me, you got to trust me, we're trying to [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3119.14s)]
*  help you here. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3121.58s)]
*  Done. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3122.74s)]
*  Done. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3123.74s)]
*  The sweet talking didn't work. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3124.74s)]
*  So they deployed plan B, sedation. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3127.4199999999996s)]
*  Hard to watch, but accepted practice when rescuing uncooperative carnivores. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3130.8999999999996s)]
*  Over the course of five months, Craig and his team of 20 used patience, prodding, pursuit, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3136.66s)]
*  and grape jelly to lure each animal into its custom-built crate. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3145.66s)]
*  A camel. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3151.62s)]
*  A kangaroo. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3152.62s)]
*  A rhinoceros. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3154.62s)]
*  These stubborn hippos. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3157.14s)]
*  Monica Craig, a native Spanish speaker, had hoped to coordinate with the local staff. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3159.02s)]
*  But the team from Colorado mostly had to go it alone. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3164.78s)]

*  We tried many, many days to communicate with them and trying to tell them, hey, we're not [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3172.6200000000003s)]
*  bad people. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3178.5400000000004s)]
*  We're just trying to do what we're supposed to be doing for these animals and give them [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3179.5400000000004s)]
*  a better home. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3182.78s)]
*  What was the response to that? [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3183.78s)]
*  They were upset. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3185.1800000000003s)]
*  They were like, no, I don't think, I don't think that's right. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3186.1800000000003s)]
*  The animals belong here. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3189.5400000000004s)]
*  It was a sentiment shared by many in the community, and at times resistance curdled into outright [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3192.14s)]
*  sabotage. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3197.98s)]
*  The rescue team had nearly wrangled Mundy, once a star attraction, into her transport [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3199.8199999999997s)]
*  crate when suddenly... [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3204.8399999999997s)]
*  Out of nowhere, this elephant just flies up, tears out of there, starts running around. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3206.9s)]
*  What do you think happened? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3212.46s)]
*  Well, I think somebody shot her with a BB gun, if you ask me. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3213.46s)]
*  And hit her in the rear end? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3216.02s)]
*  Hit her in the rear end just to make her hate that crate. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3217.02s)]
*  Yep. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3218.98s)]
*  She thinks that crate did something to her. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3219.98s)]
*  We reached out to Puerto Rico's Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, which [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3222.34s)]
*  is responsible for the zoo. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3226.82s)]
*  In a statement, it said the animals were provided with comprehensive care and denied there was [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3229.02s)]
*  any neglect, blaming problems at the zoo on hurricane damage, limited resources, and aging [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3233.7400000000002s)]
*  animals. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3240.82s)]
*  Once the transport was finally ready, a police escort to the airport. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3242.3s)]
*  Then the animals were loaded, one by one, onto charter flights bound for new homes [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3247.3s)]
*  Craig had arranged at sanctuaries across the U.S. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3252.1000000000004s)]
*  How do you ferry to safety an 8,000 pound elephant like Mundy? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3256.1400000000003s)]
*  On a 747 cargo jet, of course. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3260.9s)]
*  Departure brought a sigh of relief. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3265.1000000000004s)]
*  When she took off, I cried because I said, thank you God, she's in, it's over, she's [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3267.6600000000003s)]
*  out of here. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3273.78s)]
*  There's no question about it anymore. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3274.78s)]
*  Pat and Monica Craig took as many of the rescues as they could back to their 1,200 acre facility. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3277.2599999999998s)]
*  A vast menagerie roams the grassy enclosures on the high plains of eastern Colorado. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3283.18s)]
*  Each of the 700 plus animals here came with a sad backstory, wagging their own tales of [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3288.94s)]
*  woe, as it were. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3294.5s)]
*  Tigers kept in garages as pets. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3296.2999999999997s)]
*  Lions saved from a zoo in war-torn Ukraine. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3299.14s)]
*  Bears abused at a Korean medical facility. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3302.46s)]
*  Now 64, Craig got the idea for the place as a teenager in the 1970s, when a friend who [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3306.1s)]
*  worked at a zoo gave him a tour behind the scenes. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3311.56s)]
*  There were all these animals, lions and tigers, that were in small cages and he said these [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3314.98s)]
*  will be euthanized and I thought, wow, this is crazy, you know, these are healthy, they're [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3319.02s)]
*  not old, they're not sick. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3323.2999999999997s)]
*  Craig decided right then and there to open his own sanctuary on his parents' small Colorado [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3325.14s)]
*  farm. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3329.8199999999997s)]
*  With few regulations to guide him, he built the animal enclosures himself and scoured [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3331.34s)]
*  biology books for pointers. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3336.1400000000003s)]
*  Did you have any experience with lions and tigers? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3338.38s)]
*  No, none. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3341.38s)]
*  Did you have a degree in zoology? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3342.38s)]
*  No, I was just starting college back then, it was going to be a business degree. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3344.2200000000003s)]
*  And he quickly learned that lions and tigers are no house cats. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3348.54s)]
*  In the early years, I was in the hospital more times than you could count. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3352.42s)]
*  It was like, okay, don't do that again, and you know, so all those years of making mistakes [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3355.38s)]
*  and not getting killed. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3360.06s)]
*  What specifically does a mistake look like? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3361.58s)]
*  Pretty bad. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3363.86s)]
*  I've had my left arm almost completely torn off. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3364.86s)]
*  I've had bit through the chest and collapsed lungs. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3366.58s)]
*  The animals Craig can handle, but on his missions to hostile environments around the world, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3369.7799999999997s)]
*  it's the people he often needs extra help managing. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3375.06s)]
*  Heavily armed federal marshals accompanied Craig when the Department of Justice dispatched [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3379.22s)]
*  him to retrieve maltreated big cats that had been kept by the notorious Tiger King. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3383.98s)]
*  Joe Exotic, the unlikely Netflix sensation, and his associates. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3389.82s)]
*  These two are among the 141 animals Craig liberated and brought back here. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3395.6600000000003s)]
*  What kind of conditions was Joe Exotic keeping these guys in in Oklahoma? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3400.82s)]
*  Well, you know, it was just all these really small cages that were just in line after line [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3404.9s)]
*  because it was a gigantic breeding operation primarily. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3410.46s)]
*  The rescue missions and the sanctuary operate on an annual budget of $34 million, funding [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3413.86s)]
*  comes mostly from private donations. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3419.54s)]
*  When animals arrive here, this is often their first stop, designed to minimize shock by [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3422.7799999999997s)]
*  mimicking the conditions they came from. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3428.42s)]
*  Here they're evaluated and given a treatment plan, whether it's medication or emergency [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3431.46s)]
*  surgery. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3436.46s)]
*  Craig and staff veterinarian Dr. Michaela Vettors introduced us to Chad and Malawi, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3437.66s)]
*  both rescued from Puerto Rico. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3442.94s)]
*  How confident do we feel about our locks here? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3444.94s)]
*  Confident. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3447.1s)]
*  This guy wants to get out. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3448.1s)]
*  This guy's ready to hang out with us. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3449.66s)]
*  They suffer from permanent neurological damage, likely caused by malnutrition, something Craig [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3451.58s)]
*  could spot just by looking. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3457.22s)]
*  You see how she keeps doing that? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3459.22s)]
*  Yeah, at an angle. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3460.22s)]
*  Really, she just doesn't have control over it. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3461.22s)]
*  Head tilting at an angle. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3462.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we've had literally hundreds of lions that have come through that have had that [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3463.7799999999997s)]
*  kind of problem. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3467.66s)]
*  You've seen this before. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3468.66s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3469.66s)]
*  The sanctuary devises a special diet for each animal, which requires 100,000 pounds of food [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3470.66s)]
*  per week, mainly donated by nearby Walmarts, occasional cupcakes included. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3477.18s)]
*  When we met him, Mikey the bear, another asylum seeker from Puerto Rico, was midway through [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3483.5s)]
*  his rehab. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3488.2999999999997s)]
*  Right now he's in his lockout just so we can medically manage him. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3489.8599999999997s)]
*  What did you see the first time you saw him? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3493.94s)]
*  He was in a great deal of pain, very gingerly moving. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3495.98s)]
*  We assume he's got a great deal of arthritis, which we've provided medications for, and [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3499.8599999999997s)]
*  now he's getting around almost like a young bear. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3504.94s)]
*  Nursing animals like Mikey back to physical health is one thing. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3507.62s)]
*  Ministering to their emotional wounds is often a bigger challenge. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3511.58s)]
*  Having been raised in captivity, many of the animals arrive with what amounts to severe [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3514.98s)]
*  PTSD, and they must be taught to trust the humans caring for them. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3519.7s)]
*  They're already mad at people anyway because of whatever people had done. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3525.2599999999998s)]
*  I had one tiger years ago that anytime you came near, he'd want to hit the fence and [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3528.86s)]
*  kill you. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3532.1s)]
*  What's the time table for trying to ease some of the trauma these animals have been through? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3533.1s)]
*  Some were beaten, some were starved, some were mentally tormented to a degree. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3537.86s)]
*  Every case is different. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3544.54s)]
*  Some of them will do it in a matter of days, some will be in a few weeks. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3546.1s)]
*  Doesn't that story imply, however traumatic this may have been, it's not irreversible? [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3549.2999999999997s)]
*  It's not irreversible. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3554.46s)]
*  The goal of all this rehab is to get these wild animals to act the part. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3556.2999999999997s)]
*  Remember Mundy? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3562.4599999999996s)]
*  At the zoo she had zero contact with other elephants for more than 30 years. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3563.4599999999996s)]
*  We accompanied Craig on a visit to a refuge in Georgia where he placed Mundy under the [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3569.06s)]
*  care of conservationist Carol Buckley. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3573.22s)]
*  This marked the first time Craig and the elephant had seen each other since Puerto Rico. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3576.5s)]
*  What do you notice? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3580.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, first thing, she just looks so much healthier and just her demeanor is so much [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3581.8199999999997s)]
*  calmer and nicer. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3586.62s)]
*  Every day when I would go see her in the zoo, I just got hurt. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3588.5s)]
*  And then now to see this is just amazing. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3591.9s)]
*  Just truly amazing. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3594.46s)]
*  Hey pretty lady. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3595.46s)]
*  Buckley provides the care and feeding, but happily admits Mundy's real mentors are the [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3597.06s)]
*  other elephants here. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3602.1s)]
*  You're just the innkeeper. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3603.1s)]
*  You're just the chef. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3604.1s)]
*  That's right. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3605.1s)]
*  Hey, I just open and close doors and make sure the waters are running, you know. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3606.1s)]
*  And the other elephant knows what they need to learn and they're instructing them. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3610.06s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3613.98s)]
*  It's exactly the same as what happens in the wild. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3615.02s)]
*  That's the same principle Craig employs at his sanctuary. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3619.5s)]
*  And after two months of rehab, the lions from Puerto Rico were ready to enter their permanent [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3623.58s)]
*  habitat. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3628.5s)]
*  All right, Robert's going to open the door. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3629.5s)]
*  We were on hand for the release. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3632.54s)]
*  No one quite knew what to expect, not least the lions. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3634.58s)]
*  You can go. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3638.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3639.02s)]
*  The first was reticent. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3640.02s)]
*  But one by one, this must just be literally life changing. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3642.88s)]
*  They started to venture out, enclosed for their safety and ours, but otherwise in a [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3647.28s)]
*  vast ocean of green. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3652.2400000000002s)]
*  These guys have been in captivity their whole lives. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3654.2000000000003s)]
*  This is the first. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3656.4s)]
*  Yeah, this will be the first time ever that they've been able to either run or live in [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3657.4s)]
*  a big space like this, even have deep grass. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3661.56s)]
*  Makes you feel good? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3664.08s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3665.36s)]
*  This is why we do this. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3666.44s)]
*  There were a few scuffles, but for Pat Craig, that's exactly what he'd hoped for. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3668.92s)]
*  Lions acting like, well, lions. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3673.84s)]
*  The animals come to the sanctuary from all over the world. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3676.86s)]
*  But in this unlikely setting here, silhouetted by the Rockies in Eastern Colorado, they find [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3680.3s)]
*  more than just sanctuary. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3686.62s)]
*  They finally find a home. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNag3rJVw0&t=3688.66s)]
