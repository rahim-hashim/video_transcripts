*  we've never interviewed one until now [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Charles Cullen was a critical care nurse who admits to killing up to 40 people [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=28.040000000000003s)]

*  in seven different hospitals there were suspicions that nearly all of them [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=38.0s)]
*  that Cullen was harming patients yet none of them passed that information on [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  to subsequent employers newspaper headlines called him [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  the angel of death but as you will see Charles Cullen was no mercy killer [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=50.4s)]
*  until we interviewed him a few weeks ago he'd never spoken publicly about his [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=54.72s)]
*  crimes [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=59.24s)]
*  never tried to explain why he did it or even express remorse [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=59.96s)]
*  to the families of victims when he finally face them in court [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=64.44s)]
*  this monster didn't even know us [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=67.68s)]
*  or our son but had the audacity to end his life [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=70.8s)]
*  I like to tell you a little bit about my mother that you murdered [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=74.8s)]
*  you don't even have the guts to look this way do you [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=77.88s)]
*  Charles why don't you look up at us I like to show you what you did to our children [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=81.8s)]
*  this is their dad and his coffin how do you like that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=86.36s)]
*  this was the scene seven years ago at the Somerset County Courthouse in New [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=89.64s)]
*  Jersey [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  as Charles Cullen sat through his sentencing hearing [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  refusing to speak or even acknowledge the family members [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=98.6s)]
*  of people he had murdered even the judge was exasperated [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=102.36s)]
*  Cullen I ask you a question why is it that you have chosen not to address the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=107.08s)]
*  court [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=111.16s)]
*  can you hear me Mr. Cullen? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=111.48s)]
*  he's kept that silence behind the walls of the New Jersey State Prison in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  Trenton [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=119.56s)]
*  where he is in protective custody to keep him safe from other inmates [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=120.12s)]
*  protecting himself from his own demons has been more difficult [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=124.16s)]
*  we found out when we sat down across from him in a cramped cubicle [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=128.36s)]
*  separated by a thick layer of glass to talk about the people he's killed [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=132.8s)]
*  is 40 an arbitrary number? 40 is an estimate [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  I gave you a number between 30 and 40 I think I have identified [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=142.88s)]
*  you know most of them [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=147.16s)]
*  look you you you pled guilty to murder you don't use that word [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  I think I had a lot of trouble accepting that word for a long time [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=156.68s)]
*  I accept that that's what it is do you consider yourself a serial killer? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean I guess it depends upon [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  a person's definition if it's more than one and it's a pattern I guess then [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=173.88s)]
*  yes in Cullen's case all of his victims were patients assigned to hospital units [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=179.44s)]
*  where he worked as a nurse [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  they ranged in age from 21 to 91 [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=186.24s)]
*  some were critically ill others were ready to be discharged when Cullen [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=189.84s)]
*  injected them with drugs that would kill them [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=194.32s)]
*  it was a pattern that began 26 years ago [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=196.56s)]
*  at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=200.12s)]
*  Cullen's very first nursing job I worked on the burn unit so [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=203.4s)]
*  I mean there was a lot of pain a lot of suffering and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=207.96s)]
*  I didn't cope with that as well as I thought I would [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=212.68s)]
*  and that was the first place that you gave [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=215.96s)]
*  so in medication that caused them to die [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=219.64s)]
*  the patient was John Yengo a judge from New Jersey who was suffering from a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=221.64s)]
*  severe case of sunburn [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=226.44s)]
*  until Cullen injected him with a fatal overdose [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  of lidocaine. Do you remember the person? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=231.0s)]
*  I remember one and that's the only person I've been able to identify [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=236.0s)]
*  but there could have been more St. Barnabas didn't know about the patient [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=239.64s)]
*  Cullen murdered [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=244.0s)]
*  but it did suspect him of trying to kill or harm [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=244.83999999999997s)]
*  a half a dozen other patients by randomly and repeatedly [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  poisoning bags of saline solution. Someone was spiking [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=251.76s)]
*  IV bags with insulin in the store room. Charles Graber [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=255.32s)]
*  a New York writer as well as a former medical student and researcher [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=258.44s)]
*  has spent seven years investigating Cullen's murders [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=262.2s)]
*  for a new book called The Good Nurse. Graber says a number of patients at St. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=265.36s)]
*  Barnabas went into insulin shock [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=270.2s)]
*  and nearly died. He was the main suspect for [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=272.04s)]
*  poisoning random bags of saline. If you [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=275.44s)]
*  if you talk to the investigators there they'll tell you Cullen was our man we [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=279.64s)]
*  knew he was dirty [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=283.23999999999995s)]
*  they couldn't prove anything it's all circumstantial. They fire him? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=284.11999999999995s)]
*  He moved on. When Cullen left the hospital [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  the insulin overdoses stopped. At St. Barnabas they could have [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=291.28s)]
*  had my license investigated and probably revoked at that point in time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  Should they have? Should they have? Yes. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=299.64s)]
*  But instead of ending Charles Cullen's nursing career St. Barnabas marked the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=302.88s)]
*  beginning of a 16-year killing spree. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=307.32s)]
*  Cullen would work at eight other hospitals [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=310.0s)]
*  and be suspected of harming patients at six of them. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=313.2s)]
*  But those suspicions never reached subsequent employers [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=316.44s)]
*  and Cullen continued to murder patients with virtually impunity. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=320.4s)]
*  In 1993 prosecutors investigated Cullen for murdering 91-year-old Helen Dean [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=324.36s)]
*  An autopsy tested for nearly 100 medications [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=331.76s)]
*  but not the one Cullen used to kill her. A powerful drug called Digoxin [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=335.08s)]
*  or DIG for short. It was Cullen's first weapon of choice. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  Why did you like DIG? DIG [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=344.23999999999995s)]
*  was a very powerful cardiac medication. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=348.2s)]
*  What does it do to someone? In small amounts it slows the heart rate down. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=351.32s)]
*  In larger amounts it can cause what's called complete heart block [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  and then the heart is very irregular. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=362.32s)]
*  And you know it can cause death. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=366.8s)]
*  It does cause death in large amounts. It was also readily available in critical [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=370.12s)]
*  care units [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=375.04s)]
*  and Cullen figured out ways to conceal his Digoxin withdrawals from an [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=375.92s)]
*  automatic drug dispensary system [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=380.08s)]
*  called PIXIS which required nurses to type in the name of the patient [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=382.16s)]
*  and the drug to be administered. I wouldn't go in for Dig. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=386.36s)]
*  I would go in under Tylenol or [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=390.16s)]
*  another medication that would be in the same drawer. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=393.32s)]
*  So you know there was no record of me going in for Dig other than [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  the fact that you know it was in the same drawer. How did you choose who you were going to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  give this medication to? It's [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=406.92s)]
*  difficult for me to go back in time and think about what [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=410.24s)]
*  things were running through my mind at the time. Was it personal? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=414.2s)]
*  No. Did you get pleasure out of it? Satisfaction? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=417.24s)]
*  No, I mean I thought that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=421.4s)]
*  that people weren't suffering anymore so in a sense [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=425.35999999999996s)]
*  I thought I was helping. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=429.68s)]
*  Cullen suggested several times that his actions were merciful [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=433.68s)]
*  but the evidence doesn't support it. 60-year-old [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=437.79999999999995s)]
*  Eleanor Stecker, an asthma patient, was recovering and in no pain [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=441.12s)]
*  when Cullen administered a fatal digoxin overdose. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=445.32s)]
*  College student Michael Stranko, who suffered from an autoimmune disease, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=448.44s)]
*  was recovering from what his parents called routine surgery to remove his [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=453.28s)]
*  spleen. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=457.71999999999997s)]
*  My heart, it aches for my son. It bleeds for my son. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=458.44s)]
*  We vividly remember Charles Cullen [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=463.96s)]
*  walking into the waiting room. He looked us right in the eye [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=467.24s)]
*  and stated how Michael was gravely ill and people don't make it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=471.16s)]
*  And my wife told Cullen, that's enough. You could leave now. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=475.04s)]
*  We're haunted by the memory of Charles Cullen coming to the waiting room [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=479.2s)]
*  to get our reaction. There were people that you caused to die who were not near [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=483.6s)]
*  death [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=488.72s)]
*  and not suffering that much. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=489.16s)]
*  You know, again, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=497.52s)]
*  you know, I mean, Michael [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=500.56s)]
*  here isn't to justify, you know, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=504.2s)]
*  what I did. There is no justification. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=507.4s)]
*  I just think that [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=511.6s)]
*  the only thing I can say is that I felt overwhelmed at the time. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=516.64s)]
*  Can you give us anything? Can you give the families anything? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=521.0s)]
*  Any explanation for [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=524.88s)]
*  how this happened and why this happened? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  Like I said, I can't. I just can say that [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=532.6s)]
*  it was more or less, you know, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=537.4s)]
*  felt like I needed to do something. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=540.84s)]
*  And I did. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  That's not an answer to anything. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=548.72s)]
*  Charles Cullen was the youngest of eight children and grew up poor on this street [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=553.24s)]
*  in West Orange, New Jersey, protected by his mother. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=557.72s)]
*  Cullen was 17 when she died. He tried to kill himself. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=560.76s)]
*  He spent six years in the Navy, most of them as a missile technician on a [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=564.92s)]
*  nuclear submarine. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=569.8s)]
*  He was miserable, felt bullied, tried to kill himself again. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=571.08s)]
*  After receiving a general discharge, he decided to take up nursing. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=575.12s)]
*  He got married and started a family, but it all went sour. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=580.44s)]
*  A messy divorce, custody battles, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=583.88s)]
*  bankruptcy, heavy drinking, more half-hearted suicide attempts, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  and trips to the psychiatric ward. That was Charles Cullen's state of mind when [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=591.52s)]
*  he was killing people [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=596.76s)]
*  and on the night he finally confessed to the murders. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=597.88s)]
*  I tried to kill myself [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=600.96s)]
*  throughout my life [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=604.84s)]
*  because I never really liked being who I was. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=609.16s)]
*  I didn't think I was worthy of anything. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=613.48s)]
*  It was never about anyone but Charlie Cullen. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=617.64s)]
*  He did what he did [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  because of his own needs, his own compulsions. Author Charles Graeber [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=624.52s)]
*  interviewed Cullen more than a dozen times for his book, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=628.48s)]
*  and he remembers seeing words like paranoid, major depression, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=631.64s)]
*  hostile, passive aggressive, and antisocial [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=635.4399999999999s)]
*  on psychiatric reports. He sees himself as a victim, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=638.6800000000001s)]
*  and as a victim he's entitled to lash out [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  in any way he wants to [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=646.2s)]
*  make things right. If that means killing patients, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=649.44s)]
*  anything justifies his victimhood. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=653.24s)]
*  You said at one point that you thought it was about power and control. What do you mean? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=657.0400000000001s)]
*  If the rest of his life was spinning out of control, if he was [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=663.1600000000001s)]
*  losing custody, if he was [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=666.6s)]
*  feeling depressed, if his love life was in the toilet, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=669.48s)]
*  he could poison patients, he could save patients, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=673.36s)]
*  he could make decisions. He had an arena in which he mattered [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=677.12s)]
*  and where his actions had [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=680.92s)]
*  definite consequence. Here you have a person who tried to kill himself [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=684.4399999999999s)]
*  at least 20 times, who was in and out of [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=689.48s)]
*  psych wards, and on some occasions [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=693.1600000000001s)]
*  walked right out of the psych ward and right into a job as a [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=696.64s)]
*  critical care nurse. Right, he actually took a call asking him [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  back on shift from a psych ward. Why wouldn't the hospitals do some background checks? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=703.64s)]
*  Well, partially because they weren't required to, and partially because [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=709.08s)]
*  there was a nursing shortage on. Charlie Cullen looked good. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=713.0400000000001s)]
*  By the end of his career he was a 16-year veteran. He had recommendations, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=716.36s)]
*  and for a hospital to [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=719.96s)]
*  ask too much or say too much became a liability. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=722.9200000000001s)]
*  You can't penalize a nurse for seeking counseling, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=726.36s)]
*  for seeking treatment, for going to a rehab center successfully. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=729.44s)]
*  And so because of that Charlie hid in those shadows. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=733.72s)]
*  When Cullen was hired at St. Luke's University Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=737.76s)]
*  he'd been fired or forced to resign from five other hospitals. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=743.0s)]
*  Yet none of this was in his file with the state nursing board. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=747.6400000000001s)]
*  By his own count, Cullen had already murdered 11 people, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=750.88s)]
*  and he would kill at least five more at St. Luke's. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=755.4000000000001s)]
*  Nurses were suspicious, there were rumors about his past, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=758.72s)]
*  and Cullen was caught red-handed stealing lethal drugs. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=762.6800000000001s)]
*  But instead of calling the police, St. Luke's brought in a lawyer [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=766.4000000000001s)]
*  to confront Cullen. Do you think that they knew what you were doing at St. Luke's? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=770.44s)]
*  I think that they had a strong suspicion. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=774.64s)]
*  Did you expect to get caught? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=776.92s)]
*  Well, I think you can say I was caught at St. Barnabas and I was caught at St. Luke's. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=780.04s)]
*  There's no reason that I should have been a practicing nurse after that. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=787.8s)]
*  They offered you some kind of a deal? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=790.76s)]
*  They said if you resign, we'll give you neutral references. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=792.8s)]
*  And I decided to go with that. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=797.52s)]
*  What is it about this system and about hospitals that no one went to the police, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=800.44s)]
*  no one really wanted to find out what was going on? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=807.96s)]
*  They gave you an opportunity to leave. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=812.08s)]
*  I think because it's a matter of worrying about lawsuits, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=814.2s)]
*  if they pointed out that there was a problem, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=819.6s)]
*  we're going to be found liable for millions of dollars. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=822.16s)]
*  So I guess they just saw it as a lot easier to not put themselves in a position of getting sued. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=824.96s)]
*  After Charles Cullen was escorted out the door of St. Luke's Hospital with no consequences, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=833.12s)]
*  one of the nurses called a friend at the Pennsylvania State Police with their suspicions, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=838.44s)]
*  and an investigation was begun. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=842.96s)]
*  By then, Cullen had already found another job at the Somerset Medical Center in New Jersey. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=845.2s)]
*  He would murder another 13 people there, but it would be his final stop. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=850.48s)]
*  That story when we come back. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=854.96s)]
*  In September 2002, when Charles Cullen was hired as a critical care nurse [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=864.0s)]
*  at New Jersey's Somerset Medical Center, the hospital knew nothing about his dark past. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=869.12s)]
*  It didn't know that he'd been fired or forced to resign at a half a dozen hospitals, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=874.24s)]
*  or that he'd been investigated by authorities for harming patients. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=878.68s)]
*  And there was no reason to suspect that Cullen had murdered five patients at his last job. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  He was able to move from hospital to hospital without so much as a bad reference. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=887.72s)]
*  Cullen would kill another 13 people at Somerset in 13 months and try and kill three more, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=892.6s)]
*  before two detectives, a state bureaucrat, and a female nurse finally connected the dots. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=898.4399999999999s)]
*  You're under suspicion at St. Luke's. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=905.6s)]
*  Yet you went off to Somerset and kept doing exactly the same things. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=908.64s)]
*  And it looks like, to me, that you wanted to get caught. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=915.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=920.6s)]
*  You don't know? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=922.04s)]
*  Because, you know, you're right. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=923.96s)]
*  I mean, I continued. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=927.16s)]
*  But I was also... [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=928.76s)]
*  I was also careful. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=931.36s)]
*  I was also denied at any time anybody would have asked me. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=932.56s)]
*  It was the suspicious death of a Roman Catholic priest named Florian Gull [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=937.64s)]
*  that set in motion the events that would eventually expose Charles Cullen. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=942.0400000000001s)]
*  Reverend Gull had died unexpectedly overnight while recovering from pneumonia, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=946.44s)]
*  and the hospital discovered high levels of the heart drug, Dijoxin, in his blood. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=950.9200000000001s)]
*  It was the second unexplained overdose in two weeks. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=955.76s)]
*  The blood levels were astronomical. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=959.64s)]
*  They're way higher than you would ever shoot for by using the drug therapeutically. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=961.92s)]
*  Dr. Stephen Marcus is the director of New Jersey's Poison Control Center. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=968.84s)]
*  He heard about the Dijoxin overdoses when a pharmacist at Somerset [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=973.48s)]
*  called his office asking for help with some dosage calculations. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=977.52s)]
*  The pharmacist also confided that two more patients in the same unit [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=981.72s)]
*  had turned up with abnormally high levels of insulin. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=986.08s)]
*  What's going through your mind? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=989.32s)]
*  My number one, two and three thought was that there was something malicious [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=990.52s)]
*  going on in the institution. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=994.36s)]
*  In July of 2003, Marcus set up an urgent conference call [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=996.36s)]
*  with the hospital's medical director, Dr. William Coors, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1000.64s)]
*  and taped the conversation in which he told the hospital to notify the authorities. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1004.16s)]
*  This is a police matter. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1009.36s)]
*  What we're wrestling with is throwing the whole institution into chaos [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1010.72s)]
*  versus responsibility to protect patients from further harm. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1015.64s)]
*  And we have been trying to investigate this to get some more information [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1021.24s)]
*  before we made any kind of rush to judgment. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1027.48s)]
*  If there is somebody out there that is purposely doing this to individuals [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1031.32s)]
*  at your hospital, we have a legal obligation to report this. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1036.96s)]
*  OK. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1041.84s)]
*  Somerset Medical Center would eventually notify authorities, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1043.24s)]
*  but it would take them three long months. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1046.56s)]
*  Do you know how many patients died between those five? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1049.68s)]
*  No, I don't know the number, but I do know that there were some patients [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1053.28s)]

*  Five? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1058.1200000000001s)]
*  That we know of. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1061.0800000000002s)]
*  But those five deaths, I'll remember them the rest of my life. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1063.28s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1068.76s)]
*  They didn't have to happen. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1071.84s)]
*  They should have been preventable, yes. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1073.44s)]
*  It was October before Somerset County Detectives Tim Braun and Daniel Baldwin [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1077.48s)]
*  finally met with hospital officials. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1082.12s)]
*  They were told about a half a dozen incidents in the critical care unit. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1084.56s)]
*  No one used the word homicide. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1088.56s)]
*  They had dropped a couple names on us with regards to their own internal [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1091.12s)]
*  investigation that they claimed to have conducted for several months. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1095.04s)]
*  And they did provide us two names in particular, but did not identify them [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1099.8s)]
*  as any type of suspect or anything like that. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1105.64s)]
*  One of them was Charles Cullen? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1109.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1111.44s)]
*  The detectives ran a routine background check on Charles Cullen [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1113.28s)]
*  and discovered that he'd been arrested for stalking a female nurse [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1117.2s)]
*  and breaking into her apartment in Eastern Pennsylvania. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1120.92s)]
*  The file there also contained a posted note saying that the Pennsylvania State [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1124.48s)]
*  Police had called just a few weeks earlier asking similar questions. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1129.24s)]
*  Detective Baldwin called the trooper who made the inquiry and hit pay dirt. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1134.24s)]
*  After speaking with the trooper, he informed me that his agency had conducted [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1138.88s)]
*  an investigation on Mr. Cullen with a suspicion that he was [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1143.48s)]
*  murdering patients in Pennsylvania as well. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1148.76s)]
*  He was using dejection to murder patients. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1151.28s)]
*  And you found this out with making two phone calls? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1154.08s)]
*  Yes, basically. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1157.0s)]
*  That was it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1158.16s)]
*  Did you think you had your man? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1158.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1160.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1160.72s)]
*  But the detectives knew that proving it would be difficult. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1161.76s)]
*  A number of law enforcement agencies had tried and failed. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1164.88s)]
*  How helpful was the hospital in this investigation? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1168.92s)]
*  How helpful was the hospital? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1174.0s)]
*  They were very helpful by answering court-issued subpoenas. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1176.04s)]
*  That was the extent of their cooperation. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1180.3600000000001s)]
*  When the detectives asked to see computerized records from the automated [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1183.8000000000002s)]
*  drug dispensary in the critical care unit, they say the hospital told them [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1187.56s)]
*  that it wasn't possible because the drug dispensing machine only stored [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1191.96s)]
*  records for 30 days. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1196.1599999999999s)]
*  They learned otherwise from the machine's manufacturer. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1198.08s)]
*  They lied to you? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1201.56s)]
*  Yes, they did. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1203.96s)]
*  They didn't want to give you records that turned out to be crucial to your [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1205.6399999999999s)]
*  investigation? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1208.72s)]
*  Yes, that's correct. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1210.3999999999999s)]
*  You think they tried to obstruct your investigation? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1212.76s)]
*  They didn't try to help it. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1216.32s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1217.32s)]
*  When the detectives informed Somerset that Charles Cullen was the target of their [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1219.2s)]
*  investigation, the hospital fired him, not for harming patients, for lying on his job [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1223.28s)]
*  application. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1228.6799999999998s)]
*  Did you get the sense at Somerset, for example, that any of your colleagues, any of the [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1230.12s)]
*  nurses, any of the doctors knew what was going on? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1234.72s)]
*  No. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1238.12s)]
*  Until the day I was fired, nobody gave me any indication that anybody was suspicious. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1239.12s)]
*  The weird thing about Somerset Hospital was that they were planning on firing me the night [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1250.9199999999998s)]
*  before, so they let me work one more shift, knowing that they were going to fire me the [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1255.0s)]
*  next day. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1259.4799999999998s)]
*  They let me work an additional shift with the suspicion that I had harmed patients, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1260.4799999999998s)]
*  which I, you know, it's kind of a bizarre thing to do. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1265.9599999999998s)]
*  Did you harm anybody that night? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1269.4399999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1271.04s)]
*  With Cullen gone and the medical center uncooperative, detectives Braun and Baldwin decided they [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1272.04s)]
*  needed an ally inside the hospital to help them gather evidence to make their case. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1277.32s)]
*  They decided to approach Amy Ridgeway, a critical care nurse who worked with Cullen on the night [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1282.8999999999999s)]
*  shift and was his best friend at the hospital. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1287.9199999999998s)]
*  He was always early, always on time, crisp and sat down and was very serious about getting [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1291.28s)]
*  to work. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1297.8s)]
*  Did you consider him to be a good nurse? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1298.8s)]
*  I did. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1301.08s)]
*  When the detectives first interviewed Ridgeway, she was hostile and upset that Cullen had [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1302.8s)]
*  been fired, so they decided to show her the evidence that they had gathered, the Pixis [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1307.36s)]
*  record showing Cullen's drug withdrawals from the dispensary and his real employment history. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1312.74s)]
*  What did you tell her? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1318.8s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1319.8s)]
*  She told her that he was released from several facilities. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1321.32s)]
*  There were allegations about him at other facilities for doing similar things that were [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1323.56s)]
*  going on at Somerset Medical Center. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1327.68s)]
*  I guess at that point she realized this couldn't be a coincidence. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1329.72s)]
*  And she offered to help? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1333.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1335.32s)]
*  Danny pushed this piece of paper across the table to me and it was the Pixis printouts. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1336.32s)]
*  I was devastated. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1349.0400000000002s)]
*  I knew. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1352.0400000000002s)]
*  I knew he was murdering people. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1353.0400000000002s)]
*  How did you know that? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1354.8000000000002s)]
*  There were so many withdrawals of lethal medications. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1357.3600000000001s)]
*  There's no reason, no reason except if you want to kill someone. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1364.2800000000002s)]
*  Were you angry? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1369.88s)]
*  I was sad for my patients. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1371.4s)]
*  So many things were going through my mind. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1375.5200000000002s)]
*  I was sad. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1377.24s)]
*  I didn't see it. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1379.0s)]
*  I felt betrayed by my own intuition. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1381.6s)]
*  Amy Ridgeway, who later persuaded Cullen to do the interview with us, spent days analyzing [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1384.8s)]
*  medical records for the detectives and schooled them on a computerized record system that [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1390.52s)]
*  would help reconstruct Cullen's activities on specific days. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1395.88s)]
*  She recorded phone conversations with Cullen and wore a wire at a meeting in this restaurant [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1400.4s)]
*  the same day a newspaper article reported that he was being investigated for killing patients. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1405.9199999999998s)]
*  I said, I know you're guilty. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1411.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1414.52s)]
*  I know you did this. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1416.6s)]
*  And yet I'm still here. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1419.04s)]
*  I'll take you down to the station. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1422.72s)]
*  We'll go together. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1424.6399999999999s)]
*  And he changed. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1427.1599999999999s)]
*  His face just changed. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1429.12s)]
*  And what did he say? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1433.0s)]
*  He said, I want to go down fighting. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1434.52s)]
*  I want to go down fighting. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1439.3600000000001s)]
*  Cullen told us he suspected that the police were listening in. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1442.0s)]
*  I knew that Amy had helped the police. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1445.28s)]
*  I strongly suspected that she was wired when she was asking me those questions. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1449.16s)]
*  So that didn't stop me having the same opinion of Amy, which is that she's a good nurse, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1456.1200000000001s)]
*  and that she's a caring nurse, and that she did it because she felt it was the right thing to do. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1464.36s)]
*  He was arrested right after that meeting on what police now admit was mostly circumstantial [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1469.04s)]
*  evidence. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1474.12s)]
*  What they needed was a confession, but Cullen refused to say anything. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1475.12s)]
*  So once again, the police turned to Amy Ridgeway for help. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1479.8s)]
*  What did you say to get him to confess? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1483.32s)]
*  I wasn't very honest with him. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1486.52s)]
*  And there's a part of me. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1491.76s)]
*  I still feel guilty about that. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1493.88s)]
*  I was manipulating him a bit. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1495.44s)]
*  I told him the investigators were also looking at me. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1498.68s)]
*  And how could he think that I wasn't somehow going to be implicated? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1507.8400000000001s)]
*  I remember saying to him, so who was your first victim? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1512.8400000000001s)]
*  Was it a long time ago? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1524.16s)]
*  Was it recent? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1525.92s)]
*  And he started to talk. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1529.36s)]
*  He said it was a long time ago. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1530.82s)]
*  I believe it was with a medication to drop the blood pressure. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1532.44s)]
*  Cullen's formal confession with the detectives would last seven hours. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1536.6s)]
*  We'll never know how many people Charlie Cullen killed. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1541.68s)]
*  Charles Graber spent seven years investigating the case for his book, The Good Nurse. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1544.2s)]
*  It's very difficult going back. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1549.28s)]
*  There's no paperwork. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1551.1200000000001s)]

*  He was working over 16 years. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1553.84s)]
*  In St. Barnabas alone, he later told investigators he was ghosting three to four people a week. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1556.36s)]
*  He didn't always know their outcomes. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1561.9599999999998s)]
*  How many do you think? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1563.4799999999998s)]
*  I would be very surprised, as would pretty much everyone I've spoken to with any knowledge [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1565.52s)]
*  of this case, if it was not in the hundreds, multiple hundreds. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1570.4799999999998s)]
*  You've been in here a while. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1577.12s)]
*  Nine years. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1579.2399999999998s)]
*  You knew it was wrong. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1580.84s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1581.84s)]
*  At the time? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1582.84s)]
*  At the time and later. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1583.84s)]
*  Are you sorry what you did? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1584.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1589.84s)]
*  But like I said, I don't know if I would have stopped. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1590.84s)]
*  Tonight, you're going to hear about the man the FBI is now calling the most prolific serial [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1601.84s)]
*  killer in the history of the United States. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1610.52s)]
*  His name is Samuel Little, and over the last year and a half, he has confessed to 93 murders. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1613.56s)]
*  That's more than were committed by Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer combined. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1619.8s)]
*  No one would have known the scale of Little's crimes if not for a Texas Ranger who had a [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1624.44s)]
*  hunch. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1629.04s)]
*  Little had never confessed to anyone about anything, but over the course of 700 hours [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1630.32s)]
*  interviews, Ranger James Holland coaxed the 79-year-old into revealing his life's work. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1635.82s)]
*  The confessions have enabled investigators across the country to solve dozens of cold [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1641.86s)]
*  cases, but Holland needs help to match up the rest. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1646.5s)]
*  It's why the Texas Ranger is telling us the story of how he got America's deadliest serial [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1650.44s)]
*  killer to confess. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1655.62s)]
*  With a swagger that would make John Wayne envious, Texas Ranger James Holland arrived [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1659.54s)]
*  this summer at the California State Prison. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1664.94s)]
*  He was escorted to the interview room for another round with Samuel Little, the killer [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1668.76s)]
*  who went undetected for nearly half a century. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1674.14s)]
*  Don't be fooled by his grandfatherly appearance. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1678.8600000000001s)]
*  I got away with numerous murders of women in my life over a span of 50 years. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1681.78s)]
*  93 murders in 19 states from 1970 to 2005. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1692.54s)]
*  Now near the end of his own life and out of appeals, Little has been spilling his secrets [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1698.78s)]
*  to Ranger Holland over the course of several interviews since May of last year. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1703.98s)]
*  Where did you kill the most? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1709.22s)]
*  Oh, that's easy. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1710.22s)]
*  Florida and California. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1711.22s)]
*  What city did you kill the most in? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1712.22s)]
*  Miami and Los Angeles. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1713.22s)]
*  How many did you kill in Los Angeles? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1714.22s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1715.22s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1716.22s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1717.22s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1718.22s)]

*  Los Angeles. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1721.22s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1722.9s)]
*  Los Angeles, approximately 20. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1723.9s)]
*  So how did he get by so long? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1724.9s)]
*  He was so good at what he did. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1728.66s)]
*  You know, how did you get away with this, Sammy? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1729.8600000000001s)]
*  Did the crime? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1732.24s)]
*  What's the problem? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1733.24s)]
*  The drifter from Ohio preyed upon the fringes of society. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1734.58s)]
*  Prostitutes, drug addicts. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1738.58s)]
*  Women he believed the police wouldn't work too hard to find. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1740.94s)]
*  The ranger says Little was a cunning killer who sized up his victims and his surroundings. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1744.3s)]
*  The first thing I picked up on is how wicked smart he was. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1750.24s)]
*  The guy is like genius. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1753.44s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1755.44s)]
*  Well number one, you know, the photographic memory, his memory for details. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1757.1200000000001s)]
*  We were like, tell me what's around her. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1760.48s)]
*  There's three tombstones over there. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1763.44s)]
*  There's a Caliche Road drive down a quarter mile. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1765.28s)]
*  There's a white Baptist church that needs to be whitewashed. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1767.64s)]
*  Phenomenal. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1770.84s)]
*  For example, Little remembered unusual arches close to the spot where he killed a woman [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1772.2s)]
*  outside of Miami. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1777.6s)]
*  Fair enough, when Miami detectives investigated, they saw the arches. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1779.64s)]
*  Little had strangled Merriam Chapman near those arches in 1976. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1784.48s)]
*  You've never felt like he sent you on some wild goose chase? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1790.1200000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1793.48s)]
*  Nothing he's ever said has been proven to be wrong or false. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1794.48s)]
*  We've been able to prove up almost everything he said. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1797.88s)]
*  Mr. Little. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1800.8400000000001s)]
*  Because of Little's confessions, judges and prosecutors nationwide have been able to close [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1802.2800000000002s)]
*  longstanding cases. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1807.52s)]
*  What is your plea to the charge of murder? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1809.68s)]
*  Guilty. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1812.48s)]
*  Here was Little via a video link from his prison in August, pleading guilty to two stranglings [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1813.56s)]
*  in Cincinnati. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1819.24s)]
*  In just over a year, 50 cold cases that had been dormant for decades have been solved [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1821.12s)]
*  due to the detailed confessions Little provided to the ranger. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1827.54s)]
*  Tell me about North Little Rock. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1831.92s)]
*  Tell me what that girl looked like. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1834.52s)]
*  She had a gap between her teeth. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1836.52s)]
*  Little grows disturbingly animated as he describes how he strangled his victims. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1841.52s)]
*  You know, she's fighting for her life, and I'm fighting for my pleasure. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1846.2s)]
*  So how do you reach a serial killer? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1851.52s)]
*  How do you get them to talk? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1853.72s)]
*  You avoid the things that normally work for investigators. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1854.96s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1857.84s)]
*  You avoid things like remorse and enclosure for the family. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1859.4s)]
*  Because they don't have remorse and they don't care about closure. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1864.8s)]
*  No, no, it doesn't appeal to them at all. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1867.0s)]
*  I mean, you're asking them to open up their soul to the things that are more intimate [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1869.3200000000002s)]
*  to them than anything in life. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1875.52s)]
*  Why should they do that with you? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1877.56s)]
*  And that's what you're working for. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1879.44s)]
*  This skinny black girl, real friendly. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1881.48s)]
*  She was laughing while I was killing her. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1885.48s)]
*  With Sammy, there's indications of visualization of when he's thinking about a crime scene. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1890.48s)]
*  He'll start stroking his face, and as he's starting to picture a victim, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1897.48s)]
*  you'll see him look out and up. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1901.48s)]
*  And you can tell he has this revolving carousel of victims, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1905.48s)]
*  and it's just spinning and he's waiting for it to stop at the one that he wants to talk about. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1909.48s)]
*  Investigators had discovered that Little liked to sketch. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1914.48s)]
*  Ranger Holland gave him art supplies, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1917.48s)]
*  wondering if he might be able to use his remarkable memory to draw his victims. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1919.48s)]
*  And he has. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1925.48s)]
*  Wow, these are all of his drawings. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1927.48s)]
*  These are all his. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1929.48s)]
*  They're pretty detailed. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1930.48s)]
*  Is there one that you looked at and you knew right away, oh, that's... [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1932.48s)]
*  There's a lot of them. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1935.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1936.48s)]
*  Yeah, as soon as we matched it up. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1937.48s)]
*  How many has he sketched? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1938.48s)]
*  There's some around 50. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1939.48s)]
*  The note on this one's super creepy. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1941.48s)]
*  Sam killed me, but I love him. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1943.48s)]
*  He writes notes in some of the drawings. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1945.48s)]
*  Tall girl by the highway. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1948.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1949.48s)]
*  Girl in a strip joint. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1950.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1951.48s)]
*  Left in the woods. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1952.48s)]
*  1972? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1953.48s)]
*  Right, yes. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1954.48s)]
*  And we've matched that one up. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1955.48s)]
*  You have? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1956.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a New Orleans murder. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1957.48s)]
*  I can't remember the person who checked me out of the hotel this morning. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1958.48s)]
*  If someone gave me a million dollars to draw her face, I couldn't do it. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1961.48s)]
*  The fact that he can still do this. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1964.48s)]
*  Right, he basically takes a photograph in his mind of exactly what he sees as he leaves them. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1966.48s)]
*  A year and a half ago, Ranger Holland had never heard of Samuel Little. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1972.48s)]
*  Little was rotting away in this prison at the edge of California's Mojave Desert, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1977.48s)]
*  sentenced to three life terms in 2014 for strangling three women. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1982.48s)]
*  In court, prosecutors had labeled Little a sexual predator. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1987.48s)]
*  He denied everything and was defiant to the end. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1991.48s)]
*  But the FBI noted that Little had somehow skirted charges for violent crimes year after year, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=1995.48s)]
*  in state after state, in places where women disappeared, including Texas. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2001.48s)]
*  That drew the interest of Ranger James Holland, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2007.48s)]
*  a skilled interviewer who says he's convinced dozens of killers to confess during his career. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2010.48s)]
*  Typically when people want you involved in a case, they want you there because why? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2016.48s)]
*  Virtually every single case that I ever deal with, there's no DNA evidence. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2020.48s)]
*  There's no forensics. There's no nothing. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2024.48s)]
*  And there was nothing linking Samuel Little to additional murders, just suspicions. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2027.48s)]
*  The Ranger was intrigued by a cold case in Odessa, Texas. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2032.48s)]
*  Denise Brothers was a prostitute working on the wrong side of town. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2037.48s)]
*  Then she went missing in 1994. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2041.48s)]
*  We looked everywhere. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2044.48s)]
*  Her son Damien remembers driving around Odessa with his grandparents looking for her. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2045.48s)]
*  A month later, Denise Brothers' body was found at the back of an abandoned parking lot dumped in brush. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2051.48s)]
*  We're asked to come down and look at the body. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2058.48s)]
*  You had to do that? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2060.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2061.48s)]
*  How old were you? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2062.48s)]
*  14. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2063.48s)]
*  That sticks with you. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2065.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2066.48s)]
*  For 24 years, Damien didn't know who killed his mother or why. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2068.48s)]
*  Ranger Holland learned Denise Brothers had been strangled and that Samuel Little was in West Texas at the time. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2074.48s)]
*  Did Sammy do it? I don't know, but I felt like there was a reasonable probability that he did it. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2081.48s)]
*  To find out if his instinct was right, the Ranger went to California last year to interview Little, who had always been hostile to law enforcement. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2089.48s)]
*  Did I believe he was going to confess? Complete arrogance on my part, absolutely. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2098.48s)]
*  And for the first couple minutes, it really was going quite poorly. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2105.48s)]
*  Oh, horrible. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2109.48s)]
*  He's raging. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2110.48s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2111.48s)]
*  Little vented in the interview room for 30 minutes that he had been wrongly depicted as a rapist. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2112.48s)]
*  There was no doubt in my mind that Samuel Little was not a rapist. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2118.48s)]
*  But I told him he knew it and I knew it, that he was a killer. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2122.48s)]
*  And he stops and he kind of looks at me for a second. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2126.48s)]
*  He didn't seem to mind it. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2131.48s)]
*  And then you could see in his eyes as he's looking away and he follows back as I say the word killer. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2132.48s)]
*  And that appealed to him. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2137.48s)]
*  That's how he defines himself. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2138.48s)]
*  As a killer. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2141.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2142.48s)]
*  Was there a moment where you said, I've got him? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2143.48s)]
*  Yeah, when he talked about there may be three victims in Texas. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2145.48s)]
*  Three victims and one of them was in Odessa, Texas. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2149.48s)]
*  All of a sudden we turned to each other. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2153.48s)]
*  Oh, my gosh, he's talking about Odessa. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2155.48s)]
*  And we grab our files and start going through and checking what he's talking about and verifying. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2157.48s)]
*  Christy Palazzolo of the FBI and Angela Williamson of the Department of Justice analyze violent crimes. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2162.48s)]
*  They were listening to the interview across the hall and had access to the FBI database and the Denise Brothers file. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2169.48s)]
*  You've got the photos of the crime scene in front of you. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2176.48s)]
*  Did it match up right away? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2179.48s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2180.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2181.48s)]
*  And they had details. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2182.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2183.48s)]
*  That hadn't been reported. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2184.48s)]
*  Like what? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2185.48s)]
*  In Denise's case, you remember that she wore a denture. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2186.48s)]
*  The autopsy confirmed brothers did wear a denture. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2188.48s)]
*  All the details matched. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2192.48s)]
*  Samuel Little had killed Denise Brothers. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2194.48s)]
*  Ranger Holland knew he was on to something big. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2197.48s)]
*  He schemed to have Little extradited to Texas for a few months so he could talk to him around the clock and extract more confessions. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2201.48s)]
*  I would think Texas with the death penalty is the last place a killer like Stanley Little wants to go. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2209.48s)]
*  You know, basically what I told him was I can go to the district attorney and I can ask him to take the death penalty off the table. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2214.48s)]
*  And I believe that he will do that. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2220.48s)]
*  Which was especially brazen since Ranger Holland had never met the district attorney in Odessa, Bobby Bland. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2223.48s)]
*  And he said, I'd like a letter from you on your letterhead saying that you would waive the death penalty. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2230.48s)]
*  And I said, well, you know, that's a pretty tall order just to do blindly. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2237.48s)]
*  So why? Why did you do it? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2242.48s)]
*  There's a greater good. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2243.48s)]
*  The strange Ranger that was calling me from California telling me he had a serial killer. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2245.48s)]
*  I put my faith in him. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2250.48s)]
*  The next morning, the letter waiving the death penalty was in Samuel Little's hands. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2252.48s)]
*  Last September, the Ranger sent a plane to Whisk Little to Texas where he was housed in the Wise County Jail. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2257.48s)]
*  For 48 straight days, for hours on end, the two men sat in a small room. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2264.48s)]
*  During that time, Little confessed to 65 of his murders. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2269.48s)]
*  The Ranger applied Little with pizza and Dr. Pepper to keep the stories flowing. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2274.48s)]
*  People will hear this and go, why were you treating a serial killer so well? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2280.48s)]
*  What do I say to that? I say that we can have one case or we can have 93 cases. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2285.48s)]
*  It was in your best interest for him to be comfortable. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2291.48s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. Yes. Yes. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2293.48s)]
*  So why you? Why did he finally confess to you? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2295.48s)]
*  At the end of the day, maybe Samuel just liked me. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2299.48s)]
*  Today, Little is back at the California State Prison. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2305.48s)]
*  We wanted to interview him on camera, but state law won't allow it. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2309.48s)]
*  So we asked him to call us. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2314.48s)]
*  He did, answering our questions for nearly an hour. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2317.48s)]
*  We wondered why he decided to confess now. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2321.48s)]
*  Are you worried that there might be innocent people in jail for some of your crimes? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2324.48s)]
*  There will probably be numerous people who have been convicted and sent to the intervention on my behalf. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2329.48s)]
*  I say if I can help get somebody out of jail, God might smile a little bit more on me. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2335.48s)]
*  For most of our call, Little spoke of his victims. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2342.48s)]
*  They were broke and homeless, and they walked right into my fightaway office. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2346.48s)]
*  It was uncomfortable to listen to his graphic stories. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2351.48s)]
*  Towards the end of the interview, we asked him to reflect on the depths of his crimes. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2355.48s)]
*  I don't think there was another person that did what I'd like them to do. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2360.48s)]
*  I think they're the only one in the world. And that's not an honor. That is a curse. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2364.48s)]
*  With Little's old age, failing health and a fear that his memory could slip, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2370.48s)]
*  there is urgency to figure out who and where the rest of his victims are. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2376.48s)]
*  It's kind of like never ending. You have to continue. You have to finish it. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2381.48s)]
*  Ranger Holland's been encouraging Little to keep drawing. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2386.48s)]
*  Three new sketches arrived at the Rangers office just last week. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2390.48s)]
*  Three new faces last seen in the mind of the most prolific serial killer in American history. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xMTTmZpSM&t=2394.48s)]
