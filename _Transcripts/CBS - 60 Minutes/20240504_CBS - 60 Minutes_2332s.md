*  Just a couple of shavings of black truffles from France, known as black diamonds, can [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=0.0s)]
*  cost hundreds of dollars in a restaurant in Paris. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=18.26s)]
*  White truffles from Italy can cost more than three times as much. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=22.1s)]
*  Truffles are a fancy, delicious delicacy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=27.1s)]
*  Some say an aphrodisiac, an ounce for ounce the most expensive food in the world. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=29.82s)]
*  If you go to France and Italy, as we did, you learn quickly that truffles are under [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=35.78s)]
*  siege because they're becoming scarce. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=40.24s)]
*  They're being trafficked like drugs, stolen by thugs, and threatened by inferior imports [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=43.38s)]
*  from China. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=49.78s)]
*  He found one already? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=51.900000000000006s)]
*  Where? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  Where? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=54.260000000000005s)]
*  Where? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=55.260000000000005s)]
*  You found one? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=56.26s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=57.26s)]
*  Oh, smell that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=58.26s)]
*  In the beautiful Italian province of Perugia, truffle hunters roam the frosty hills with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=62.14s)]
*  their trained dogs who sniff out these lumpy mushrooms when they're ripe one at a time [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=67.74s)]
*  as they have for centuries. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=73.86s)]
*  Truffles grow wild underground, usually at the base of an oak tree. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=77.14s)]
*  They used to use pigs, but they ate the truffles. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=82.34s)]
*  Very rich American people, they only see truffles on the table of a very elegant restaurant. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=88.74s)]
*  They don't see this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  Now you know why they are expensive, right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  Olga Urbani may be the only person in the world who goes truffle hunting in a full-length [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=99.14s)]
*  fur coat and a Caribbean tan, but in the truffle business, she can pretty much do what she [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=104.1s)]
*  wants. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=109.94s)]
*  Olga. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=110.94s)]
*  Her company, Urbani, controls 70 percent of the world's truffle trade. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=112.58s)]
*  When you find the truffles, it's like to have a miracle. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=117.58s)]
*  Another one. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=121.98s)]
*  Other countries, including the U.S., have tried cultivating truffles with only limited [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=122.98s)]
*  success. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=128.14s)]
*  Oh, another one. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=129.14s)]
*  It's the combination of European red soil and rainy summers that produce an especially [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=130.38s)]
*  rich, earthy flavor. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=135.98s)]
*  At what price these truffles command make hunters act like they're mining for gold. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=138.89999999999998s)]
*  So this is $1,000. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=143.89999999999998s)]
*  Just right there is $1,000. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=146.89999999999998s)]
*  And it's why the hunters value their dogs more than just about anything. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  He said, I really love my wife but the dog. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=153.89999999999998s)]
*  These truffles will go right to the Urbani factory, where they're washed, sorted, and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=161.89999999999998s)]
*  either frozen or canned or flown fresh to fancy restaurants like New York's DB Bistro [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=167.1s)]
*  Moderne, home of the $150 hamburger smothered with truffles. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=173.62s)]
*  A few shavings on pasta can run you even more. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=180.62s)]
*  At an auction in Macau in 2010, this two-pound white truffle sold for $330,000, a record [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=184.54000000000002s)]
*  amount. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=192.9s)]
*  It's not like agriculture. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=193.9s)]
*  Truffles don't put a seed in the ground. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=195.62s)]
*  And they're a fungus. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=198.26s)]
*  They're underground fungus. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=200.3s)]
*  The farmer really can't make it happen. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=202.3s)]
*  No. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=204.9s)]
*  They can't do anything. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=205.9s)]
*  We can't do anything. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  You're always on the phone, many telephones saying, sorry, sorry, I don't have, I don't [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=209.38s)]
*  have. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=214.62s)]
*  And I wish I had 100 tons a day to make everybody happy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=215.62s)]
*  In France, the truffle is so revered that in the village of Ouzes, a special mass is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=222.74s)]
*  held in its honor. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=228.46s)]
*  Churchgoers not only put money in the collection plate, they also add truffles. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  There's a reason for the special prayers. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=235.78s)]
*  Because of climate change, the harvests are down from an annual haul of 2,000 tons of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=238.44s)]
*  truffles 100 years ago to just 30 tons today. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=243.82s)]
*  The scarcity and high prices have attracted elements of organized crime who've turned [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=248.94s)]
*  the truffle trade into something resembling the drug trade. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=254.2s)]
*  The reality is, behind the popularity of the truffle lies a dangerous world. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=257.86s)]
*  One of Europe's most famous truffle connoisseurs is the larger-than-life French chef and restaurateur [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=267.86s)]
*  known simply as Bruno. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=274.3s)]
*  Is it like the mafia? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=276.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=279.42s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=280.42s)]
*  It's good, a good name. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=281.42s)]
*  Well explain. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=282.42s)]
*  It's very difficult explique, because it's very dangerous for me. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=283.42s)]
*  At Bruno's restaurant in the heart of Provence, wealthy Europeans helicopter in from Paris [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=290.1s)]
*  and Monaco just to eat lunch. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  Bruno goes through about five tons of truffles a year, which his chefs shave on everything [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=299.3s)]
*  from potatoes to this amazing lobster dish. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=304.86s)]
*  But Bruno says the growing black market has led to people coming to his place not just [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=308.98s)]
*  to eat truffles, but to steal them. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=313.86s)]
*  The robbers came and got your truffles? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=316.86s)]
*  Yes, they stole 200 kilos of truffles. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=319.1s)]
*  200 kilos from you? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=321.98s)]
*  They didn't steal my money, they stole my truffles. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=323.98s)]
*  Some of the stolen truffles, we were told, are brought to markets like this one, in Richelange, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=327.3s)]
*  where middlemen sell out of the backs of cars or trucks. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=332.94s)]
*  But large quantities change hands in back alleys. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=337.34s)]
*  We witnessed this transaction, where the buyers and sellers wanted their identities hidden. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=341.06s)]
*  In less than a minute, 50 pounds of truffles were exchanged for 30,000 euros, about 40,000 [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  dollars, with no questions asked about where the truffles came from. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=353.38s)]
*  There's a problem of confidentiality and secrecy, and that encourages a mafia-like attitude. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=361.22s)]
*  Michel Tourne, a third-generation truffle farmer, says that local trufflers have been [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=367.34000000000003s)]
*  carjacked, beaten with baseball bats, and even killed. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=372.70000000000005s)]
*  Thieves came and stole his truffles, his trees, and worse, his dogs. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=377.94000000000005s)]
*  When they took your dogs, what did you do? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  I looked for them all over Europe. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=387.94000000000005s)]
*  I found a world I didn't know about. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=390.14s)]
*  It's a world that's rotten to the core. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=393.5s)]
*  Did you find your dogs? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=395.7s)]
*  Never. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=397.58s)]
*  But it's not criminals or climate change that worry the trufflers the most. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=399.06s)]
*  It's China. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=404.38s)]
*  For years, Chinese farmers used truffles as feed for their pigs. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=405.94s)]
*  That was until a businessman supposedly said, the hell with the pigs, let's feed the French. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=410.65999999999997s)]
*  Even if the taste of a Chinese truffle leaves something to be desired. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=417.22s)]
*  Let's talk about the Chinese truffle. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=421.26s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=423.46s)]
*  Catastrophic. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=424.46s)]
*  Catastrophic? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=425.46s)]
*  The Chinese truffle is worthless. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=426.46s)]
*  No perfume. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=432.38s)]
*  You couldn't smell it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=433.38s)]
*  No perfume. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=434.38s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=435.38s)]
*  No taste? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=436.38s)]
*  No. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=437.38s)]
*  If I went to China and took it out of the ground, it still wouldn't taste as good. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=438.38s)]
*  No, it's like eating wood. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=443.26s)]
*  She says that's because of the way truffles in China are farmed. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=446.02s)]
*  Unlike in France, where dogs smell when a truffle is ripe, the Chinese rake at the earth [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=450.62s)]
*  with no dogs, as a CBS News producer in China discovered, and harvest the truffles the minute [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=457.5s)]
*  they find them, which explains why, while the two truffles look the same, the price [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=464.14s)]
*  is drastically different. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=469.88s)]
*  The prices of winter truffles is about $1,000 a pound. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=472.62s)]
*  A pound of Chinese maybe $20, $30. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=477.14000000000004s)]
*  There are many people, bad people, who mix them. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=481.5s)]
*  So maybe they put a 30% of Chinese, 70% of... [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=485.5s)]
*  And I think you won't see it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=490.90000000000003s)]
*  On the day we were at the Urbani factory, sorters found a number of Chinese truffles [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=493.42s)]
*  mixed in with that day's purchases. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=498.62s)]
*  They were separated out into specially marked red baskets. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=501.86s)]
*  More and more Chinese truffles are slipped in with the good French or Italian strains. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=506.42s)]
*  Experts say it's like cutting flour into cocaine. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=512.14s)]
*  But look, your own farmers around here, or your own middlemen, are putting the Chinese [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=515.9s)]
*  in with your truffles. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=521.42s)]
*  You're telling us you have to be on guard, not from the Chinese, but from your own people. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=522.74s)]
*  And then you're selling them. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=528.1800000000001s)]
*  I know. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=530.02s)]
*  Food importers and middlemen are bringing 28 tons of Chinese truffles into France a [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=531.74s)]
*  year. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=537.38s)]
*  And many are being passed off as the real thing in some French restaurants. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=538.82s)]
*  Michel Tourneu says he's brought home some slices from his dinners out and studied them [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=543.58s)]
*  under a microscope in his lab at home to check their origin. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=549.34s)]
*  It does look different. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=553.1s)]
*  Tourneu has tried to blow the whistle on the restaurants that sell Chinese truffles at [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=554.34s)]
*  French prices. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=558.98s)]
*  But the police have more important matters on their plate and rarely do anything about [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=560.7s)]
*  it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=565.86s)]
*  Twenty-eight tons of Chinese truffles come into France every year. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=566.86s)]
*  Where do they go? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=572.86s)]
*  I think I know where they go, but I'm not going to tell you. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=575.5s)]
*  If you tell me you're in trouble, is what you're saying, they'll hurt you. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=578.9s)]
*  Everybody's in danger in this business. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=583.58s)]
*  So we began to look for Chinese truffles ourselves. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=587.7s)]
*  We found this product that is exported to the U.S. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=591.5s)]
*  On the front of the can, it says Black Winter Truffles, product of France, while on the [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=595.26s)]
*  back in small print, it says Tuber Indicum, the Latin name for Chinese truffles. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=600.9000000000001s)]
*  When we showed one of the cans to the Urbanis at a kitchen at their headquarters, it seemed [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=614.76s)]
*  to ruin their lunch. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=619.6s)]
*  This makes us crazy. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=621.56s)]
*  This destroys all the tradition of the truffle. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=622.9399999999999s)]
*  It's an entire life that goes in the garbage. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=627.1s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=631.6s)]
*  American law doesn't require a distinction between varieties of truffles, and this product [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=632.6s)]
*  does sell for considerably less than the best of France. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=638.68s)]
*  But American consumers are being deceived into thinking they're getting the finest [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=643.0s)]
*  quality at a bargain price. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=647.32s)]
*  The owner of this brand is Pierre-Jean Pepe. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=649.86s)]
*  This is your company, right? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=653.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=655.6s)]
*  Okay, so we found this in the United States. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=656.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=659.36s)]
*  Okay, so this says Black Winter Truffles. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=660.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=663.72s)]
*  But it's Chinese. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=664.72s)]
*  It's Chinese, yes. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=665.72s)]
*  This is the tin. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=666.72s)]
*  It's a French product. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=667.72s)]
*  The truffles, if I make the tin in China, it's a Chinese truffle. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=668.72s)]
*  I'm stunned. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=678.48s)]
*  He was saying that since the truffles are packaged here, he can legally write Product [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=679.7s)]
*  of France on the label. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=685.0600000000001s)]
*  It feels like I'm being tricked into thinking I'm buying French truffles, you know? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=686.64s)]
*  Yes, I understand. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=692.88s)]
*  And there's another problem. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=694.16s)]
*  Spores from the Chinese truffles are infecting the European soil and taking it over the way [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=695.8399999999999s)]
*  the kudzu weed has taken over parts of our own Southeast. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=701.52s)]
*  It began to happen in Italy, so the Italians made importing Chinese truffles illegal, and [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=705.88s)]
*  there's a move in France to do the same. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=711.76s)]
*  They are putting into danger the crown jewel of French gastronomy. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=715.4s)]
*  If one day by accident our plantation starts producing Chinese truffles, we are dead. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=721.44s)]
*  The great fear for Michel Tourneil and the other trufflers in France is that the Chinese [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  will do to their precious delicacy what they have done to Louis Vuitton bags, produce a [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=734.74s)]
*  knockoff that looks the same but is of lower quality. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=740.7600000000001s)]
*  And in this case, it could just put them out of business. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=745.3s)]
*  She's one of the most beloved cooks in the country, Ina Garten, known as the Barefoot [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=759.74s)]
*  Contessa. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=764.54s)]
*  Her cookbooks have sold more than 7 million copies. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=765.6999999999999s)]
*  Her weekly television show has run for two decades, earned seven Emmys, three James Beard [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=768.8199999999999s)]
*  Awards, and millions of devoted fans who tune in as much for the cooking lesson as [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=774.22s)]
*  the cocktail party that typically follows. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=779.0600000000001s)]
*  So we were surprised to see that Ina Garten isn't quite as freewheeling as you might think. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=782.0600000000001s)]
*  As remarkable as her culinary chops may be, Ina Garten's success hinges on hard work, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=787.14s)]
*  shrewd business sense, and leaving nothing to chance. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=792.94s)]
*  This is just a great weeknight meal. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=797.26s)]
*  It's so easy to do. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=799.82s)]
*  You do the first stage, have yourself a glass of wine. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=800.82s)]
*  Do the second stage and dinner's ready. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=804.1s)]
*  Whether she's whipping up one of her signature chicken dishes, slinging cosmos for her real-life [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=807.0600000000001s)]
*  friends or scooping ice cream, Ina Garten is a calming presence in the kitchen, taking [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=812.02s)]
*  the mystery out of cooking. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=818.0s)]
*  How easy is that? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=820.66s)]
*  She's built a culinary empire by making it all look effortless. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=822.0600000000001s)]
*  I know people don't believe this, but I'm really a nervous cook and I'm sure every recipe [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=826.38s)]
*  is going to turn out wrong. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=830.7s)]
*  So I'm incredibly precise. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=832.18s)]
*  Even now? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=834.22s)]
*  Even now. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=835.22s)]
*  I'm there with a cookbook going, is it a half a teaspoon or a whole teaspoon? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=836.22s)]
*  Are you really? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=839.1s)]
*  I follow my own recipes exactly because I've spent so much time getting the balance of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=840.1s)]
*  flavors and textures and everything right. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=845.34s)]
*  I'm really not a confident cook. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=847.3s)]
*  I would think that you were like, you know, swigging wine and tossing an herb. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=849.26s)]
*  Let's keep that image going. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=855.26s)]
*  So this is my commute to work. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=856.66s)]
*  Awful for you. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=860.5s)]
*  At 74, the image of Ina Garten with her denim shirt, chic scarves and signature bob is [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=861.86s)]
*  as reliable as the tried and true recipes she's built her reputation on. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=868.22s)]
*  Those recipes are a roadmap for home cooks from a home cook. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=873.34s)]
*  People like Bobby Flay have worked in restaurants, kitchens all his life, and he can just throw [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=878.22s)]
*  things together. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=883.06s)]
*  I've watched him. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=884.06s)]
*  He's such a brilliant cook. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=885.06s)]
*  I'm not that person. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=886.06s)]
*  I didn't have that experience. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=887.06s)]
*  When you say you're testing and testing yourself at first, how many times do you have to make [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=889.02s)]
*  something before you get away? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=893.74s)]
*  Sometimes 10 times, sometimes 25 times. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=895.62s)]
*  And then I'll print out a page and give it to one of my assistants and watch them make [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=898.38s)]
*  it. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=903.18s)]
*  And it so surprises me what people do. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=904.62s)]
*  I was making lentil salad, warm French lentils, and she was putting in garlic in it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=908.74s)]
*  I said, what are you doing? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=914.3s)]
*  And she said, well, it said cloves. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=915.46s)]
*  Cloves of garlic in it. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=917.94s)]
*  And I was like, no, it's cloves, not cloves of garlic. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=919.0600000000001s)]
*  And I thought, I never would have made that mistake, but somebody else at home is going [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=922.7s)]
*  to make that mistake. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=926.0200000000001s)]
*  So I just want you to feel like I'm right there beside you, just kind of guiding you [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=927.0200000000001s)]
*  through the recipe. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=931.1800000000001s)]
*  So this is the secret garden. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=933.0600000000001s)]
*  Don't tell anybody about it. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=935.0200000000001s)]
*  Garden has been guiding viewers from her home in East Hampton, New York for 20 years. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=937.5400000000001s)]
*  I love these tomatoes. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=942.62s)]
*  Do you really do the gardening? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=944.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, I point. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=946.18s)]
*  So yes. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=948.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=949.38s)]
*  It may seem like she grew out of the rich Long Island soil. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=950.38s)]
*  She did not. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=953.9799999999999s)]
*  Born in Brooklyn, New York, Ina Rosenberg grew up in Stamford, Connecticut. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=955.4599999999999s)]
*  Her dad was a doctor, her mom, a dietician. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=960.2199999999999s)]
*  As a teenager, she was instructed to stay out of the kitchen and excel in school. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=963.38s)]
*  She did both. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=968.0999999999999s)]
*  She met her future husband, Jeffrey Garden, while she was 16 years old. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=969.42s)]
*  And four years later, they were married. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=973.66s)]
*  Jeffrey, a lieutenant in the 82nd Airborne, later took her backpacking through France. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=975.78s)]
*  She came home with an ambitious mission. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=981.7s)]
*  So I got Julia Childs Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and I just worked my way through [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=984.66s)]
*  those books, which were very complicated recipes. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=989.02s)]
*  I mean, they were ingredients in each recipe that was another recipe in itself. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=992.74s)]
*  And I loved that challenge. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=997.22s)]
*  You never went to cooking school? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=998.5s)]
*  Never went to cooking school. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=999.9s)]
*  Was Julia Childs book your cooking school? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1001.26s)]
*  Julia Child was my cooking school. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1003.86s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1005.5s)]
*  Her actual degree was in economics. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1007.42s)]
*  At 26, she had a job at the White House analyzing nuclear energy policy for the Ford administration. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1010.06s)]
*  Jeffrey worked around the corner at the State Department. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1016.98s)]
*  Each weekend, Ina says they devote their time to less bureaucratic pursuits, like making [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1020.42s)]
*  a great dinner party look simple. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1025.66s)]
*  To this day, I follow this. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1028.2s)]
*  I never made something for a dinner party. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1029.42s)]
*  I had made several times. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1031.1s)]
*  So on Monday, I would make the roast leg of lamb with tomatoes with duxelles, which are [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1033.1s)]
*  mince, finely minced mushrooms, for Jeffrey for dinner. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1039.1799999999998s)]
*  Lucky man. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1043.02s)]
*  And then I'd make it again on Wednesday. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1044.02s)]
*  And then by Saturday, I knew how to make it. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1046.4199999999998s)]
*  And the poor guy would go, oh, this is delicious. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1048.34s)]
*  What is this? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1050.6399999999999s)]
*  After a thousand dinner parties and two administrations at 30 years old, Ina had burned out of life [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1052.6799999999998s)]
*  inside the Beltway. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1058.74s)]
*  In 1978, she saw this ad in the back of the New York Times for a 400-square-foot specialty [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1060.42s)]
*  food store in West Hampton, New York, called the Barefoot Contessa. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1066.62s)]
*  But you had never been to the Hamptons. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1071.02s)]
*  You didn't know anything about running a store. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1073.26s)]
*  I knew how to make 12 brownies for my friends, but I certainly didn't know how to make 100 [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1076.18s)]
*  brownies. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1079.94s)]
*  I didn't even know how to cash out the register or slice smoked salmon. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1080.94s)]
*  To me, brie was like a foreign language. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1084.74s)]
*  So was it confidence that allowed you to do that, or was it that you were being naive? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1087.14s)]
*  I have a very low threshold of boredom. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1092.0200000000002s)]
*  And I was really bored with my job. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1095.14s)]
*  And I just thought, this is really exciting. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1097.6200000000001s)]
*  This is what I do for fun. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1099.74s)]
*  And now I can do it professionally. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1102.42s)]
*  And so I just thought, I'm just going to jump in, thinking, well, how hard could this be? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1104.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1109.3000000000002s)]
*  It was really hard. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1111.14s)]
*  The gardens say they double-mortgaged their house. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1112.8200000000002s)]
*  Ina told us she was working 20 hours a day to keep up with the crowds who came to gawk [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1115.66s)]
*  at the goods and load up on lobster salad. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1119.94s)]
*  Soon, she opened a bigger shop in East Hampton. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1122.9s)]
*  It's very deliberate. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1126.38s)]
*  I was always doing research. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1127.42s)]
*  It looks like I was just having a good time wandering around having a party. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1129.8600000000001s)]
*  But it was all careful and deliberate. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1133.46s)]
*  A calculating businesswoman, Ina Garden elevated the food scene and soon had Finicky Hampton's [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1136.46s)]
*  clientele falling over themselves to have the Barefoot Contessa cater their weddings [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1142.5s)]
*  or Thanksgiving. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1147.82s)]
*  And every year, we would pack up the orders Wednesday night so people could come in Thursday [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1149.54s)]
*  morning and I would use the van next to the store as a refrigerator. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1154.58s)]
*  And one year, it was like 33 degrees when I was going home and I thought, nobody wants [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1160.3s)]
*  a frozen Thanksgiving dinner. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1164.74s)]
*  So I drove the van home and I set my alarm for every single hour all night to turn the [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1166.7s)]
*  heat on for a few minutes and then go back to sleep. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1174.22s)]
*  To keep the turkeys warm. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1177.3400000000001s)]
*  To keep the turkeys, well the turkeys we roasted in the morning, but like the vegetables and [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1178.3400000000001s)]
*  the sides and all that stuff. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1181.66s)]
*  After 18 years, Garden decided to sell the Barefoot Contessa in 1996. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1183.46s)]
*  So I mean one minute I'm making a thousand baguettes and the next minute I have nothing [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1188.74s)]
*  to do, I mean nothing to do. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1191.54s)]
*  How was that? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1193.3400000000001s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1194.3400000000001s)]
*  And I thought, you know, I'm 50. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1196.3s)]
*  Maybe that's the end of my career. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1198.3799999999999s)]
*  Hardly. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1199.98s)]
*  The lull lasted nine months before Garden started writing the Barefoot Contessa Cookbook, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1200.98s)]
*  the first of 13 cookbooks, nine of which became New York Times bestsellers, crushing big-name [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1206.02s)]
*  chefs by remembering the lessons learned at her specialty food shop. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1211.94s)]
*  I realized later what I knew was what people want to eat at home, which was roast chicken [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1216.26s)]
*  and roast carrots and chocolate cake and coconut cupcakes and things that I knew from the [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1220.8799999999999s)]
*  store people bought and took home. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1226.14s)]
*  You weren't trying to say here's everything I know. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1228.3400000000001s)]
*  You were saying here's what you need to know. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1230.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, here's what will make you happy at home. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1232.38s)]
*  Her latest cookbook, Go To Dinners, was inspired by the pandemic and again, Ina is in every [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1235.46s)]
*  detail. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1242.0600000000002s)]
*  One of the things about the book that is not by accident is that you can put it on the [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1243.0600000000002s)]
*  counter and it doesn't flop shut. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1248.26s)]
*  I'm so glad you noticed that. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1250.74s)]
*  Beyond, Garden sought out a printer in Japan so her cookbooks would lie flat. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1252.82s)]
*  It wouldn't close while cooking. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1257.1399999999999s)]
*  She designed them to have white space for notes and pictures as guides. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1259.54s)]
*  Simplicity is a non-negotiable. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1263.3s)]
*  Do you ever throw something out because it's too difficult to make? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1265.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1268.6599999999999s)]
*  If I get to a point in a recipe and I go I'm never going to make this recipe again, everything [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1269.6599999999999s)]
*  goes in the trash. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1273.34s)]
*  And if you're exhausted by the time you finish that, it's not good for the party. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1275.12s)]
*  So you're thinking about the party above all things. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1279.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm always thinking about the party. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1282.06s)]
*  The party got real big, real fast after Ina was invited to be on Martha Stewart's show. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1284.06s)]
*  An outtake caught the eye of a Food Network executive. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1289.94s)]
*  She said that I was making something and I took a spoonful of it and tasted it and go [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1293.52s)]
*  this is really good. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1297.34s)]
*  And Martha Stewart crew said cut. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1300.74s)]
*  You can't talk with your mouth full. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1302.8999999999999s)]
*  And I was like why? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1304.26s)]
*  It's a cooking show. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1305.44s)]
*  Martin told network executives she didn't want a show but eventually gave in with a [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1306.78s)]
*  caveat. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1311.1399999999999s)]
*  Instead of an adoring studio audience, she insisted on a more intimate affair in her [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1312.58s)]
*  kitchen. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1317.46s)]
*  She directed the cameras to come closer so it felt like a dinner party. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1318.8s)]
*  One of the things I'm fascinated by is that there are a lot of people who watch your show [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1323.72s)]
*  who don't cook. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1327.74s)]
*  What do you think the appeal is? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1328.74s)]
*  Why are they watching you cook? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1330.8s)]
*  I think there was a time when mom was in the kitchen cooking for us and I think people [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1333.58s)]
*  feel like they're just hanging out with me and I'm cooking for them. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1338.3799999999999s)]
*  When you're cooking, it's not about look at me. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1341.18s)]
*  Oh, it's never about look at me. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1344.42s)]
*  I'm like don't look at me. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1346.26s)]
*  I'm just the opposite. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1348.3799999999999s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1351.58s)]
*  I have a friend who said everybody else is like look at me, look at me, pay attention [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1352.58s)]
*  to me. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1356.36s)]
*  And I'm like well this is what I do. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1357.36s)]
*  You can do whatever the f**k you want to do. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1361.38s)]
*  And I'm just having fun here. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1366.38s)]
*  The fun came to a screeching halt for Ina and everyone else during the pandemic. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1368.0400000000002s)]
*  Unable to film her show or cook for her friends, Garten turned to Instagram offering practical [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1373.3400000000001s)]
*  advice to home cooks. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1379.0600000000002s)]
*  It's really important to keep traditions alive. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1380.8200000000002s)]
*  And stirring up some fun. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1383.48s)]
*  You never know who's going to stop by. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1385.0200000000002s)]
*  Wait a minute, nobody's stopping by. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1386.94s)]
*  Two cups of vodka and more than three million views later. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1388.96s)]
*  Delicious. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1392.92s)]
*  With the lockdown over, we wanted to make sure Ina didn't have to drink alone. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1395.32s)]
*  If you do this, Jeffery arrives. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1399.56s)]
*  Hi sweetie. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1402.56s)]
*  You know Sharon, right? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1405.56s)]
*  I know Sharon. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1406.56s)]
*  Hi Sharon. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1407.56s)]
*  So we made a red grapefruit paloma for you. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1408.56s)]
*  How's that? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1410.24s)]
*  Mr. Garten had a successful career on Wall Street and served as the dean of Yale's business [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1411.24s)]
*  school. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1416.28s)]
*  Millions of viewers know him simply as Jeffery. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1417.32s)]
*  Ina has called you her muse before. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1420.52s)]
*  What is she to you? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1423.52s)]
*  Well she's the center of my life. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1425.0s)]
*  She's actually the font of enormous amount of fun. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1429.2s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1440.8s)]
*  That's not bad. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1441.8s)]
*  The couple's been married for more than 50 years. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1442.8s)]
*  Is this a typical day at the house? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1445.92s)]
*  Oh yeah, we have cocktails all the time. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1447.72s)]
*  A couple of times a day. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1449.6000000000001s)]
*  That's the secret to a happy marriage. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1452.3200000000002s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1453.96s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1455.96s)]
*  The next morning we went looking for carbs. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1456.96s)]
*  But in the Hamptons, the corner shop doesn't sell donuts. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1460.24s)]
*  This is Carissa's. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1464.0s)]
*  So cute. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1465.0s)]
*  Isn't it wonderful? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1466.0s)]
*  Garten took us to her favorite local bakery for a taste of the good life. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1467.0s)]
*  What is it that you love about this spot? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1471.4s)]
*  First I love Carissa's because it's two local women and the two of them have built this [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1474.12s)]
*  extraordinary place with great quality food. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1477.9199999999998s)]
*  They use local ingredients on almost everything. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1481.36s)]
*  And they're here every day and it just feels like what I used to do. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1484.32s)]
*  It feels like coming home. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1487.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh look how fabulous that is. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1488.9199999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1490.84s)]
*  That is sansi patan. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1491.84s)]
*  This is just what I would typically have for breakfast. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1492.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1494.9199999999998s)]
*  This is all lovely but the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich is like $20. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1495.9199999999998s)]
*  A lobster roll is $38. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1499.84s)]
*  First of all it's organic, it's local and things are expensive here. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1502.44s)]
*  But it's not just a piece of white bread. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1506.68s)]
*  It's a roll that Carissa made. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1509.16s)]
*  One of the luxuries of being here is that you can make a really good quality product. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1511.4s)]
*  Garten's life isn't all French pastries and rose-colored cocktails but we thought it's [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1515.96s)]
*  pretty dang close. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1520.52s)]
*  She may still be a nervous cook but Ina Garten has nailed the recipe for a good life. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1522.2s)]
*  I don't want to do what I love doing and I want to do it really well and then I want [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1528.24s)]

*  Joya sold French food, right? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1533.0800000000002s)]
*  Martha sold perfection. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1534.72s)]
*  You're slinging fun. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1536.4s)]
*  Well I just think if you're not having fun what's the point really. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1537.4s)]
*  Today when chefs can be as famous as movie stars and their creations in the kitchen as [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1542.6s)]

*  was born. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1584.0800000000002s)]
*  When we went to Modena to meet Chef Bottura we were struck by how operatic he is. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1585.74s)]
*  Imagine, imagine, imagine. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1593.3600000000001s)]
*  Dream, you have to dream about food. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1595.0s)]
*  Do you dream about food? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1597.8s)]
*  I always dream about food. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1599.96s)]

*  Yeah, just one bite. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1635.28s)]
*  And close your eyes, connect your mental palate and understand. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1638.04s)]

*  Complexity. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1653.96s)]
*  And that's his signature as a chef. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1655.24s)]
*  And what's he making? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1658.08s)]
*  He's making risotto, toasting rice with, look, orange juice. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1659.08s)]

*  Due persone, due menu super, non marcia! [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1670.08s)]

*  avant-garde masterpieces that he says are inspired by contemporary art. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1682.84s)]
*  His creations are like canvases and he christened them. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1688.48s)]
*  He calls this camouflage made of wild hair, juniper berries and cocoa powder. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1692.52s)]
*  Oh, that's spectacular. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1698.6s)]

*  What do you call this dish? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1735.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1738.04s)]
*  His culinary creations are rooted in the traditions of northern Italy and his hometown, Modena, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1740.48s)]

*  And that was it. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1872.64s)]
*  So the biggest provocation of all. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1873.64s)]
*  A tortellini is something... [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1875.2800000000002s)]
*  It's comfort food for Modenias. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1877.3200000000002s)]
*  It's like a religion. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1879.96s)]
*  You don't believe in God, you believe in tortellini, but you don't want six. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1880.96s)]
*  You want a nice big abundant bowl of tortellini with the hot broth. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1884.4s)]
*  And he was serving this sort of room temperature broth gel and the tortellini were there and [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1888.72s)]
*  there were six of them and the Modenias were like putting their hands like, what did I [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1895.4s)]
*  come here for? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1899.52s)]
*  Why am I here? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1900.52s)]
*  And you're laughing. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1901.52s)]
*  Food critics ask themselves the same question. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1902.64s)]
*  A very important Modenias food critic came and... [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1905.56s)]
*  The Modenias food critic. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1908.6000000000001s)]
*  A very Modenias food critic came and ate at our restaurant. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1909.84s)]
*  Of course the review was terrible. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1913.6799999999998s)]
*  The review was like, please don't go there. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1917.28s)]
*  Don't go there. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1921.84s)]
*  And hardly anyone did. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1923.4399999999998s)]
*  His food was seen as a sacrilege in a country that reveres mothers and their home cooking. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1925.6s)]
*  Did you ever say to yourself, okay, I'm going right back to the old Italian cooking. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1931.56s)]
*  I can do it. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1936.8799999999999s)]
*  I know how to do it. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1937.8799999999999s)]
*  Never. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1938.92s)]
*  No. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1939.92s)]
*  Now you can't do that. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1940.92s)]
*  But after six years of bad reviews and empty tables, he gave in and introduced a handful [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1941.92s)]
*  of traditional Italian dishes, including an old fashioned tagliatelle. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1948.5600000000002s)]
*  And then a prominent national food critic happened by, ordered the tagliatelle and wrote... [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1954.44s)]
*  But these are the best tagliatelle in the world. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1961.8000000000002s)]
*  He said that. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1963.8000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1964.8000000000002s)]
*  So that turned everything around? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1965.8000000000002s)]
*  Totally. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1968.8s)]
*  You are known as the maestro. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1969.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1972.24s)]
*  Now. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1973.24s)]
*  Before they want to crucify me in the main piazza. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1974.24s)]
*  Now they call me maestro. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1976.72s)]
*  That's the difference. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1978.08s)]
*  Some of the maestro's dishes are improvisations born out of accidents, like his, oops, I dropped [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1979.72s)]
*  the lemon tart. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1986.6399999999999s)]
*  That's a classic. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1989.12s)]
*  The story begins when his pastry chef, Taka, was making a lemon tart. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1992.0s)]
*  I saw Taka completely white. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=1998.1200000000001s)]
*  He dropped one of the two tart in the plate, upside down, just like that. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2000.08s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2005.76s)]
*  Taka was like, ready to kill himself. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2006.76s)]
*  And I said, Taka, Taka no, please no. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2010.3600000000001s)]
*  Don't kill yourself. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2014.64s)]
*  Don't, don't. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2015.64s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2016.64s)]
*  That lemon tart is so beautiful that we have to serve the second one exactly the first [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2017.64s)]
*  one. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2023.76s)]
*  We did it. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2024.76s)]
*  We built in a perfect way the imperfection. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2025.76s)]
*  We smashed the other tart exactly as the first one. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2030.52s)]
*  I can't believe we did that. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2034.96s)]
*  If I think now, I was like, we were crazy. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2037.48s)]
*  I was like totally out of mind. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2040.16s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2042.6s)]
*  Oops, I dropped the lemon tart. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2043.6s)]
*  Is Jackson Pollock on a plate? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2045.64s)]
*  And it's one of the most popular dishes on a tasting menu of 12 courses that with wine [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2048.52s)]
*  can cost more than $500 a person. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2054.4s)]
*  They serve lunch and dinner five days a week, and it's always booked. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2057.6000000000004s)]
*  Reservations open three months in advance and fill up in minutes. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2062.44s)]
*  Are you prepared for the best salad of your life? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2068.52s)]
*  He invited us to sample some of his other signature dishes in his well-stocked wine [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2073.32s)]
*  cellar. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2078.32s)]
*  Caesar salad in bloom. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2079.32s)]
*  Those are flowers? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2081.28s)]
*  All flowers. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2082.28s)]
*  Edible flowers. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2083.28s)]
*  All edible flowers. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2084.28s)]
*  Twenty-seven elements in that dish. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2085.28s)]
*  It takes two chefs to build a salad leaf by leaf, petal by petal. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2089.0800000000004s)]
*  And for this dish, it takes a splash of seawater. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2095.84s)]
*  This is seawater transformed into paper. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2099.6800000000003s)]
*  You make paper out of seawater? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2102.5600000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2104.7200000000003s)]
*  It may not look like it, but this is Boutoura's filet of sole topped off with wisps of dehydrated [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2105.7200000000003s)]
*  seawater. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2112.16s)]
*  He calls it Mediterranean combustion. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2113.72s)]
*  How am I ever going to eat normal food again? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2116.68s)]
*  Ever. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2119.88s)]
*  But you feel how light you feel? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2120.88s)]
*  Very light. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2122.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2123.8399999999997s)]
*  But totally delicious. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2124.8399999999997s)]
*  How long did it take you to create this one dish? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2125.8399999999997s)]
*  Was it months? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2129.4s)]
*  Thirty-two years. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2130.4s)]
*  Thirty-two years of experience. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2131.4s)]
*  Now 56, after all his hard work, Boutoura is riding high. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2134.2s)]
*  Sometimes on his customized Ducati motorcycle. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2140.2s)]
*  But a few years ago, he began to feel something was missing in his life. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2143.7599999999998s)]
*  That serving fancy food to international foodies wasn't enough. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2148.2s)]
*  So like other celebrity chefs, he began to think about helping the poor by feeding them. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2152.98s)]
*  This is late 2013. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2159.52s)]
*  We had just sort of one year into having our third Michelin star that we had worked 20 [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2161.6s)]
*  years to get. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2167.3999999999996s)]
*  And I'm thinking now you want to start doing this? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2169.04s)]
*  I thought it was a terrible idea. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2171.52s)]
*  But she relented and helped him open a number of what he calls refittorios, kind of souped [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2173.42s)]
*  up soup kitchens. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2179.64s)]
*  But he didn't want them to feel like down and out stand in line cafeterias. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2181.7599999999998s)]
*  So partnering with local charities, he created warm inviting dining rooms in old abandoned [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2186.86s)]
*  theaters or unused space in churches where the working poor and homeless Italians and [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2193.04s)]
*  refugees from Africa sit side by side with volunteers who serve them three course meals [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2199.4s)]
*  like in high quality restaurants. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2206.36s)]
*  The food donated by local grocery stores would have been thrown out because it's slightly [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2209.18s)]
*  damaged or near its sell by date. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2215.1s)]
*  We are Italian, so we're going to make pasta. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2218.98s)]
*  He's opened six refittorios so far in London, Paris, Rio de Janeiro and three in Italy with [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2221.6s)]
*  more to come. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2230.2799999999997s)]
*  Where did that inspiration come from? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2231.96s)]
*  The numbers are mad. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2234.22s)]
*  Numbers. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2238.68s)]
*  Thirty three percent of the world production are wasted every year. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2239.68s)]
*  1.3 billion tons of food is wasted every year. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2247.96s)]
*  Think about one trillion of apples goes in the garbage. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2253.12s)]
*  Think about how many apple pie you could create with those trillions of, you know, that's [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2260.76s)]
*  insane. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2270.36s)]
*  The man who has for decades insisted on the oldest balsamic, the finest parmesan, the [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2271.76s)]
*  freshest tomatoes, now realizes their salvation in discarded leftovers. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2278.0200000000004s)]
*  If cooked well, they can nourish the poor, as he says, by filling their stomachs and [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2284.5s)]
*  lifting their spirits. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2290.2400000000002s)]
*  And his as well. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2295.48s)]
*  It's absolutely necessary to give back some of the lucky life you are living. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2297.7s)]
*  So this is about giving back. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2303.7799999999997s)]
*  It's what we need. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2306.98s)]
*  We need dreams. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2309.3399999999997s)]
*  If you don't dream and you don't dream big, you know, you cannot change the world. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsEMMHKS4MI&t=2310.8599999999997s)]
