**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [March 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE)
*  The [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=0.0s)]
*  the [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2.9s)]
*  the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=5.9s)]
*  Verner Herzog may not be a household name, but he is one of the most respected and unusual filmmakers of our time. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=11.9s)]
*  Over the last six decades, the German director has made more than 70 documentaries and feature films [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=19.1s)]
*  about everything from an unhinged cop in New Orleans to a guy who thought he could live with grizzly bears. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=25.0s)]
*  He did until they ate him. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=30.5s)]
*  Verner Herzog has never shied away from the extreme. If anything, he's drawn to it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=33.0s)]
*  His movies are often dreamlike explorations of the power of nature, the frailties of man, and the edges of sanity. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=38.1s)]
*  At 82, he's still working constantly, still making movies no one else would or could ever dream of. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=45.900000000000006s)]
*  This was the film that introduced Verner Herzog to the world in 1972. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=55.9s)]
*  Aguirre, The Wrath of God, about a group of conquistadors searching for a lost city of gold in the Amazon [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=61.9s)]
*  and the wrath who gradually descend into madness. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=68.9s)]
*  The wrath of God. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=72.9s)]
*  Shot on a shoestring budget in Peru, it only got finished because of Herzog's force of will and determination. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=76.9s)]
*  I read that you sold your shoes in order to get some fish to feed the crew. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=84.9s)]
*  Well, it's not normally what a director has to do. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  It's good to have some good boots and you can barter it for a load of fish on my wristwatch. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  I would give away, I would give away everything. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  And it's worth it? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  Of course. Of course it's worth it. I get away with the loot. I have a film. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  That's the loot though. You're not talking about making millions and millions of dollars. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=110.8s)]
*  The loot for you is the film. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=114.7s)]
*  Yeah. And of course I make money sometimes and I invest it in the next film. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=116.7s)]
*  If you've seen any of Herzog's documentaries, it may be Grizzly Man, one of his most commercially successful. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=126.7s)]
*  It tells the strange tale of Timothy Treadwell, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=132.7s)]
*  Oh, hi, Grinch. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=135.7s)]
*  An eccentric drifter who spent 13 summers in the wilds of Alaska, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=137.6s)]
*  recording himself interacting with grizzly bears. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=141.6s)]
*  By show weakness, I may be hurt, I may be killed. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=144.6s)]
*  Treadwell seemed convinced he had a spiritual connection with the Grizzlies and was somehow their protector. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=147.6s)]
*  In the end, he's the one who needed protecting. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=153.6s)]
*  Go back and play. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=156.6s)]
*  We sat down with Herzog to watch the film and others at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=160.6s)]
*  and the David Geffen Theater in Los Angeles. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=166.5s)]
*  And what haunts me is that in all the faces of all the bears that Treadwell ever filmed, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=168.5s)]
*  I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=173.5s)]
*  You have a distinctly unromantic view of nature. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=178.5s)]
*  Yes. Nature is utterly indifferent. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=180.5s)]
*  We are not made to become brothers with the bears. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=183.5s)]
*  That happens in Walt Disney, not in real life. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=188.5s)]
*  Take a step to the left. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=193.5s)]
*  In all of Herzog's feature films and documentaries, you'll find remarkable moments, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=195.4s)]
*  nightmarish ones as well. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=200.4s)]
*  His curiosity has taken him to the remotest regions of our planet. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=205.4s)]
*  In celluloid we trust. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=209.4s)]
*  With his distinctly Teutonic tone, he narrates his documentaries himself [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=211.4s)]
*  and asks questions that rarely have easy answers. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=216.4s)]
*  Do fish have souls? Do fish have dreams? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=221.3s)]
*  Herzog has revealed hidden landscapes under the Antarctic ice sheet [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=228.3s)]
*  and apocalyptic oil fires in Kuwait after the first Gulf War. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=234.3s)]
*  Has life without fire become unbearable for them? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=241.3s)]
*  He's risked his life to capture the power of volcanoes. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=246.3s)]
*  And filmed ancient cave paintings in France rarely seen before. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=251.3s)]
*  Herzog is now working on a new documentary in Los Angeles with his editor Marco Capaldo. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=258.3s)]
*  It's a movie about the search for a legendary herd of elephants in Southern Africa. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=273.3s)]
*  But Herzog insists it's not a wildlife film. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=278.2s)]
*  It's a fantasy of elephants, maybe a search like for the white whale from Moby Dick. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=283.2s)]
*  It's a dream of an elephant. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=290.2s)]
*  Herzog never had any formal training as a director. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=293.2s)]
*  He was born in Munich just two weeks before the Allies bombed it in 1942. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=296.2s)]
*  His father was away serving in the German army when his mother fled with Werner [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=301.2s)]
*  and his older brother to the mountains of Bavaria. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=306.09999999999997s)]
*  We grew up in complete poverty and we had no running water, no sewage system, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  hardly ever electricity. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=314.09999999999997s)]
*  We had one loaf of bread per week and we were hanging it at her skirt wailing [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  that we were hungry and she spins around and she looks at us and she says, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  boys, if I could cut it out of my ribs, I would cut it out of my ribs but I can't. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=329.09999999999997s)]
*  To this day that experience shapes you? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=334.0s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=337.0s)]
*  Follow me! [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=339.0s)]
*  Herzog didn't see his first film until he was 11. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=341.0s)]
*  He got hooked on American B-movies like Zorro and decided filmmaking was his destiny. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=344.0s)]
*  He just needed a camera. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=350.0s)]
*  He finally found one in a film school in Munich. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=352.0s)]
*  One day I saw this camera room and nobody was in there and I took one and tested it, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=355.0s)]
*  it walked out and they never noticed that the camera was missing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=360.9s)]
*  I mean, that's a stolen camera. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=364.9s)]
*  It was more expropriation than theft. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=366.9s)]
*  You have to have a certain amount of, I say, good criminal energy. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=370.9s)]
*  To make a film. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=377.9s)]
*  Sometimes, yes, you have to. You have to go outside of what the norm is. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=379.9s)]
*  16, 4. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=385.79999999999995s)]
*  He's been going outside the norm his whole life. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  In 1979, he began working on a fever dream of a film called Fitzcarraldo. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=391.79999999999995s)]
*  It took him three grueling years to make. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  German actor Klaus Kinski plays an obsessed Irishman who'll stop at nothing to build an opera house in the Amazon. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=401.79999999999995s)]
*  I want my opera house! [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  Give it a go! [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  To raise the money for it, Fitzcarraldo hatches a plan to harvest lucrative rubber trees in a remote jungle [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=414.7s)]
*  and hires indigenous laborers to haul a ship over a mountain to do it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=421.7s)]
*  Herzog refused to cut corners. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=426.7s)]
*  He insisted on buying a 340-ton steam ship and actually moving it up a mountain. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=428.7s)]
*  Couldn't you have used special effects with a model of a ship being moved over a mountain [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=435.7s)]
*  rather than actually moving it in a dormitory? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=441.7s)]
*  Yes, that was a discussion with 20th Century Fox and they said we could shoot it in the Botanic Garden in San Diego [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  and we could move a tiny miniature boat and I said, no, we are not speaking the same language. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  It certainly would have been easier. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  No, it would have been a lousy film. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  That was the least of it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  A border war forced Herzog to move the production a thousand miles away to a new location. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  There were money problems, plane crashes, fighting between local indigenous groups and constant battles against the rain and mud. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=469.5s)]
*  Herzog's relentless pursuit of his vision took a toll on the cast and crew and on him as well. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=477.5s)]
*  Documentary filmmakers shot the chaos behind the scenes and turned it into a movie all its own called Burden of Dreams. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=484.5s)]
*  It's just been re-released in theaters. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=492.5s)]
*  We are challenging nature itself and it hits back. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=495.4s)]
*  It just hits back, that's all, and that's grandiose about it and we have to accept that it is much stronger than we are. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=499.4s)]
*  Of course there's a lot of misery that is all around us. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=507.4s)]
*  The trees here are in misery and the birds are in misery. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=512.4s)]
*  I don't think they sing, they just screech in pain. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=517.4s)]
*  Did you feel that every day? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=521.4s)]
*  Every day, every night, and the next day, and the next night and on. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=523.3s)]
*  Herzog also had to deal with Klaus Kinski, the star of the film who was prone to explosions of rage. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=534.3s)]
*  I had a mad man as a leading character. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=541.3s)]
*  He had a temper. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=545.3s)]
*  As demented as it gets, you had to contain him and I made his madness, his explosive destructiveness, productive for the screen. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  Every gray hair on my head I call Kinski. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=561.1999999999999s)]
*  Kinski appeared in five of Herzog's films and died in 1991, but not before putting his own thoughts about Herzog down on paper. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=566.1999999999999s)]
*  This is what Klaus Kinski said of you in his autobiography. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=575.1s)]
*  Yes, it's beautiful stuff. I actually helped him with a dictionary, with Roger's Thesaurus. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=592.1s)]
*  When Fitzcarraldo was finally released in 1982, Herzog won the Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=600.0s)]
*  You must have been deluded to make this, or crazy in some way. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=609.0s)]
*  No, no, no, but the fact is, when you look at the film industry, there's so much craziness around, so much illusion, so much dementia, so much ego. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=614.0s)]
*  And when I look at this, I know I'm the only one who is clinically sane. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=625.9s)]
*  This shows you're the only one who's sane? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=630.9s)]
*  It shows it, yes, yes. That's my proof. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=632.9s)]
*  Herzog still has the journals he wrote while making Fitzcarraldo. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=635.9s)]
*  Over the months, as the pressure on him grew, his writing became barely readable. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=640.9s)]
*  But it becomes microscopic almost. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=645.9s)]
*  He turned those journals into a book called The Conquest of the Useless. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=648.9s)]
*  He's published 11 others as well, fiction, poetry and memoirs. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=652.8s)]
*  I've always maintained since more than four decades that my writing, my prose and my poetry will outlive my films. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=657.8s)]
*  You think your writing will outlive your films? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=666.8s)]
*  Yes, I'm totally convinced of that. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=668.8s)]
*  Herzog doesn't just work behind the camera. Every now and then, he acts. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=671.8s)]
*  That's him in the Star Wars series The Mandalorian. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=676.8s)]
*  Please lower your blaster. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=679.8s)]
*  You would do well to remember that life is heartless. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=681.6999999999999s)]
*  He's also lent his distinctive voice to several characters on The Simpsons. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=684.6999999999999s)]
*  I'd say goodbye, but what's the point? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=687.6999999999999s)]
*  I have to know when I'm keeping away from them. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=694.6999999999999s)]
*  Last September, we joined Herzog as he taught aspiring filmmakers on the Spanish island of La Palma off the west coast of Africa. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=698.6999999999999s)]
*  It's covered in volcanic rock and ash from an eruption three years ago. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=705.6999999999999s)]
*  A Herzogian landscape if ever there was one. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=710.6s)]
*  You want to leave him and he looks in this direction. You just pan away. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=717.6s)]
*  It's an 11-day workshop. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=722.6s)]
*  Less about the fundamentals of filmmaking and more about poetic vision and grit. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=724.6s)]
*  It's his fantasies. It's his ghosts that he's searching. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=730.6s)]
*  He calls it a film school for rogues. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=734.6s)]
*  And for the rogues, I also say you are able-bodied, earned money to finance your first films, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=737.5s)]
*  but don't earn it with clerical works in an office. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=743.5s)]
*  Go out and work as a bouncer in a sex club. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=747.5s)]
*  Work as a warden in a lunatic asylum. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=750.5s)]
*  Go out to a cattle ranch and learn how to milk a cow. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=754.5s)]
*  Earn your money that way in real life. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=759.5s)]
*  You do not become a poet by being in a college. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=762.5s)]
*  And I teach them a few things like forging a shooting permit. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=766.4s)]
*  Can I have it? You see, it should look really authentic. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=771.4s)]
*  How to fake a shooting permit. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=774.4s)]
*  The shooting permit during a dictatorship. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=776.4s)]
*  Have you made those? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=778.4s)]
*  Yes, of course. And I teach lockpicking. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=780.4s)]
*  You have to know. Yes, you have to be good at that. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=782.4s)]
*  To make a film, you have to know how to forge a permit and pick a lock. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=786.4s)]
*  And you better carry bolt cutters everywhere. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=789.4s)]
*  It's not for the faint-hearted. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=792.4s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=795.3s)]
*  For nearly 70 years Sir David Attenborough has been exploring the planet, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=804.3s)]
*  taking hundreds of millions of television viewers [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=808.3s)]
*  on eye-opening journeys through the natural world. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=811.3s)]
*  Jungles and island archipelagos, deserts and deep under the sea. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=814.3s)]
*  No place has been too remote, no animal too elusive for Sir David [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=819.3s)]
*  David and his talented team of filmmakers to document. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=822.3s)]
*  The man known as a national treasure in his native Britain is 95 years old now, but age [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=826.62s)]
*  and the pandemic haven't slowed him down. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=832.2199999999999s)]
*  When we sat down with him last fall, he was about to come out with a new book and a stunning [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=834.62s)]
*  new Netflix film, A Life on Our Planet. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=839.14s)]
*  They are what he calls a witness statement, a first-hand account of what he has seen happen [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=842.74s)]
*  to the planet and a dire warning of what he believes awaits us if we don't act quickly [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=847.8s)]
*  to save it. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=853.3599999999999s)]
*  The living world is a unique and spectacular marvel. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=854.3599999999999s)]
*  In this film, Sir David Attenborough's voice is the same, sonorous and soulful, reassuringly [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=866.64s)]
*  familiar. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=872.7199999999999s)]
*  Dazzling in their variety and richness. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=873.7199999999999s)]
*  But his message is uncharacteristically alarming. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=877.52s)]
*  The way we humans live on Earth is sending it into a decline. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=881.28s)]
*  Human beings have overrun the world. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=887.9599999999999s)]
*  We're replacing the wild with the tame. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=892.16s)]
*  Our planet is headed for disaster. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=898.48s)]
*  You call the film a witness statement. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=904.0s)]
*  A witness statement is given when a crime has been committed. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=906.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, a crime has been committed. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=909.4s)]
*  And it so happens that I'm of such an age that I was able to see it beginning. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=913.0s)]
*  And I'm sorry, just that I enjoy saying doom, doom, doom. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=919.48s)]
*  On the contrary, I'm not sure I'll enjoy it. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=923.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm excited, thrilled, excitement, pleasure, joy, joy, joy, joy. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=926.52s)]
*  But if you've got any sense of responsibility, you can't do that. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=931.36s)]
*  Sir David spoke to us via Zoom near his home in London, where he'd been living in isolation [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=934.52s)]
*  due to the pandemic. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=939.72s)]
*  I imagine you living in a house full of things that you have collected from travels around [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=940.72s)]
*  the world, a sort of cabinet of curiosities. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=945.76s)]
*  Well, that is true in a sense. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=947.92s)]
*  And certainly I've got a cellar full of rock, lots of rocks. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=951.56s)]
*  And sometimes you pick it up and you say, good Lord, what on Earth is this? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=955.36s)]
*  Oh, indeed, why on Earth would I bother to pick this up? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=959.0s)]
*  He studied geology and zoology in college and was working as a producer at the BBC [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=963.44s)]
*  in 1954 when he convinced his bosses to let him loose and start traveling the world. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=968.0s)]
*  He was just 28 years old. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=974.36s)]
*  Wherever I went, there was wilderness, sparkling coastal seas, vast forests, immense grasslands. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=979.6s)]
*  You could fly for hours over the untouched wilderness. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=992.56s)]
*  It was the best time of my life. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=998.4399999999999s)]
*  David Attenborough became a household name in 1979 with his groundbreaking BBC series [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1002.28s)]
*  Life on Earth, which was seen by an estimated 500 million people worldwide. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1008.06s)]
*  I know it sounds like a publisher's slogan, but it is the greatest story ever told. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1013.8s)]
*  The story of how life developed on this planet and led to you and me sitting here talking [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1019.36s)]
*  across an ocean. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1025.0s)]
*  Viewers were drawn in by Attenborough's enthusiasm and sense of wonder. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1028.8s)]
*  This was his first film encounter with endangered mountain gorillas in Rwanda. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1033.74s)]
*  It was really very unfair that man should have chosen the gorilla to symbolize all that [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1037.76s)]
*  is aggressive and violent. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1045.44s)]
*  And that's the one thing that the gorilla is not and that we are. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1048.0400000000002s)]
*  I remember it very vividly. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1053.8400000000001s)]
*  They ended up, two of them, sitting on me. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1057.0400000000002s)]
*  Two of the babies sitting on me. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1059.2s)]
*  Was I alarmed? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1061.5600000000002s)]
*  Was I frightened? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1062.76s)]
*  Was I concerned that the mother of those two babies was going to turn on me? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1063.76s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1067.64s)]
*  Not for a microsecond. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1068.64s)]
*  It was the biggest compliment I can remember receiving. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1070.4s)]
*  You were being accepted into that family. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1073.0800000000002s)]
*  And it was unforgettable. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1075.88s)]
*  Unforgettable moments in the wild is what Sir David Attenborough has become known for. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1079.88s)]
*  Boo! [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1084.8000000000002s)]
*  There's barely a corner of the earth he hasn't been to or a species he hasn't shown us in [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1085.8000000000002s)]
*  a new way. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1091.0400000000002s)]
*  He's done more than just bring the natural world into our homes. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1097.2s)]
*  He's helped us make sense of it. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1102.2800000000002s)]
*  They are on parade. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1104.24s)]
*  Given it a story. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1107.88s)]
*  She's seen enough. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1111.32s)]
*  Full of characters and complexity. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1113.08s)]
*  Not to mention excitement. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1115.96s)]
*  Take a look at this from BBC's Planet Earth 2. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1118.68s)]
*  A snake's eyes aren't very good. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1121.76s)]
*  So if the hatchling keeps its nerve, it may just avoid detection. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1124.28s)]
*  I saw that on a plane and I started talking to the person next to me in my seat saying, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1128.68s)]
*  you have to watch this. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1137.88s)]
*  This is extraordinary. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1139.52s)]
*  They thought I was crazy. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1141.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's the job of a narrator for natural history films is a bit of a doddle. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1142.52s)]
*  A bit of a doddle? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1150.0800000000002s)]
*  A bit of a piece of cake. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1151.48s)]
*  It's really pretty easy because the animals are so fantastic. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1153.28s)]
*  Sir David has always been an animal advocate. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1158.88s)]
*  In the early 1960s, he was a founding member of the World Wildlife Fund. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1161.76s)]
*  But in his films, he rarely focused on the destruction of their habitat or climate change. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1166.28s)]
*  You were skeptical of climate change. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1173.36s)]
*  I think that's interesting because I think it makes your warnings now all the more powerful. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1175.68s)]
*  Yeah, certainly so. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1182.04s)]
*  And if you're going to make a statement about the world, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1184.2s)]
*  you better make sure this isn't just your own personal reaction. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1189.1200000000001s)]
*  And the only way you can do that is to see the work of scientists around the world [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1193.3600000000001s)]
*  who are taking observation as to what's happening. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1200.8000000000002s)]
*  That's what's happening to temperature, what's happening to humidity, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1203.0s)]
*  what's happening to radioactivity, what's happening ecologically. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1205.76s)]
*  You've said that climate change is the greatest threat facing the planet for thousands of years. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1209.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1214.36s)]
*  Even the biggest, the most awful things that humanity has done and so-called civilisations have done [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1215.12s)]
*  pale to significance when you think of what could be around the corner [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1221.0s)]
*  unless we put ourselves together. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1225.12s)]
*  Deserts in Africa have been spreading. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1227.6399999999999s)]
*  There could be whole areas of the world where people can no longer safely live. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1230.4399999999998s)]
*  The hottest temperatures yet recorded in Death Valley and yet we are such optimists [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1236.24s)]
*  that we say we go to bed and I say, oh well, that was exceptional. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1242.8s)]
*  Gosh, that was interesting, wasn't it? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1245.2s)]
*  That was the highest temperature. Good Lord. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1246.72s)]
*  So that's the end of that. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1249.24s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1250.64s)]
*  Wait, wait another few months, wait another year. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1252.1200000000001s)]
*  See you again. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1255.64s)]
*  Over the years, Sir David has repeatedly visited Australia's Great Barrier Reef. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1257.3600000000001s)]
*  Now, Coral Reef is one of the most dramatic and beautiful and complex manifestations of life [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1262.56s)]
*  you can find anywhere. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1269.12s)]
*  But on his last trip, he was stunned by what he saw. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1270.84s)]
*  And we went on this week, which I knew, and it was like a cemetery [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1274.52s)]
*  because all the corals had died. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1278.32s)]
*  They died because of a rise in temperature and acidity. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1281.12s)]
*  There are still people who are going to see this and say, well look, it's not that bad and... [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1284.52s)]
*  Who are these people who are saying this? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1289.96s)]
*  Do you think technology will evolve to come up with some sort of a solution that we can't even imagine? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1291.16s)]
*  No. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1297.6000000000001s)]
*  We live in a finite world. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1299.0s)]
*  Ultimately, we depend upon the natural world for every mouthful of food that we eat [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1301.5600000000002s)]
*  and indeed every lungful of air that we breathe. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1308.72s)]
*  I mean, if it wasn't for the natural world, the atmosphere would be depleted from oxygen tomorrow. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1312.92s)]
*  If there were no trees around, we would suffocate. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1320.04s)]
*  I mean, and actually, in the course of this particular pandemic that we're going through, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1325.28s)]
*  I think people are discovering that they need the natural world for their very sanity. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1332.44s)]
*  People who never listened to the birdsong are suddenly thrilled, excited, supported, inspired by the natural world. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1337.48s)]
*  And they realize that they are not apart from it. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1346.6s)]
*  They are part of it. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1349.9599999999998s)]
*  So by saving nature, we are saving ourselves? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1352.32s)]
*  Oh, without question. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1354.7199999999998s)]
*  You say in the film, we're not just ruining the world, we've destroyed it. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1356.24s)]
*  Is it that far gone? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1360.08s)]
*  It's not beyond redemption. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1366.24s)]
*  Redemption, he says, depends on a complete shift to renewable energy [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1369.24s)]
*  and an end of our reliance on fossil fuels. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1373.68s)]
*  The fossil fuel industry does not want the world to move off fossil fuels. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1376.8s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1381.32s)]
*  But in fact, we know ways in which we can get from the sun up there, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1382.76s)]
*  just a tiny fraction of the amount of energy that sprays on this earth 24 hours a day, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1388.16s)]
*  one way or another, for nothing. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1394.6000000000001s)]
*  If we could solve the problems of storage and transmission, the world is ours. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1397.6399999999999s)]
*  We have all the power we need. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1402.7199999999998s)]
*  Why should we go on poisoning life on earth? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1405.56s)]
*  It sounds simple when you say it. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1410.0s)]
*  So it is. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1412.56s)]
*  Sir David also wants to see what he calls a rewilding of the planet, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1414.1999999999998s)]
*  giving plants and animals on land and in the ocean time and space to bounce back. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1418.8799999999999s)]
*  The World Wildlife Fund says the two thirds of the earth's wildlife [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1425.56s)]
*  has disappeared in the past 50 years. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1429.32s)]
*  Repopulation of the oceans can happen like that in a decade, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1432.52s)]
*  if we have the will to do it. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1439.56s)]
*  But we require everybody to agree that. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1441.52s)]
*  If you were to pick up the phone and speak with President Trump or President Xi of China [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1444.48s)]
*  or Prime Minister Modi in India, what would you say? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1450.08s)]
*  I would say that the time has come to put aside national ambitions [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1453.6s)]
*  and look for an international ambition of survival. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1461.1999999999998s)]
*  It seems politically the tide is moving in the opposite direction from that, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1467.24s)]
*  of nations more looking inward and not as being part of a larger international community. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1471.3999999999999s)]
*  That's what's going to sink us in the end. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1477.56s)]
*  That's what's going to sink us. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1481.2s)]
*  Can you be optimistic at all? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1484.2s)]
*  We don't have an alternative. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1486.52s)]
*  I mean, what good is it to say, oh, to hell with it, I don't care? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1489.52s)]
*  You can't say that. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1495.0s)]
*  Not if you love your children, not if you love the rest of humanity. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1496.76s)]
*  How can you say that? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1503.0400000000002s)]
*  It's the young that Sir David now puts his faith in, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1504.92s)]
*  and they, it seems, have faith in him. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1508.16s)]
*  Just listen to the reception he received when he popped up on stage [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1511.92s)]
*  at Britain's largest music festival. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1515.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1517.68s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1519.3200000000002s)]
*  There is a huge movement around the world of people from all nations, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1522.48s)]
*  young people who can see what is happening to the world [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1526.6000000000001s)]
*  and demanding that their governments should take action. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1530.0s)]
*  That's the best hope that I have. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1533.8000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, my generation failed. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1538.28s)]
*  We've allowed it to happen. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1540.52s)]
*  We've allowed this to happen, Sir David Attenborough says, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1542.2s)]
*  despite being the smartest creatures that have ever lived. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1545.44s)]
*  Now, he warns, we need more than just intelligence. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1548.68s)]
*  We need wisdom. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1552.16s)]
*  After all, this planet is all we have. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1553.52s)]
*  There is nowhere else to go. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1556.92s)]
*  Do you believe there's life elsewhere? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1559.44s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1561.6s)]
*  But also, I think that that's a... [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1563.12s)]
*  I mean, it's an interesting theoretical question, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1565.72s)]
*  but it's a theoretical question. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1568.24s)]
*  Why would I want to go and live on the moon [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1571.08s)]
*  when I've got this world of badgers and thrushes and jellyfish and corals? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1574.28s)]
*  Why would I want to go and live in the moon? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1582.6799999999998s)]
*  Because there's nothing else there but dust. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1586.6s)]
*  I'd say, well, thank you very much. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1589.32s)]
*  I'll stay where I am and watch hummingbirds. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1590.36s)]
*  This Independence Day, we turn to a man [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1602.84s)]
*  who tells the story of America in her glory and struggle for unity. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1606.04s)]
*  Ken Burns' documentaries range from The Civil War to baseball, country music, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1612.4399999999998s)]
*  and this year's Ernest Hemingway. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1618.8000000000002s)]
*  As we first told you last fall, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1621.44s)]
*  Burns calls himself an emotional archaeologist. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1623.5600000000002s)]
*  He excavates lost love letters, forgotten photos and overlooked heroes. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1627.5600000000002s)]
*  Research so deep, viewers can feel like strangers [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1633.4s)]
*  discovering America for the first time. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1637.72s)]
*  His films ask what it means to be American. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1640.6000000000001s)]
*  So we asked, what does it mean to be Ken Burns? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1643.6000000000001s)]
*  I have had the privilege of spending my entire life making films about the US, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1648.48s)]
*  capital U, capital S. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1653.84s)]
*  But I've also had the privilege of making films about us, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1655.84s)]
*  the two letter lowercase plural pronoun that has a kind of intimacy and warmth to it. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1659.96s)]
*  In the country music film, Merle Haggard says, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1666.52s)]
*  country music is about those things we believe in, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1670.64s)]
*  but can't see like dreams and songs and souls. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1674.48s)]
*  It's telling us that there is in front of us a kind of rational world [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1680.24s)]
*  in which one and one always equals two, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1685.76s)]
*  but that the thing that compels us forward as human beings [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1688.68s)]
*  is that we look for one and one equaling three. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1692.6s)]
*  We find that in our faith. We find that in our art. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1695.6s)]
*  We find that in our love of each other. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1698.2s)]
*  And I think one of the things I discovered working on country music [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1700.68s)]
*  is that when I understood this dynamic between the US and us, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1704.4s)]
*  lowercase, uppercase, that I realized there's only us, no them. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1709.92s)]
*  The choice was easy because... [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1714.48s)]
*  Us, the American struggle to forge union from diversity, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1715.92s)]
*  has been Ken Burns' obsession since he was 11 years old [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1721.0s)]
*  at the end of this lane in Ann Arbor, Michigan. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1724.3200000000002s)]
*  In 1965, his mother was dying of cancer. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1728.0800000000002s)]
*  At the same time, the fight for equality was in critical condition. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1732.3999999999999s)]
*  Before my mom died, I would watch and I would hear from the other room [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1736.6399999999999s)]
*  about the dogs and the fire hoses in Selma. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1740.76s)]
*  And it would make me as upset, as upset in my gut as the worry about my mom. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1743.76s)]
*  And it was almost as if I was transposing the cancer that was killing my family [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1751.6s)]
*  and the cancer that was killing my country. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1758.0s)]
*  And if you look at my films, almost 40 of them, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1759.76s)]
*  you can count on the fingers of one hand, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1762.96s)]
*  the number of films that don't end up dealing with race. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1765.56s)]
*  His early films included the Statue of Liberty and the Congress. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1769.16s)]
*  But it wasn't until his seventh that America returned Ken Burns' affection. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1773.48s)]
*  The Civil War was seen by 39 million viewers, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1784.08s)]
*  an 11-hour epic that immortalized a love letter and a waltz. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1787.92s)]
*  The Ashokan Farewell. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1793.44s)]
*  The Fiddle Tune. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1795.04s)]
*  The Fiddle Tune. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1795.96s)]
*  That you can never get out of your head years later. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1796.8000000000002s)]
*  The lament seemed written as a score for the letter Union soldier Sullivan Ballew [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1803.4s)]
*  wrote his wife a week before his death. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1809.0800000000002s)]
*  I shall always be with you in the brightest day and the darkest night. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1812.68s)]
*  Always. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1817.08s)]
*  Always. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1818.96s)]
*  And when the soft breeze fans your cheek, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1822.52s)]
*  it shall be my breath or the cool air your throbbing temple. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1825.64s)]
*  It shall be my spirit passing by. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1830.24s)]
*  I think every man wishes he could say those words to the woman he loves [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1832.96s)]
*  and every woman wishes that her man could say that. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1837.52s)]
*  That may be our shot. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1840.56s)]
*  Burns' films are a letter to the country he loves, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1842.8s)]
*  but not out of blind devotion. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1846.48s)]
*  His is the affection that endures after confronting America's founding flaw. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1849.1200000000001s)]
*  We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1855.8s)]
*  Yet he owned more than 200 human beings and never saw fit to free them. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1863.1200000000001s)]
*  Burns finds the American paradox in the wars we fight and the games we play. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1870.44s)]
*  I told people that baseball was the sequel to the Civil War and I meant it. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1876.4s)]
*  I meant it. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1880.76s)]
*  How we play games and the nature of immigration and the exclusion of women [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1881.8400000000001s)]
*  and popular culture and advertising and heroes and villains in our imagination [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1886.2800000000002s)]
*  and race and race and race are who we are. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1891.52s)]
*  And the first real progress in civil rights after the Civil War [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1898.0s)]
*  takes place when Jack Roosevelt Robinson, the grandson of a slave, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1903.6399999999999s)]
*  makes his way to first base at Ebbets Field on April 15, 1947, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1909.12s)]
*  then there's no question that the story of baseball is just going to take off [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1914.6399999999999s)]
*  from the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the failure of Reconstruction [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1919.1599999999999s)]
*  and move to that moment. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1924.48s)]
*  Ken Burns' moment came in 1981 with his first subject, the Brooklyn Bridge, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1927.48s)]
*  which no one thought was a good idea. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1933.2s)]
*  Well, you had an inanimate object and no one to interview. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1935.92s)]
*  Right. Great television. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1939.2s)]
*  Yes. And I looked 12 years old, so I was out trying to raise money [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1940.48s)]
*  and they'd say, this child is trying to sell me the Brooklyn Bridge. No. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1943.72s)]
*  PBS bought the Brooklyn Bridge and Burns structured his style, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1949.44s)]
*  animating images frozen in time and giving them voice. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1955.2s)]
*  Here I was, 32 years old, suddenly in charge of the most [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1961.24s)]
*  stupendous engineering structure of the age. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1965.08s)]
*  Famous voices volunteer just to be in a Ken Burns film. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1968.24s)]
*  Meryl Streep as Eleanor Roosevelt. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1972.84s)]
*  Courage is more exhilarating than fear. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1975.92s)]
*  Tom Hanks in The War. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1981.0s)]
*  You'd never realize now that he was one of those emaciated, tortured souls [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1984.08s)]
*  who survived by some miracle, the horror of that death march at Batan. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1988.72s)]
*  His films have the pace of patient revelation. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=1996.28s)]
*  And time to think. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2001.04s)]
*  This is a beautiful part of the country. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2007.44s)]
*  It's the rhythm of a director who lives not in New York or L.A., [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2009.44s)]
*  but on 50 acres of Walpole, New Hampshire, where even his apples [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2013.52s)]
*  have history. So these are cuttings that were taken from trees at Monticello. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2018.72s)]
*  Of course they are. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2025.84s)]
*  We met Burns before the pandemic. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2028.2s)]
*  At 67, he has four daughters from two marriages. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2030.92s)]
*  But his longest relationship for decades is with PBS. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2035.2s)]
*  I'm fortunate that PBS exists. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2040.3600000000001s)]
*  I can go tomorrow to a premium channel or some place. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2043.64s)]
*  Streaming service and get 30 million dollars to do Vietnam. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2048.12s)]
*  But no one's going to say you can take ten and a half years. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2052.04s)]
*  This was the main bedroom. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2055.44s)]
*  He can take his time because he raises the money and runs his own company, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2056.96s)]
*  Florentine Films. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2061.08s)]
*  Producers, writers, historians, editors and photographers [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2064.52s)]
*  craft a half dozen films at once. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2068.36s)]
*  So Burns can release about one a year, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2071.08s)]
*  even though a series like Country Music takes eight years to finish. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2074.04s)]
*  Country Music, the songwriter Harlan Howard said, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2079.2s)]
*  his three chords and the truth. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2083.16s)]
*  He's a great. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2086.04s)]
*  You listen to 15000 songs, sifted through more than 100000 still [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2087.3199999999997s)]
*  photos and did 101 on camera interviews. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2093.2799999999997s)]
*  Why so much? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2098.64s)]
*  One would think that making a film is an additive process. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2100.2s)]
*  You're building this. It's not. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2104.68s)]
*  It's subtractive. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2106.7599999999998s)]
*  The best metaphor I know of is we make maple syrup here in this town [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2108.08s)]
*  and it takes 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of maple syrup. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2114.56s)]
*  And that's what the process is. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2118.48s)]
*  Burns has boiled down the history of Mark Twain, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2120.2799999999997s)]
*  the national parks, plus 18 hours on Vietnam and 19 hours of jazz. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2123.72s)]
*  Ken's films touched something at the heart of our mythology [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2130.3999999999996s)]
*  and who we have been at our best and at our worst and who we want to be. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2135.3599999999997s)]
*  Composer Wynton Marsalis collaborated on jazz and country music. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2141.8399999999997s)]
*  Marsalis is artistic director of New York's Jazz at Lincoln Center [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2146.6s)]
*  and something of an expert on improvising with Ken Burns. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2150.56s)]
*  He'll be vibrating and that'll be in the fourth year of something. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2155.0s)]
*  And it'll be one o'clock in the morning after you've worked since nine o'clock [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2158.96s)]
*  in the morning. So now it's one o'clock. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2162.76s)]
*  So he's still like, no, no, right here. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2164.8s)]
*  We need to, right here. We need to. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2166.96s)]
*  And to see like a person with that type of energy and just on fire like that. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2168.44s)]
*  And as he's grown older, it's gotten worse. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2173.52s)]
*  So, you know, the fire's gotten bigger. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2176.2400000000002s)]
*  The fire is the fires and just the enthusiasm, fire, the passion. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2178.44s)]
*  Ken told us that you see him. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2183.2000000000003s)]
*  So what do you see? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2186.88s)]
*  You know, for me, I always see like a kid. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2188.88s)]
*  If you can retain that childish [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2191.4s)]
*  war and wonderment and belief that you can change things, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2194.44s)]
*  if you can maintain that. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2198.8s)]
*  And that's what I see in him. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2200.7200000000003s)]
*  And we found this little tiny place, childish [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2202.36s)]
*  awe and wonderment that somehow survived his childhood. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2205.0s)]
*  Would you say you had a happy childhood? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2209.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't think I had a childhood. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2212.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, I did. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2213.56s)]
*  And I had happy moments, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2214.64s)]
*  but my mother got cancer very early on, and that was the shadow [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2216.8399999999997s)]
*  cast across my brother and my childhood. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2221.12s)]
*  We also had a father who was not mentally healthy. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2224.56s)]
*  He was a functioning person, but he was an unhappy man. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2228.56s)]
*  Depression, depression, maybe bipolar, never accurately diagnosed. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2233.56s)]
*  Burns was thirty nine when he realized he was trapped behind the wall [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2239.24s)]
*  he built to shield himself from his mother's death. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2244.08s)]
*  The revelation came from his father in law. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2248.08s)]
*  And he said, I bet you blew out your candles as a child, as a boy, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2251.04s)]
*  wishing she'd come back. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2255.3599999999997s)]
*  I said, yeah, how, you know? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2256.3599999999997s)]
*  And he goes, look what you do for a living. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2258.16s)]
*  You wake the dead. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2260.72s)]
*  You make Abraham Lincoln and Jackie Robinson come alive. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2262.56s)]
*  Who do you think you really want to wake up? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2265.3199999999997s)]
*  So I called my brother and we wept and we said we have to find mommy. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2268.68s)]
*  They had to find her because she'd been buried in an unmarked [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2273.8399999999997s)]
*  Popper's grave with 28 souls simply because Burns' father [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2277.96s)]
*  never retrieved her ashes from the funeral home. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2282.96s)]
*  It's a long and complicated story. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2286.4s)]
*  Like researching a story, Ken and his filmmaker brother, Rick, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2288.52s)]
*  tracked their history to the mass grave where they placed a memorial [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2293.12s)]
*  to Lila Burns. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2297.56s)]
*  The ability to say to the world, this is us [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2299.7999999999997s)]
*  wouldn't have been possible without the crucible [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2305.48s)]
*  of her sickness, her death, and even that long wilderness [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2309.64s)]
*  of not dealing with it. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2314.84s)]
*  And dealing with it, I think, has made me a better filmmaker. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2317.84s)]
*  A filmmaker working through the chapters of a single subject [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2323.04s)]
*  because Burns found, as Walt Whitman wrote, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2327.04s)]
*  these states are the ampulist poem. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2330.3599999999997s)]
*  I am working on seven films right now. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2333.92s)]
*  I mean, we got Ernest Hemingway. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2336.12s)]
*  We have Muhammad Ali. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2337.7599999999998s)]
*  We have Benjamin Franklin. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2339.64s)]
*  We have LBJ biographies. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2340.8399999999997s)]
*  We're doing a history of the American Revolution and a biography of the buffalo. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2342.56s)]
*  They are together the story of a people straining for union, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2346.92s)]
*  a theme Ken Burns has explored from his very first film, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2351.0s)]
*  which was, after all, about a bridge connecting America to America. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2355.32s)]
*  This is what stories do. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2361.32s)]
*  They do liberate us from the tyrannies [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2362.96s)]
*  of our limitations and our past and our foibles. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2367.4s)]
*  And so this is what we human beings do [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2372.92s)]
*  to negotiate this all too short passage that we call life. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2376.84s)]
*  And I am so grateful that I live in the United States of America. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2381.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean that. I mean that. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2387.12s)]
*  And that I get to tell stories about us, the U.S. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2390.08s)]
*  For the record, it's iron ore, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2407.2s)]
*  but it's easy to make the case that Australia's leading export is acting talent. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2409.16s)]
*  How has an island of only 27 million people minted Nicole Kidman, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2414.2s)]
*  Hugh Jackman, Cate Blanchett, Mel Gibson, Margot Robbie, Chris Hemsworth? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2418.4s)]
*  We can keep going here. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2422.68s)]
*  Sarah Snook, Russell Crowe, Heath Ledger, Naomi Watts [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2424.16s)]
*  to say nothing of so many Oscar winning directors, designers and crew. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2426.88s)]
*  We headed to the bottom of the globe and then other spots on the globe [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2430.6s)]
*  to explore the Aussie takeover. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2433.96s)]
*  We met stars. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2436.08s)]
*  We heard theories. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2437.04s)]
*  And in a quiet Sydney neighborhood, impossibly far and away from Hollywood, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2438.12s)]
*  we found a place that pumps out talent. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2443.08s)]
*  Seen London's West End, its theater district, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2447.68s)]
*  Sarah Snook is fresh off her Emmy winning breakthrough role as Shiv Roy. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2451.36s)]
*  Well, it's not all about you. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2456.08s)]
*  The vicious yet vulnerable daughter in the HBO show succession. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2457.72s)]
*  If only I could remain always young for her next act. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2461.84s)]
*  She's up the degree of difficulty and pivoted from TV to live performance, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2465.7599999999998s)]
*  playing all 26 roles in an innovative multimedia staging of Oscar Wilde's [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2470.52s)]
*  The Picture of Doreen Gray, a theatrical sensation coming soon to Broadway. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2475.96s)]
*  I would give my soul for that. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2480.6s)]
*  It's not unheard of for someone to have a successful run in TV or film [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2482.72s)]
*  and then go do theater. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2486.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure I've seen someone do 26 roles of theater at once. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2488.12s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2492.44s)]
*  You know, it's an incredible play, an incredible opportunity [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2493.36s)]
*  to be able to play so many different roles and so many different characters. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2496.4s)]
*  And, you know, it's that thing of you come off some of the best [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2499.96s)]
*  writing in the world. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2502.2400000000002s)]
*  What do you do next? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2503.6400000000003s)]
*  Something has to be, you know, out there to challenge you. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2504.8s)]
*  And this certainly is, yeah, the challenge. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2508.6000000000004s)]
*  If it's an unusual bit of career management, it's also on brand [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2511.36s)]
*  as the kind of daring move you would expect from a modern Australian star. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2515.48s)]
*  What is going through your head during this performance [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2520.1600000000003s)]
*  with all of these marks and rolls and lines and angles? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2522.84s)]
*  Nothing, which is quite nice. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2528.28s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2530.32s)]
*  The focus required is is a kind of a state of meditative flow in a way, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2531.04s)]
*  because if I'm sitting there going, oh, am I on my mark? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2538.0s)]
*  Am I doing this? Then the next line has happened. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2541.52s)]
*  So if I think about anything else, then I'm stitched up. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2543.6800000000003s)]
*  Stitched up? That's Aussie for in a jam. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2546.96s)]
*  Didn't know Sarah Snook was Australian. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2550.6400000000003s)]
*  You're pathetic. You're a masochist and you can't even take it. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2552.72s)]
*  If you couldn't have guessed by the accent, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2555.04s)]
*  well, get to that soon. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2558.7599999999998s)]
*  You might have guessed it by simply playing the percentages. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2560.3599999999997s)]
*  Name an A-list star of the stage or screen today. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2565.24s)]
*  Odds are blooming good. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2568.3999999999996s)]
*  They come from the land down under. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2569.9599999999996s)]
*  There are a lot of you, aren't there? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2572.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's a few of us out there. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2573.3599999999997s)]
*  Here's this country. Yeah. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2575.08s)]
*  Fewer people in Texas. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2577.04s)]
*  Is it really? Stop it. Really? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2578.72s)]
*  Pretty good ratio. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2581.6s)]
*  I was going to say, you guys are doing pretty well for yourself. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2582.48s)]
*  Not so bad. Not so bad. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2584.44s)]
*  Jake. Yes, they are everywhere. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2587.44s)]

*  Oh, are you? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2594.76s)]
*  Yes, this is what I was supposed to do. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2597.04s)]
*  They've brought us her and him. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2599.96s)]
*  Don't touch my things. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2603.48s)]

*  Are you not entertained? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2607.56s)]
*  Heroes upon this moment and villains. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2609.08s)]
*  Why so serious? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2612.7599999999998s)]
*  Earning top billings for real actors. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2615.6s)]

*  I'm an Australian who played an Australian in. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2629.52s)]
*  Aussies may become to Hollywood what Kenyans are to marathoning, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2631.72s)]
*  wildly overrepresented and not just in front of the camera. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2635.92s)]
*  I need a moment. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2640.08s)]
*  And action. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2641.52s)]
*  Fade in. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2644.72s)]
*  Take filmmaker Baz Luhrmann, a singular creative force, almost a genre unto himself. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2645.7599999999998s)]
*  He spoke to us from a far flung location where he was scouting his next film. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2651.3199999999997s)]
*  It's got to a point where there are so many Australian [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2655.7599999999998s)]
*  performers and actors behind the screen. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2659.36s)]
*  I mean, screenplay, writing and directing, but particularly with actors [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2663.4s)]
*  that even I have to be told, oh, you know, X is Australian. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2667.32s)]
*  I mean, I didn't know that because they are really everywhere. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2670.88s)]
*  Now, neither was a really big part of that because I think it kind of [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2674.52s)]
*  set the culture and set the attitude. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2679.32s)]
*  NIDA, the National Institute of Dramatic Art. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2683.48s)]
*  Think of it as the Julliard of Australia. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2686.76s)]
*  Up through the sky. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2689.0s)]
*  Its rise to prominence marks a major plot point in the Aussie cinematic invasion. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2690.6s)]
*  The acceptance rate is barely two percent. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2695.7200000000003s)]
*  Naomi Watts and Hugh Jackman were among those declined. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2698.48s)]
*  Baz Luhrmann was class of 1985. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2701.96s)]
*  Sarah Snook, class of 2008, one of only 24 admitted students that year. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2705.1600000000003s)]
*  At NIDA, Snook received training in the classics experimental theater [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2710.92s)]
*  and also picked up some hacks. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2715.28s)]
*  I was told I had to ask you about how you cried during [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2717.2s)]
*  Chekhov during the Three Sisters performance. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2720.64s)]
*  Who told you that? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2722.7599999999998s)]
*  We've got our sources. We do our research here. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2723.6s)]
*  Yeah, I... [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2728.52s)]
*  There was a few of us who were nervous about having to, you know, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2730.8399999999997s)]
*  instantaneously produce tears. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2734.2799999999997s)]
*  And so we were very cheeky and would put Tiger Balm on a little handkerchief. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2736.44s)]
*  And when we were behind a particular screen, we would just put [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2742.7599999999998s)]
*  the Tiger Balm in our eyes. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2746.64s)]

*  You can't be CEO. You can't because you killed someone. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2754.0s)]
*  At less risk to her health, there she also learned to mask that [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2757.4s)]
*  charming Aussie accent. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2761.52s)]
*  How often do you get... [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2763.48s)]
*  She's Australian? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2764.92s)]
*  I do, yeah, frequently. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2766.24s)]
*  Is that something they taught you at NIDA at all? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2767.92s)]
*  Yeah, accent work at NIDA, you know, British accents, American accents. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2770.16s)]
*  Thinking that's one more thing you've got to think about. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2774.2400000000002s)]
*  Not just your lines and not just... [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2777.16s)]
*  No, I know. That was the thing on the show. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2779.12s)]
*  We always had to... [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2781.16s)]
*  You know, there was often times where we had to improvise. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2782.92s)]
*  And so I had to try and think in an American accent as well, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2785.2000000000003s)]
*  which is tricky. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2789.04s)]
*  Lerman, too, still leans on his NIDA training. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2791.7200000000003s)]
*  The National Institute of Dramatic Art, the drama school I went to. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2794.88s)]
*  I mean, I do remember one thing, and I think it's sort of an Australian attitude, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2798.32s)]
*  which is don't wait for permission to be told that you can act. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2803.28s)]
*  We were taught to devise things. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2808.32s)]
*  We were taught not to sit around and, OK, there's the play. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2810.0400000000004s)]
*  That's your part. You may be in it. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2813.6800000000003s)]
*  We were taught to make up story, get with friends, make a show, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2815.88s)]
*  create something. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2820.6800000000003s)]
*  I had an idea that I would take the Greek myth [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2822.28s)]
*  and with a bunch of friends devise it and set it in the world of ballroom [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2825.84s)]
*  dancing while I was at the National Institute of Dramatic Art. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2830.4s)]
*  That little play went for about 30 minutes. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2833.92s)]
*  It was called Strictly Ballroom. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2836.12s)]
*  Within a few years, Lerman had turned that little play into a worldwide film, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2840.7200000000003s)]
*  a cult hit with all Aussie cast and crew. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2845.56s)]
*  That was 1992. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2848.84s)]
*  Then Australia was still a theatrical outback of sorts. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2850.96s)]
*  True, Errol Flynn was born in Tasmania, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2855.2400000000002s)]
*  but Australia's contribution to the silver screen extended not much beyond, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2858.08s)]
*  well, this. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2862.9599999999996s)]
*  That's a knife. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2865.8799999999997s)]
*  Then the knight of talent started filtering out. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2867.9199999999996s)]
*  Mel Gibson, you want to see crazy? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2871.0s)]
*  Cate Blanchett. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2874.2s)]
*  Excuse me, Queenie here? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2875.3599999999997s)]
*  Because nobody admits anything they've done. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2877.16s)]
*  Tony Collette, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2880.0s)]
*  Baz Luhrmann's wife, the four time Oscar winning costume [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2882.08s)]
*  and production designer Katherine Martin is another night of grad. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2885.32s)]
*  Help us understand where Nida fits into the broader entertainment industry [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2889.0800000000004s)]
*  that can do will tell, you know, don't wait for permission attitude [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2894.76s)]
*  that Nida instilled in the very first graduates. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2900.44s)]
*  That was spilt out into the kind of larger sense [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2905.52s)]
*  of what it was to be, you know, a performer in Australia, you know, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2909.4s)]
*  just throwing yourself off the cliff and. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2914.16s)]
*  Flying, we didn't want it to be in Sydney. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2920.16s)]
*  We found the godfather, the guru. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2923.28s)]
*  Now, 92, John Clark was Nida's all powerful director for 35 years, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2925.88s)]
*  starting in 1969. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2931.12s)]
*  He set a goal from the start, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2933.24s)]
*  developing and unlocking a distinct Aussie mode of acting, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2934.96s)]
*  marrying the theater of London with Hollywood gloss. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2939.24s)]
*  We thought the method acting was having such an influence [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2942.6400000000003s)]
*  and everybody was emoting and the style of acting was terribly emotional [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2948.44s)]
*  and lacking in skill and imagination. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2954.52s)]
*  So we thought, no, we've got to find a way of doing it. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2957.6800000000003s)]
*  That takes the best of America and the best of Britain, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2961.48s)]
*  but allows their own national characteristics to develop. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2966.32s)]
*  What makes Australian acting unique? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2970.6s)]
*  Skill, confidence, courage [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2973.2799999999997s)]
*  and enjoyment of the body. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2978.6s)]
*  And Nida's never encouraged self-indulgence or show off acting. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2980.88s)]
*  The actors who have done well in Hollywood, they are not acting with a capital A. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2986.48s)]
*  They are playing characters with such conviction and with such truth [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2991.4s)]
*  without what Australians would call decoration or bullsh**. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=2998.32s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3003.92s)]
*  It's straight down the middle and they do their homework. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3004.92s)]
*  They're highly intelligent. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3008.4s)]
*  Mr. Anderson, welcome back. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3010.28s)]
*  And they know who the person is they're playing. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3012.56s)]
*  You like what I've done with the place? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3016.52s)]
*  In addition to running Nida, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3020.6s)]
*  John Clark co-founded the Sydney Theatre Company, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3022.08s)]
*  a harborside band box where Nida students can launch careers [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3025.04s)]
*  and established stars can come back home to get back to basics. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3029.28s)]
*  You drew me, didn't you? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3033.2400000000002s)]
*  Yet another supporting role in this story, Aussie soap operas. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3034.36s)]
*  Seriously, don't judge the soaps enable actors to sharpen their skills [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3038.28s)]
*  day in, day out before their call ups. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3042.6400000000003s)]
*  Did the cops talk to you? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3044.84s)]
*  Australia has all these institutions of Nida, Sydney Theatre Company, the soaps. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3046.7200000000003s)]
*  What contributions do they make to this overrepresentation of Aussies that we see? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3051.84s)]
*  A good training ground. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3057.2400000000002s)]
*  Australia's got great training grounds for international work. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3058.2000000000003s)]
*  There's a way you can you can test yourself in Australia and you can fail safely in a way. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3061.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think failure is really important to see your limits and to help grow. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3065.8s)]
*  Hardly a child star, Snook grew up as a typical Aussie free range kid. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3069.4s)]
*  You're telling me about your upbringing. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3074.6000000000004s)]
*  You're riding a bike in the national park in southern Australia with kangaroos. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3076.04s)]
*  I feel like that's a real grounding force in my life. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3081.24s)]
*  Having that independent play in sort of risky areas that breeds a lot of self reliance in a kid. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3084.68s)]
*  These experiences you had on the other side of the world actually really help you. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3091.68s)]
*  They build your character so that you can play other characters. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3096.24s)]
*  For all of the pathways in infrastructure, there's something else about Aussies. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3100.52s)]
*  And there's probably a lesson here for all of us. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3104.6s)]
*  Simply put, they're the anti divas. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3107.6s)]
*  Doing drama, not bringing drama to work. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3110.48s)]
*  The things that I really respect about the Australian actors that I love overseas, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3113.6800000000003s)]
*  there is a bit of a understanding that it's it's all oftentimes smoke and mirrors and it's fun and it's a game. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3118.32s)]
*  And it's you know, it is profound in some ways, but it's also silly. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3126.0s)]
*  Like Chris Hemsworth has got a great tongue in cheek sort of attitude about it all. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3129.88s)]
*  And also Baz Luhrmann, his films tend to have a bit of a little cheek or a wink to the audience. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3133.92s)]
*  The phrase in heavy rotation, we kept hearing those Aussies, they take the work seriously, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3139.92s)]
*  they don't take themselves particularly seriously. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3145.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. That's what it is. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3147.52s)]
*  Much better way of saying what I just said. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3148.96s)]
*  Finally, about that distance. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3153.44s)]
*  Baz Luhrmann believes that the remoteness of Australia, a place where actors can stretch their talents and [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3155.52s)]
*  horizons beyond the gaze of Hollywood tastemakers is in fact a blessing. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3161.52s)]
*  The one thing everyone agrees about with Australia is that it's far, far away. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3167.32s)]
*  And I think that we still think that the idea of being either in a movie or in a play on Broadway or in a television show in [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3172.8s)]
*  Hollywood is still a romantic notion. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3182.36s)]
*  It's still a privilege. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3185.96s)]
*  It isn't a job. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3187.4s)]
*  It's a dream. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bic7geBOIxE&t=3188.8s)]
