*  You have to have a certain amount of good criminal energy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=87.88s)]
*  To make a film. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=92.6s)]
*  Sometimes, yes. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=93.6s)]
*  You have to go outside of what the norm is. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=95.28s)]

*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=111.08s)]
*  Last month, the head of NORAD and NORTHCOM, the military commands that defend North America, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=123.0s)]
*  told Congress some of those mysterious drones seen flying inside the United States may indeed [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=129.24s)]
*  have been spying. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=135.8s)]
*  He did not say for whom. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=137.28s)]
*  60 Minutes has been looking into a series of eerily similar incidents going back years, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=139.68s)]
*  including those attention-getting flyovers in New Jersey recently. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=145.24s)]
*  In each, drones first appeared over restricted military or civilian sites, coming and going, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=149.4s)]
*  often literally under the radar. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  The wake-up call came just over a year ago, when drones invaded the skies above Langley [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=158.72s)]
*  Air Force Base in Virginia over 17 nights, forcing the relocation of our most advanced [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=164.12s)]
*  fighter jets. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  Our story starts with an eyewitness and an iPhone. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=172.08s)]
*  Close around 7 o'clock, I would say, I started seeing these reddish-orange flashing lights [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=177.0s)]
*  that were starting to come in from the Virginia Beach area. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=183.8s)]
*  It began slowly, like one at a time. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  Jonathan Butner's close encounter with drones came on December 14, 2023. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=190.44s)]
*  He was at his family's cabin on the James River in Virginia, about 100 miles south of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=196.56s)]
*  Washington, D.C., with a commanding view of several military installations across the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=201.92s)]
*  water. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=207.72s)]
*  They started really coming in, like almost like on a conveyor belt. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=208.72s)]
*  How many in total? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=212.52s)]
*  I probably saw upwards of 40-plus. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=213.52s)]
*  When I first saw that, I was like, those are going directly over Langley Air Force [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=216.88s)]
*  Base. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=221.84s)]
*  Langley is one of the most critical air bases on the East Coast, home to dozens of F-22 [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  Raptors, the most advanced stealth fighter jets ever built. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=231.44s)]
*  Butner says from his perch, he has seen it all. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=236.68s)]
*  I'm very familiar with all the different types of military craft. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=239.8s)]
*  We have Black Hawks, we have the F-22s, and these were like nothing I've ever seen. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=242.88s)]
*  Butner took these iPhone videos of the objects coming and going for nearly an hour and a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=249.24s)]
*  half. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=254.68s)]
*  These are the only public videos of the drones over Langley. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=255.68s)]
*  He shared this video with the FBI for its investigation. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=261.28s)]
*  And another. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=265.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=266.28s)]
*  The reports were coming in 20 to 30 sightings, same time every evening, 30 to 45 minutes [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=267.28s)]
*  after sunset. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=272.52s)]
*  Retired four-star general Mark Kelly was the highest ranking officer at Langley to witness [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=274.0s)]
*  the swarm. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  A veteran fighter pilot, Kelly went up to the roof of a squadron headquarters for an [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  unobstructed view of the airborne invaders. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=285.44s)]
*  So what did you see? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  What you saw was different sizes of incursions of aircraft. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  You saw different altitudes, different airspeed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=294.44s)]
*  Some were rather loud, some weren't near as loud. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=297.32s)]
*  What was the smallest one? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=301.0s)]
*  What was the largest one? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=302.04s)]
*  The smallest, you know, you're talking about a commercial-sized quadcopter. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=304.0s)]
*  And then the largest ones are probably the size of what I would call a bass boat or a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=308.6s)]
*  small car. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=313.64000000000004s)]
*  The size of a small car. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=314.64000000000004s)]
*  At the time, General Glenn Van Hurk was joint commander of NORAD and NORTHCOM, the military [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=316.82000000000005s)]
*  commands that protect North American airspace. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=322.92s)]
*  He has since retired. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  I actually provided support in the form of fighters. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  Gun warning and control platforms, helicopters to try to further categorize what those drones [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=331.44s)]
*  were at the time. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=338.68s)]
*  Ten months earlier, he ordered an F-22 from Langley to shoot down that Chinese spy balloon [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  over the Atlantic after it had sailed across the U.S. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=346.16s)]
*  But this time, he found himself ill-equipped to respond. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=350.4s)]
*  NORAD's radar systems, designed during the Cold War to detect high-altitude air, space [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=355.04s)]
*  or missile attacks, were unable to detect low-flying drones that could be seen with [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  the naked eye. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=366.5s)]
*  Why don't we just shoot them down? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=367.74s)]
*  Well, first you have to have the capability to detect, track, identify, make sure it's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=369.78000000000003s)]
*  not a civilian airplane flying around. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=375.18s)]
*  If you can do that, Bill, then it becomes a safety issue for the American public. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=378.88s)]
*  Firing missiles in our homeland is not taken lightly. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=385.42s)]
*  We're not able to track them? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=388.9s)]
*  We're not able to see where they originate? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=392.21999999999997s)]
*  No, it's a capability gap. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=394.46s)]
*  Certainly, they can come and go from any direction. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=397.06s)]
*  The FBI is looking at potential options, but they don't have an answer right now. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=399.94s)]
*  And there haven't been answers for similar encroachments for more than five years. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=405.06s)]
*  There are multiple UASs in the vicinity of Alhamlinson, CPA 100 feet in altitude off [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=410.06s)]
*  the bow. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=414.06s)]
*  In 2019, naval warships training off the California coast were shadowed for weeks by [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=415.06s)]
*  dozens of drones. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=421.46s)]
*  We have visual for probable unidentified drones, with course unknown and feet unknown. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=423.74s)]
*  For years, the Pentagon did little to dispel speculation. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=430.66s)]
*  These images, taken with night vision equipment, were UFOs. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=434.6s)]
*  But ships' logs show they were identified as drones at the time. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=439.14s)]
*  And the Navy suspected they came from this Hong Kong-flagged freighter sailing nearby, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=444.22s)]
*  but couldn't prove it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=449.3s)]
*  Since then, the defense news site, the War Zone, has documented dozens of drone intrusions [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=451.54s)]
*  at sensitive infrastructure and military installations. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=457.38000000000005s)]
*  In 2019, the Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona, the largest power producer in the country. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=461.5s)]
*  In 2024, an experimental weapons site in Southern California, where defense contractors [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=468.46s)]
*  are building the next generation of stealth bombers. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=474.44s)]
*  Last December, the Army confirmed 11 drone sightings over the Picatinny Arsenal in northern [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=478.06s)]
*  New Jersey, where advanced weapons are designed and built. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=483.62s)]
*  What is that? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=487.7s)]
*  Which ignited a public frenzy with sightings of unidentified flying objects all over the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=489.06s)]
*  region. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=495.06s)]
*  New Jersey remains the epicenter of the drone mystery. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=496.06s)]
*  While much of the country was fixated on New Jersey, another swarm of drones was disrupting [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=499.94s)]
*  operations at an air base in the UK, where U.S. nuclear weapons have been stored. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=505.14s)]
*  Clearly there is a military intelligence aspect of this. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=511.34000000000003s)]
*  Republican Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi is chairman of the Armed Services Committee [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=517.1s)]

*  We talked to him this past December. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=524.16s)]
*  Do you believe that these drones are a spying system, a spying platform? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=526.36s)]
*  What would a logical person conclude? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=533.4s)]
*  That. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  That these are spying incursions. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=538.7199999999999s)]
*  And yet, I can tell you, I am privy to classified briefings at the highest level. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  I think the Pentagon and the national security advisors are still mystified. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=550.96s)]
*  Still mystified? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=557.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=558.24s)]
*  More alarming? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=559.24s)]
*  With drones overhead, some of the F-22s stationed at Langley were moved to a nearby air base [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=560.74s)]
*  for their own protection. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=567.32s)]
*  There's a new wartime reality. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=569.48s)]
*  Drones that can spy can also destroy. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=572.22s)]
*  Deep inside Russia, advanced aircraft have been destroyed by Ukrainian drones. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=575.5s)]
*  General Van Hurk told us drones could do the same thing here. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=581.58s)]
*  I have seen video of drones in various sizes flying over the F-22 flight line at Langley. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=585.54s)]
*  What's your reaction to that? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=593.5s)]
*  They could drop ordnance on them, drop bombs on them. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=594.74s)]
*  They could crash into them to disable them. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=598.98s)]
*  Was that a concern? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=601.7s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=602.7s)]
*  It's a concern. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=603.7s)]
*  Small UAS or drones can do a myriad of missions. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=605.34s)]
*  President Biden was informed of the Langley intrusions, and meetings were held at the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=610.1s)]
*  White House to figure out how to bring the drones down. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=614.5s)]
*  But after 17 nights, the drone visitation stopped. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=618.4200000000001s)]
*  A senior official in the Biden White House later downplayed the incident to 60 Minutes, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=622.5400000000001s)]
*  saying it was likely the work of hobbyists. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=628.0200000000001s)]
*  From what you saw, did you rule out that these might be hobbyists sending these drones up? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=631.54s)]
*  No, it would be my assessment they weren't hobbyists because of the magnitude of the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=639.78s)]
*  events, the sizes of some of the drones, and the duration. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=644.5799999999999s)]
*  So what's going on? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=649.14s)]
*  Well I wish I had the answer. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=651.0999999999999s)]
*  It certainly could have a foreign nexus, a threat nexus. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=652.66s)]
*  They could be doing anything from surveilling critical infrastructure, just to the point [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=657.16s)]
*  of embarrassing us from the fact that they can do this on a day-to-day basis, and that [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=662.36s)]
*  we're not able to do anything about it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=667.8s)]
*  In overseas war zones, the U.S. military has broad authority to bring down menacing drones [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=670.48s)]
*  with gunfire, missiles, and electronic jamming. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=676.8399999999999s)]
*  Here at home, any of those actions would pose a threat to civilians on the ground and in [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=680.8s)]
*  the air. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=686.08s)]
*  Well we certainly need new systems to counter this threat. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=687.08s)]
*  A year ago, General Gregory Geo, a combat veteran, took control of NORAD and NORTHCOM. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=692.6800000000001s)]
*  He ordered a 90-day assessment of operations and says the drones, or UAVs, at Langley became [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=699.44s)]
*  the centerpiece. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=706.2s)]
*  We're the most powerful military on the face of the earth, and yet drones could fly over [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=707.2s)]
*  a major Air Force base, and we couldn't stop them? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=716.72s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=722.3s)]
*  Well I think the threat got ahead of our ability to detect and track the threat. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=724.14s)]
*  I think all eyes were rightfully overseas, where UAVs were being used on one-way attack [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=731.18s)]
*  to attack U.S. and coalition service members. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=737.38s)]
*  And the threat into U.S. probably caught us by surprise a little bit. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=741.82s)]
*  As it stands today, could you detect a swarm of drones flying over or flying into the airspace [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=746.9200000000001s)]
*  at Langley? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=757.44s)]
*  Could you detect that today? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=758.44s)]
*  At low altitude, probably not with your standard FAA or surveillance radars. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=762.12s)]
*  Complicating his efforts? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=771.92s)]
*  Bureaucracy. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=773.72s)]
*  When the drones flew outside the perimeter of Langley Air Force base, other agencies [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=775.26s)]
*  had jurisdiction. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=780.4s)]
*  The Coast Guard, FAA, FBI, and local police. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=781.88s)]
*  There was no one agency in charge. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=786.38s)]
*  So what did you determine went on at Langley? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=789.38s)]
*  Well that investigation is still ongoing, so I don't think we know entirely what happened. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=793.0s)]
*  You know, when we hear things from the White House that it's not deemed a threat, it seems [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=801.24s)]
*  to me that this is alarming. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=807.0s)]
*  I mean, this is kind of hair on fire time. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=809.0s)]
*  It is alarming. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=812.78s)]
*  And I would say that our hair is on fire here in NorthCom in a controlled way and we're [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=814.26s)]
*  moving out extremely quickly. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=820.0s)]
*  This past November, General Guillaume was given the authority to cut through the red [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=822.34s)]
*  tape and coordinate counter drone efforts across multiple government agencies. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=827.0600000000001s)]
*  He says new, more sensitive radar systems are being installed at strategic bases. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=832.98s)]
*  And NorthCom is developing what it calls flyaway kits with the latest anti-drone technology [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=839.0s)]
*  to be delivered to bases besieged by drones. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=845.32s)]
*  My goal is inside of a year that we would have the flyaway kit capability to augment [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=848.84s)]
*  the services and the installations if they're necessary. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=855.0s)]
*  So within a year, were Langley to happen again, there'd be some ability to respond? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=857.92s)]
*  That's my goal. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=866.54s)]
*  His predecessor, Glenn Van Hurk, says the Pentagon, White House and Congress have underestimated [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=867.54s)]
*  this massive vulnerability for far too long. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=873.86s)]
*  It's been one year since Langley had their drone incursion and we don't have the policies [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=877.8199999999999s)]
*  and laws in place to deal with this. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=884.8199999999999s)]
*  That's not a sense of urgency. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=887.02s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=889.0999999999999s)]
*  I think it's because there's a perception that this is Fortress America. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=891.66s)]
*  Two oceans on the east and west with friendly nations north and south and nobody's going [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=897.1999999999999s)]
*  to attack our homeland. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=902.78s)]
*  It's time we move beyond that assumption. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=904.6s)]
*  Why it is so hard to stop drone incursions. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=911.74s)]
*  There are gaps in capability. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=915.04s)]
*  There are gaps in policy. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=917.26s)]
*  At 60minutesovertime.com. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=918.86s)]
*  The United States Marine Band was founded in 1798. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=926.6s)]
*  Thomas Jefferson gave it its nickname, the President's Own. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=932.16s)]
*  Today, 135 Marines still perform the score of the White House from parties to inaugurations. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=937.24s)]
*  So there was excitement last year when the Marines judged a contest for teenage musicians. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=945.6s)]
*  The winners would perform with the band. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=952.48s)]
*  30 students were chosen, the concert was scheduled, but last month it was canceled. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=955.88s)]

*  This music had been planned for the canceled concert, Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, by John [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1010.34s)]
*  Philip Sousa. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1036.18s)]

*  And I believe that just as much as anyone else does. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1055.1s)]
*  But for that, we need these different perspectives. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1059.0s)]

*  suppressing vulnerability, we're suppressing the very essence of what makes us human. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1093.84s)]
*  We are devaluing our own humanity. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1099.3999999999999s)]

*  She and all the contestants had been organized by a Chicago-based nonprofit called Equity [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1145.7s)]
*  ARC, which connects student musicians of color with mentors and opportunities. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1152.72s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1159.24s)]
*  American orchestras today are 80% white, 11% Asian, 5% Hispanic, and 2% black. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1163.0800000000002s)]
*  No wonder that in 2022 Equity ARC's executive director got an unexpected call. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1172.64s)]
*  The Marines called you. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1179.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1181.3600000000001s)]
*  They called Stanford Thompson to ask how the band could reach out to musicians of color. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1182.36s)]
*  It's part of the band's mission to educate youth. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1188.34s)]
*  So in that phone call with the Marine band, I shared with them a lot of ideas, a lot that [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1191.6999999999998s)]
*  we have learned as an organization. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1197.86s)]
*  And when I got off the phone, it was crazy. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1199.9799999999998s)]
*  It was like, wait, let me call this guy back because I should be offering away some ideas [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1201.9399999999998s)]
*  that Equity ARC and the Marine band could work together. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1208.1s)]
*  We identified this high school age, this pre-college age, where a lot of musicians of color drop off. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1211.8s)]
*  We came up with the idea of, can we bring a select group that we would audition through [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1219.8999999999999s)]
*  a competitive process to Washington to be able to spend a couple of days with the band. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1225.06s)]
*  The couple of days were supposed to look like this. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1231.8s)]
*  Music students like Zakiya McCliny learning from the best. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1237.76s)]
*  And woodwinds, just a little bit more sound. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1243.22s)]
*  Z-t-t-t-ting, ting, ting, ting. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1245.0s)]
*  Their wind symphony was set for this May 4th until President Trump's executive order banning [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1248.5s)]
*  programs for diversity. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1256.0s)]
*  We've ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies all across the [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1258.56s)]
*  entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1265.42s)]
*  And our country will be woke no longer. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1274.42s)]
*  The president says he is building a colorblind merit-based society, a reaction to what many [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1282.42s)]
*  saw as progressive politics gone too far. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1288.78s)]
*  His order was comprehensive, calling diversity programs illegal and immoral discrimination [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1293.06s)]
*  and an immense public waste. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1299.9199999999998s)]
*  But that executive order is just the beginning. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1303.72s)]
*  All across the government, President Trump is rolling back 60 years of discrimination [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1306.9199999999998s)]
*  protections for women, older Americans, the disabled and people of color. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1311.98s)]
*  Trump rescinded President Johnson's 1965 ban on employment bias. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1319.1s)]
*  He closed the Social Security Office of Civil Rights and fired leaders of the Equal Employment [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1324.7s)]
*  Opportunity Commission, or EEOC, which investigates bias in the workplace. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1331.54s)]
*  I think we're at a pivotal moment in our society and we have to make a decision as [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1338.06s)]
*  to which way do we want to go. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1343.16s)]
*  Kerry Dominguez chaired the EEOC for George W. Bush. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1346.26s)]
*  Her family fled Cuba when she was 12. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1350.9s)]
*  The argument behind the executive order is that America has eliminated racism, that no [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1354.5s)]
*  one in this country is held back by race any longer. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1360.3s)]
*  The data would not support that. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1365.66s)]
*  The data, Dominguez told us, shows that the EEOC handles around 100,000 discrimination [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1368.3s)]
*  claims from Americans each year. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1375.62s)]
*  The executive order calls the kinds of programs that you used to enforce, quote, immoral. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1379.1399999999999s)]
*  I believe what is immoral is to deny people opportunities. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1387.7s)]
*  I have witnessed individuals who have beautiful resumes and they get an interview, they come [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1391.86s)]
*  in using a wheelchair and all of a sudden the opportunity is gone. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1396.9199999999998s)]
*  Degenerating people opportunities because of that lack of fairness is immoral. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1401.18s)]
*  That's the immoral part. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1407.5800000000002s)]
*  Fairness aside, in this email the Marine Bands commanding officer wrote, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1409.98s)]
*  Equity Arc Stan Thompson, as long as the executive order is in place, we will not be able to [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1414.8600000000001s)]
*  reschedule. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1421.38s)]
*  I am really sorry to be the bearer of this news. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1422.8200000000002s)]
*  My first thought was hopelessness in a way and heartbreak. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1428.06s)]
*  Did you have the sense that the concert was cancelled because of the color of your skin? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1434.3799999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1440.02s)]
*  I mean, I couldn't think of another reason really I had prepared. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1440.94s)]
*  I had done everything I could to be at the top. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1446.94s)]
*  And being Indian, I thought, yeah, what other reason would there be? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1450.82s)]
*  Any questions were answered this past week. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1458.74s)]
*  The students gathered in Washington for rehearsals and the performance. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1462.1399999999999s)]
*  Sixty minutes did what we often do, covered costs of plane tickets and travel to bring [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1466.62s)]
*  all of our interviewees to one place. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1472.98s)]
*  Equity Arc decided to book the rehearsal space and the concert hall and tried to replace [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1476.3799999999999s)]
*  the absent Marine Band, which turned out to be easy. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1483.5400000000002s)]
*  I just felt like, well, there's usually two responses to something. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1488.98s)]
*  You could complain about it or you could do something about it. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1493.38s)]
*  I chose the latter within seconds and it was the easiest decision ever. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1496.7s)]
*  Easy for John Abracchi-Amento and Jennifer Morata, retired Marine Band trumpeters. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1501.2600000000002s)]
*  Marines follow orders. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1508.6200000000001s)]
*  They don't have to like them. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1510.94s)]
*  What do you think the members of the band think of all of this? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1512.56s)]
*  I know them. I like the back of my hand. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1515.8s)]
*  So I don't think it's too much for me to go out and let them say how disappointed they were. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1517.82s)]
*  With the active duty Marines ordered to stand down, Equity Arc reached out to retirees who [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1524.8799999999999s)]
*  answered the call from everywhere. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1531.48s)]
*  Her band members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, West Point, the Naval Academy [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1536.56s)]
*  and the Marines. Jennifer Morata flew on her dime from LA. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1545.24s)]
*  When I got that email, I looked at my schedule and I said, I can move all of those things. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1550.98s)]
*  I booked a flight. It was literally one week ago and I'm here. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1555.04s)]
*  I challenge anyone, literally anyone to come to me and say, by having this concert, does [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1560.48s)]
*  damage to the United States. It doesn't. It brings out the best of us. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1565.46s)]
*  You were not meant to be here today. This ensemble was not meant to be heard. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1570.94s)]
*  And I wonder what this moment on this stage means to your heart. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1578.3s)]
*  My name is Sean Muzan. I'm here from Atlanta, Georgia. I'm a junior at Southwestern Cab [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1585.5s)]
*  High School. One thing that unites us all is this music. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1589.26s)]
*  I'm here because I love it. No other reason than all these amazing, talented people. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1593.3s)]
*  And I don't want this to be taken away from anybody because of someone else's personal [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1598.78s)]
*  opinion or just anything else besides why we like to do this. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1602.6200000000001s)]
*  My name is Vanessa Cabrera. I'm from Rockaway, New Jersey. We worked hard to be here. We [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1608.78s)]
*  belong here. We have the talent to be here. And this is not just for us, but for children [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1612.98s)]
*  and just people in the same situation that we are that nobody can tell you what to do. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1619.7s)]
*  You know, if you put your mind to something that you can accomplish that. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1626.14s)]
*  My name is Ricardo Lozaro. I'm from San Antonio, Texas. I just want the world to be a better [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1628.94s)]
*  place, but it seems like we're slowly straying away from that. And we got to make a change. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1634.5400000000002s)]
*  And I believe everyone here is capable of doing that. But are we going to do it? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1641.7800000000002s)]
*  Hi, my name is Julie Angeles Bowler. I retired after 23 years as the timpest of the U.S. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1646.7s)]
*  Army Band, Pershing's Own. We need all of this, not just musically, athletically, academically. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1653.7s)]
*  We need diversity, equity, and inclusion. Thank you very much. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1661.6200000000001s)]
*  The original Marine Band concert would have been seen by hundreds. Here tonight, these [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1666.98s)]
*  musicians are being heard by millions. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1673.22s)]
*  At the podium, Rodney Dorsey of Florida State University conducting Gallup by Dmitri Shostakovich [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1676.22s)]
*  in the hands of a band that looks like America. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1683.22s)]
*  Werner Herzog may not be a household name, but he is one of the most respected and unusual [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1713.22s)]
*  filmmakers of our time. Over the last six decades, the German director has made more [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1738.18s)]
*  than 70 documentaries and feature films about everything from an unhinged cop in New Orleans [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1742.98s)]
*  to a guy who thought he could live with grizzly bears. He did until they ate him. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1748.94s)]
*  Werner Herzog has never shied away from the extreme. If anything, he's drawn to it. His [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1753.94s)]
*  movies are often dreamlike explorations of the power of nature, the frailties of man, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1759.18s)]
*  and the edges of sanity. At 82, he's still working constantly, still making movies no [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1764.9s)]
*  one else would or could ever dream of. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1771.06s)]
*  This was the film that introduced Werner Herzog to the world in 1972, Aguirre, the Wrath of [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1778.9s)]
*  God, about a group of conquistadors searching for a lost city of gold in the Amazon and [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1785.02s)]
*  the Wrath, who gradually descend into madness. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1791.02s)]
*  The Wrath of God. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1796.02s)]
*  On a shoestring budget in Peru, it only got finished because of Herzog's force of will [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1799.42s)]
*  and determination. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1804.66s)]
*  I read that you sold your shoes in order to get some fish to feed the crew. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1806.22s)]
*  Well, it's not normally what a director has to do. It's good to have some good boots and [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1810.82s)]
*  you can barter it for a load of fish on my wristwatch. I would give away, I would give [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1816.46s)]
*  away everything. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1822.42s)]
*  And it's worth it? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1823.92s)]
*  Of course. Of course it's worth it. I get away with the loot. I have a film. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1825.32s)]
*  That's the loot, though. You're not talking about making millions and millions of dollars. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1832.12s)]
*  The loot for you is the film. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1836.32s)]
*  Yeah. And of course I make money sometimes and I invest it in the next film. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1838.52s)]
*  If you've seen any of Herzog's documentaries, it may be Grizzly Man, one of his most commercially [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1847.72s)]
*  successful. It tells the strange tale of Timothy Treadwell, an eccentric drifter who spent [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1852.82s)]
*  thirteen summers in the wilds of Alaska recording himself interacting with grizzly bears. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1859.42s)]
*  If I show weakness, I may be hurt, I may be killed. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1865.02s)]
*  Treadwell seemed convinced he had a spiritual connection with the Grizzlies and was somehow [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1868.82s)]
*  their protector. In the end, he's the one who needed protecting. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1873.1200000000001s)]
*  Go back and play. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1877.22s)]
*  We sat down with Herzog to watch the film and others at the Academy Museum of Motion [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1881.12s)]
*  Pictures' David Geffen Theater in Los Angeles. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1885.78s)]
*  And what haunts me is that in all the faces of all the bears that Treadwell ever filmed, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1888.92s)]
*  I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1894.82s)]
*  You have a distinctly unromantic view of nature. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1899.72s)]
*  Yes. Nature is utterly indifferent. We are not made to become brothers with the bears. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1902.12s)]
*  That happens in Walt Disney, not in real life. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1910.02s)]
*  Take a step to the left. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1914.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1916.2199999999998s)]
*  In all of Herzog's feature films and documentaries, you'll find remarkable moments, nightmarish [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1917.02s)]
*  ones as well. His curiosity has taken him to the remotest regions of our planet. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1923.2199999999998s)]

*  With his distinctly Teutonic tone, he narrates his documentaries himself and asks questions [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1932.62s)]
*  that rarely have easy answers. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1939.02s)]
*  Do fish have souls? Do fish have dreams? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1941.32s)]
*  Herzog has revealed hidden landscapes under the Antarctic ice sheet and apocalyptic oil [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1948.92s)]
*  fires in Kuwait after the first Gulf War. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1956.12s)]
*  Has life without fire become unbearable for them? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1960.72s)]
*  He's risked his life to capture the power of volcanoes and filmed ancient cave paintings [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1967.22s)]
*  in France rarely seen before. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1976.38s)]
*  Here, hold it, hold it, hold it. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1978.82s)]
*  Herzog is now working on a new documentary in Los Angeles with his editor Marco Capaldo. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1981.42s)]
*  And now music. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1986.42s)]
*  Wow. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1989.42s)]
*  Schubert's music. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1990.42s)]
*  It's a movie about the search for a legendary herd of elephants in Southern Africa. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1994.42s)]
*  But Herzog insists it's not a wildlife film. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=1999.42s)]
*  It's a fantasy of elephants, maybe a search like for the white whale from Moby Dick. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2003.42s)]
*  It's a dream of an elephant. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2010.42s)]
*  Herzog never had any formal training as a director. He was born in Munich just two weeks [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2014.42s)]
*  before the Allies bombed it in 1942. His father was away serving in the German Army [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2019.42s)]
*  when his mother fled with Werner and his older brother to the mountains of Bavaria. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2024.42s)]
*  We grew up in complete poverty and we had no running water, no sewage system, hardly [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2029.42s)]
*  ever electricity. We had one loaf of bread per week and we were hanging at her skirt [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2035.42s)]
*  wailing that we were hungry and she spins around and she looks at us and she says, boys, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2043.42s)]
*  if I could cut it out of my ribs, I would cut it out of my ribs, but I can't. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2049.42s)]
*  To this day, that experience shapes you. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2054.42s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2057.42s)]
*  Follow me! [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2059.42s)]
*  Herzog didn't see his first film until he was 11. He got hooked on American B-movies [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2060.42s)]
*  like Zorro and decided filmmaking was his destiny. He just needed a camera. He finally [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2066.42s)]
*  found one in a film school in Munich. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2072.42s)]
*  One day I saw this camera room and nobody was in there and I took one and tested it, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2075.42s)]
*  walked out and they never noticed that a camera was missing. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2081.42s)]
*  I mean, that's a stolen camera. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2085.42s)]
*  It was more expropriation than theft. You have to have a certain amount of [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2087.42s)]
*  good criminal energy. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2095.42s)]
*  To make a film. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2098.42s)]
*  Sometimes, yes, you have to go outside of what the norm is. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2099.42s)]
*  16, here! [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2106.42s)]
*  He's been going outside the norm his whole life. In 1979, he began working on a fever [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2108.42s)]
*  dream of a film called Fitzcarraldo. It took him three grueling years to make. German actor [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2114.42s)]
*  Klaus Kinski plays an obsessed Irishman who will stop at nothing to build an opera house [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2122.42s)]
*  in the Amazon. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2128.42s)]
*  I want my opera house! [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2129.42s)]
*  Give it a go! [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2132.42s)]
*  To raise the money for it, Fitzcarraldo hatches a plan to harvest lucrative rubber trees in [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2135.42s)]
*  a remote jungle and hires indigenous laborers to haul a ship over a mountain to do it. Herzog [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2140.42s)]
*  refused to cut corners. He insisted on buying a 340-ton steam ship and actually moving it [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2147.42s)]
*  up a mountain. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2154.42s)]
*  Couldn't you have used special effects with a model of a ship being moved over a mountain [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2156.42s)]
*  rather than actually moving it? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2162.42s)]
*  Yes, that was a discussion with 20th Century Fox and they said we could shoot it in the [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2163.42s)]
*  Botanic Garden in San Diego and we could move a tiny miniature boat and I said, now we are [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2169.42s)]
*  not speaking the same language. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2175.42s)]
*  It certainly would have been easier. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2177.42s)]
*  Now it would have been a lousy film. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2179.42s)]
*  That was the least of it. A border war forced Herzog to move the production a thousand miles [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2181.42s)]
*  away to a new location. There were money problems, plane crashes, fighting between local indigenous [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2187.42s)]
*  groups and constant battles against the rain and mud. Herzog's relentless pursuit of his [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2194.42s)]
*  vision took a toll on the cast and crew and on him as well. Documentary filmmakers shot the [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2200.42s)]
*  chaos behind the scenes and turned it into a movie all its own called Burden of Dreams. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2207.42s)]
*  It's just been re-released in theaters. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2213.42s)]
*  We are challenging nature itself and it hits back. It just hits back, that's all, and that's [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2215.42s)]
*  grandiose about it and we have to accept that it is much stronger than we are. Of course, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2223.42s)]
*  there is a lot of misery that is all around us. The trees here are in misery and the birds [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2229.42s)]
*  are in misery. I don't think they sing, they just screech in pain. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2237.42s)]
*  Did you feel that every day? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2241.42s)]
*  Every day, every night, and the next day, and the next night and on. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2243.42s)]
*  I scream or I don't scream and you don't tell me to scream. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2250.42s)]
*  Herzog also had to deal with Klaus Kinski, the star of the film who was prone to explosions of rage. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2255.42s)]
*  I had a mad man as a leading character. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2261.42s)]
*  He had a temper. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2266.42s)]
*  As demented as it gets, you had to contain him and I made his madness, his explosive destructiveness [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2267.42s)]
*  productive for the screen. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2277.42s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2279.42s)]
*  Every gray hair on my head I call Kinski. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2281.42s)]
*  Kinski appeared in five of Herzog's films and died in 1991, but not before putting his own thoughts [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2285.42s)]
*  about Herzog down on paper. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2293.42s)]
*  This is what Klaus Kinski said of you in his autobiography. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2295.42s)]
*  I've never in my life met anybody so dull, humorless, uptight, and swaggering. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2298.42s)]
*  Herzog is a miserable, hateful, malevolent, avaricious, money-hungry, nasty, sadistic, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2304.42s)]
*  treacherous, cowardly creep. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2310.42s)]
*  Yes, it's beautiful stuff. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2312.42s)]
*  I actually helped him with a dictionary, with Roger E. Thesaurus. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2314.42s)]
*  When Fitzcarraldo was finally released in 1982, Herzog won the Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2323.42s)]
*  You must have been deluded to make this, or crazy in some way. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2329.42s)]
*  No, no, no. But the fact is, when you look at the film industry, there's so much craziness around, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2334.42s)]
*  so much illusion, so much dementia, so much ego. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2341.42s)]
*  And when I look at this, I know I'm the only one who is clinically sane. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2346.42s)]
*  This shows you're the only one who's sane? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2351.42s)]
*  It shows it, yes, yes. That's my proof. Notebooks. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2353.42s)]
*  Herzog still has the journals he wrote while making Fitzcarraldo. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2357.42s)]
*  Over the months, as the pressure on him grew, his writing became barely readable. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2361.42s)]
*  But it becomes microscopic almost. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2366.42s)]
*  He turned those journals into a book called The Conquest of the Useless. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2369.42s)]
*  He's published 11 others as well, fiction, poetry, and memoirs. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2373.42s)]
*  I've always maintained since more than four decades that my writing, my prose, and my poetry will outlive my films. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2377.42s)]
*  You think your writing will outlive your films? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2386.42s)]
*  Yes, I'm totally convinced of that. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2388.42s)]
*  Herzog doesn't just work behind the camera. Every now and then, he acts. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2391.42s)]
*  That's him in the Star Wars series The Mandalorian. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2396.42s)]
*  Please lower your blaster. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2399.42s)]
*  You would do well to remember that life is heartless. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2401.42s)]
*  He's also lent his distinctive voice to several characters on The Simpsons. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2404.42s)]
*  I'd say goodbye, but what's the point? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2408.42s)]
*  I have to know when I'm keeping away from them. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2416.42s)]
*  Last September, we joined Herzog as he taught aspiring filmmakers on the Spanish island of La Palma off the west coast of Africa. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2419.42s)]
*  It's covered in volcanic rock and ash from an eruption three years ago. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2426.42s)]
*  A Herzogian landscape, if ever there was one. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2431.42s)]

*  It's his fantasies. It's his ghosts that he's searching. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2450.42s)]

*  Go out and work as a bouncer in a sex club, work as a warden in a lunatic asylum. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2468.42s)]

*  And I teach them a few things like foraging a shooting permit. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2486.42s)]

*  Have you made those? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2499.42s)]

*  You have to know. Yes, you have to be good at that. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2503.42s)]

*  Now, the last minute of 60 minutes. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2516.42s)]
*  Now an update on a story we reported on last season about how the Social Security Administration recovers money from people it has mistakenly overpaid. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh6ZUpwrvvE&t=2527.42s)]
