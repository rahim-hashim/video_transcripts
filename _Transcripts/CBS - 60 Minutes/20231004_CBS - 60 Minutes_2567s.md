# Attorney General Merrick Garland; The Rise and Fall of Sam Bankman-Fried | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [October 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I)
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland has said little about the Justice Department prosecutions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=0.0s)]
*  of Donald Trump and Hunter Biden. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=12.92s)]
*  Tonight, he tells us about the principles that guide him and how he would deal with [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=15.92s)]
*  political interference. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=22.04s)]
*  As a 60 minutes camera rolled and author Michael Lewis took more notes, former crypto mega [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=23.04s)]
*  billionaire Sam Bankman Fried shuffled cards and jackhammered his legs, avoiding eye contact. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  Today, he's trying to avoid prison. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  You had so much access to Sam Bankman Fried writing this book. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=48.8s)]
*  Ultimately is the purpose here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=52.559999999999995s)]
*  I mean, there's going to be this trial and the lawyers are going to tell two stories. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=54.0s)]
*  And so there's a story war going on in the courtroom. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=58.8s)]
*  And I think neither one of those stories is as good as the story I have. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=61.92s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=67.36s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=68.88s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=70.08s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=71.36s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=72.72s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=74.0s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=75.44s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=76.8s)]
*  Not since Watergate has an attorney general been at the center of such a firestorm. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=82.72s)]
*  Merrick Garland's Justice Department is prosecuting both former President Trump [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=94.64s)]
*  and the son of President Biden. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=99.76s)]
*  Caught in the middle is this 70 year old former prosecutor and well-respected judge [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=102.72s)]
*  with a long history as a moderate. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  We met Garland Friday in Washington. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=111.12s)]
*  He told us that he devoted his life to the rule of law [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  because of his family's struggle to escape the Holocaust. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=118.08s)]
*  Now he's responsible for prosecutions that will shape the future of the nation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  In a rare interview, the attorney general told us that in the Trump and Biden trials ahead, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=128.16s)]
*  his prosecutors will pursue justice without fear and without favor. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  We do not have one rule for Republicans and another rule for Democrats. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=141.44s)]
*  We don't have one rule for foes and another for friends. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=145.92s)]
*  We don't have one rule for powerful and another for the powerless, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=149.6s)]
*  for the rich or for the poor based on ethnicity. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  We have only one rule and that one rule is that we follow the facts and the law [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=155.44s)]
*  and we reach the decisions required by the Constitution and we protect civil liberties. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  Are you essentially saying as attorney general to the American people, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=165.12s)]
*  trust me? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=169.36s)]
*  Well, in the end, I suppose it does in the end come down to trust, but it's not just me. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=170.96s)]
*  It's decades of the norms of this department that are part of the DNA of the career prosecutors [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  who are running the investigation and supervising the investigations that you're talking about. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  Former President Trump faces two federal trials, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=189.44s)]
*  one for allegedly hoarding classified documents and covering it up. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=193.44s)]
*  The other for allegedly conspiring to seize power after the 2020 election. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=197.84s)]
*  Attorney General Garland has said little about this and we wanted to understand why. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=203.84s)]
*  Well, I think the first thing to understand is because these are pending cases, because there [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=210.56s)]
*  are two federal indictments, the long-standing rule in the Justice Department is that we can't [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  comment about pending cases. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=219.84s)]
*  Where does that rule come from? What's the point? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=221.68s)]
*  One reason is to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the person who's under investigation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=224.0s)]
*  It's to protect witnesses who also may or may not become public leader in an investigation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=229.92s)]
*  And then finally, it's to protect the investigation itself. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=236.08s)]
*  Investigations proceed in many different directions, eventually coming to a fruition, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=239.92s)]
*  a decision to charge or not charge about a particular thing or not. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=245.2s)]
*  And if witnesses and potential subjects knew everything that the investigators had previously [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  looked at and were about to look at, it could well change testimony. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=255.12s)]
*  It could well make witnesses unavailable to us. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=259.92s)]
*  And this is not peculiar to the Trump investigations. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=262.88s)]
*  This is a rule for all investigations. This is part of what we call our justice manual. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=265.92s)]
*  It's been there for probably at least 30 years and probably looked longer than that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  Help us understand the timing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=275.2s)]
*  These prosecutions of the former president are happening during the campaign. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=278.56s)]
*  You could make the argument that it's the worst possible time. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=283.28s)]
*  The Justice Department has general practices about not making significant overt steps or charging [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  within a month or so of an election. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=295.44s)]
*  We are clearly outside that time frame in these cases. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  Prosecutors, special counsel, they follow the facts and the law where they lead. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  When they've gotten the amount of evidence necessary to make a charging decision and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  have decided that a charge is warranted, that's when they bring their cases. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=315.6s)]
*  The investigation itself has determined the timing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=319.6s)]
*  Yes, exactly right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=323.6s)]
*  Your critics say that it's time to ruin Mr. Trump's chances in the election. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=324.8s)]
*  Well, that's absolutely not true. Justice Department prosecutors are nonpartisan. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=330.4s)]
*  They don't allow partisan considerations to play any role in their determinations. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=336.08s)]
*  The prosecutor in the Trump cases is Jack Smith. He was named by Garland to be special counsel. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=340.56s)]
*  That's a job under the regulations of the Justice Department designed to give Smith broad [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  independence from the Department and from the White House. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  The most important aspect of the regulations is that the special counsel is not subject [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=358.56s)]
*  to the day-to-day supervision of anyone in the Justice Department. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=364.48s)]
*  You are not in communication with the President or any member of his administration [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=368.72s)]
*  with regard to the investigation of former President Trump. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=374.0s)]
*  No, I am not. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  If President Biden asked you to take action with regard to the Trump investigation, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=378.32s)]
*  what would your reaction be? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=385.84s)]
*  I am sure that that will not happen, but I would not do anything in that regard. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=387.76s)]
*  And if necessary, I would resign. But there is no sense that anything like that will happen. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  Have you ever had to tell him hands off these investigations, Mr. President? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=400.32s)]
*  No, because he has never tried to put hands on these investigations. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=405.12s)]
*  Separately, President Biden himself is the subject of a special counsel investigation [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=409.28s)]
*  into whether he improperly held classified documents after he was vice president. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=415.52s)]
*  His son, Hunter Biden, is the target of a four-year investigation into his business deals [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=421.84s)]
*  and his taxes. He's been indicted for lying about drug abuse when he bought a gun. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=429.2s)]
*  Republicans accuse special counsel David Weiss of slow-walking the Hunter Biden investigation. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=436.24s)]
*  The allegation is, Mr. Attorney General, that what is described in some quarters as the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=444.24s)]
*  Biden Justice Department is taking it easy on the president's son. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=452.56s)]
*  Well, look, this investigation began under David Weiss. David Weiss is a long-standing [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  career prosecutor, and he was appointed by Mr. Trump as the United States attorney [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=465.52s)]
*  for the District of Delaware. I promised at my nomination hearing that I would continue him on [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=471.68s)]
*  in that position and that I would not interfere with this investigation. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=477.04s)]
*  You are not participating in those decisions? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=481.44s)]
*  No, Mr. Weiss is making those decisions. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=484.24s)]
*  The White House is not attempting to influence those decisions? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=486.4s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=489.6s)]
*  And he said we won't have to take his word for it. Under Justice Department regulations, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=491.12s)]
*  a special counsel must write a final report. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=497.28s)]
*  Which I will make public to the extent permissible under the law. That isn't required [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=501.44s)]
*  to explain their prosecuted decisions, their decisions to prosecute or not prosecute, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=508.23999999999995s)]
*  and their strategic decisions along the way. Usually the special councils have testified [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=513.68s)]
*  at the end of their reports, and I expect that that will be the case here. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=518.8s)]
*  How's your relationship with the president? It must be frosty. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=522.24s)]
*  I have a good working relationship with the president. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=526.96s)]
*  Good, perhaps, but maybe not close. The president addressed the question in August [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=530.08s)]
*  when he spotted Garland at a White House event. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=536.48s)]
*  Attorney General Garland, haven't seen you in a long while. Good to see you. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=539.28s)]
*  Secretary of Homeland, you think I'm kidding or not? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=543.44s)]
*  Attorney General Garland leads 115,000 employees, prosecutors, agents of the FBI, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=545.44s)]
*  and other federal law enforcement. Additional security is now assigned to protect judges [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=558.8800000000001s)]
*  and prosecutors after the Trump cases drew death threats. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=564.8800000000001s)]
*  Political violence is among Garland's gravest concerns. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=569.9200000000001s)]
*  People can argue with each other as much as they want and as vociferously as they want, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=574.88s)]
*  but the one thing they may not do is use violence and threats of violence to alter the outcome. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=581.28s)]
*  An important aspect of this is the American people themselves. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=586.88s)]
*  The American people must protect each other. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=590.56s)]

*  argue as vociferously as they want, but refrain from violence and threats of violence. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=607.12s)]
*  That's the only way this democracy will survive. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=612.08s)]
*  Why do you feel so strongly about that? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=614.72s)]
*  Well, I feel it for a number of reasons and a number of things that I've seen, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=618.0s)]
*  but for my own family who fled religious persecution in Europe and some members who did not [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=622.4799999999999s)]
*  survive when they got to the United States. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=635.8399999999999s)]
*  The United States protected. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=641.76s)]
*  I. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=642.96s)]
*  It guaranteed that they could practice their religion, that they could vote, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=646.8000000000001s)]
*  they could do all the things they thought a democracy would provide. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=652.72s)]
*  That's the difference between this country and many other countries. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=657.2800000000001s)]
*  It's my responsibility, it's the Justice Department's responsibility, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=662.0s)]
*  to ensure that that difference continues, that we protect each other. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=665.52s)]
*  Two of your ancestors were murdered in the Holocaust. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=669.3599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=676.9599999999999s)]
*  Is that why you devoted yourself to the law? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=677.92s)]
*  Yes, I would say that's why I devoted myself to the rule of law, to public service, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=681.4399999999999s)]
*  to trying and to ensure that the rule of law governs this country and continues to govern this country. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=688.4799999999999s)]
*  Merrick Garland has spent a life in the law. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=695.5200000000001s)]
*  M-E-R-R-I-C-K, G-A-R-L-A-N-D, he's the Associate Deputy Attorney General. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=698.8800000000001s)]
*  At Justice, he oversaw the Oklahoma City bombing case, an act of political terrorism. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=705.12s)]
*  Later, after nearly two decades as a federal appeals court judge, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=711.36s)]
*  he was nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Obama. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=715.6s)]
*  But Republicans stalled the nomination for 10 months until Donald Trump was sworn in. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=720.0s)]
*  President-elect Biden picked Garland for Attorney General on the same day the Capitol was attacked. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=727.2s)]
*  That became one of the largest investigations in the Department's history. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=735.28s)]
*  We've arrested and brought charges against more than 1,100 people. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=740.72s)]
*  There are more to come. The videos that every single person happened to have on their phones, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=746.4s)]
*  that security cameras had, that bystanders had, that media had at the time, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=752.08s)]
*  disclosed faces, some of which we have not yet been able to connect to people. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=757.28s)]
*  You're looking for new suspects, new defendants still. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=762.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's not that they're new suspects, but they are people that we haven't found yet. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=765.04s)]
*  Why do these prosecutions mean so much to you? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=769.28s)]
*  Because this is a fundamental aspect of our democracy. If we can't ensure that this kind of [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=772.96s)]
*  behavior doesn't recur, it will occur. The prosecutions we bring are deterrence against [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=779.0400000000001s)]
*  that from happening. Garland knows he will be vilified no matter how the Trump and Biden [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=785.6s)]
*  cases are decided. His job, he told us, was to take the arrows for the Department. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=790.64s)]
*  He has learned to embrace the pain that comes with the job. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=796.96s)]
*  The youngest right now is Riot Mitchell, forever eight months old. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=804.72s)]
*  And we saw that at DEA headquarters where he was surrounded by those lost to the opioid epidemic [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=808.72s)]
*  and their grieving families. Meeting them, he told us, reminds him of why he fights [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=818.64s)]
*  and whom he is fighting for. Thank you for being here and listening to us. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=825.2s)]
*  I represent the American people. I don't represent the president. I represent the American people. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=829.84s)]
*  And likewise, I am not Congress's prosecutor. I work for the American people. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=836.1600000000001s)]
*  And if democracy is an emotional subject for Merrick Garland, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=842.96s)]
*  maybe it's because he has witnessed how suddenly it can be threatened. In Oklahoma City, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=848.08s)]
*  and Washington, D.C. When the history of this extraordinary time is written, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=855.2s)]
*  what is the best that Merrick Garland can hope for? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=862.1600000000001s)]
*  Look, I think it's the best any public servant can hope for, that we've done our best, that we pass [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=866.8000000000001s)]
*  on a Justice Department that continues to pursue the rule of law and protect it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=872.88s)]
*  And it's the same thing that every generation has to hope. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=879.9200000000001s)]
*  That we can pass our democracy on in working order to the next generation that picks up the torch [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=883.6s)]
*  and is responsible when we're finished to continue that job. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=892.48s)]
*  Michael Lewis has made a literary career finding jump-off-the-page characters and using them to [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=905.84s)]
*  help tell complicated stories. And what could be more complicated than explaining cryptocurrency? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=912.4000000000001s)]
*  Lewis gained all hours access to Sam Bankman Fried, known for a time as the J.P. Morgan of [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=918.96s)]
*  crypto. His sector, as ungoverned as his hair, Bankman Fried was worth more than $20 billion [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=924.4000000000001s)]
*  before he turned 30. An unlikely celebrity, his life braided finance, politics, sports, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=930.4000000000001s)]
*  and pop culture. Then the empire crumbled, and today Bankman Fried sits in jail on various [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=936.8000000000001s)]
*  federal charges and faces potential sentences of more than 100 years. Lewis, though, didn't [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=942.88s)]
*  panic sell. He simply went where the story took him. His latest book, Going Infinite, comes out [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  Tuesday, which is also the opening day in the trial of Sam Bankman Fried. You had so much access [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=954.32s)]
*  to Sam Bankman Fried writing this book. What ultimately is the purpose here? I realized I [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=962.0s)]
*  had an ambition for the book. I saw it as a kind of letter to the jury. I mean, there's going to be [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=968.08s)]
*  this trial and the lawyers are going to tell two stories. And so there's a story war going on in [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=971.92s)]
*  the courtroom. And I think neither one of those stories is as good as the story I have. Michael [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=978.24s)]
*  Lewis didn't set out to write this book. Two autumns ago, he was at home in the Bay Area when [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=983.28s)]
*  he got a call from a friend interested in investing with a young billionaire. Could Lewis meet with [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=988.24s)]
*  this wunderkind and size him up? So it was Lewis brought Sam Bankman Fried here in the Berkeley [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=994.16s)]
*  Hills for a hike in the park. You got to remember, I knew nothing about him. All I knew was I was [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1000.32s)]
*  supposed to evaluate his character and that 18 months earlier he had nothing. Now he had 22 and [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1005.44s)]
*  a half billion dollars and was the richest person in the world under 30. He cared much about like [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1011.6800000000001s)]
*  spending it on yachts. He was going to spend it to save humanity from extinction kind of thing. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1016.08s)]
*  So the whole walk was like my jaw was on the floor by here after I heard all that. As an author whose [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1020.48s)]
*  stock and trade is finding interesting characters, is your story meter starting to beep about now? I [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1027.6000000000001s)]
*  was on a red alert and I said this to him. I said, I don't know what's going to happen to you. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1033.04s)]
*  Something's going to happen to you. Can I just come and, you know, ride shotgun? Now riding shotgun [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1037.76s)]
*  ended up being like hanging on for dear life to, you know, an automobile that's going 270 miles an [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1042.96s)]
*  hour and taking every hairpin turn. My instinct was we should very slowly be trickling out [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1048.72s)]
*  these positions. Sam Bankman Fried and Lewis would end up meeting more than a hundred times over two [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1054.32s)]
*  years, speaking for countless hours. As our camera rolled in July, note how Bankman Fried shuffled [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1060.56s)]
*  cards and Jack hammered his legs and avoided eye contact. Lewis considers Bankman Fried the most [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1067.12s)]
*  challenging and fascinating character he's ever encountered. This from an author who's been writing [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1073.6799999999998s)]
*  non-fiction since the 80s. I want to talk about that guy. The story of Sam's life is people not [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1079.36s)]
*  understanding him, misreading him. He's so different. He's so unusual. I mean, I think in a funny way [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1085.6799999999998s)]
*  the reason I have such a compelling story is I have a character that I do come to know and that [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1091.76s)]
*  the reader comes to know that the world still doesn't know. Sorry, some Japanese again. A graduate of MIT, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1097.6799999999998s)]
*  Bankman Fried saw the world in numbers, framing everything in his life as a probability exercise, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1104.2399999999998s)]
*  including philanthropy. He committed to making as much money as possible so he could give it away as [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1110.1599999999999s)]
*  efficiently as possible, guided by a social movement, effective altruism. What it means in Sam's [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1117.04s)]
*  instance is you can go out and have a career where you do good. You can go be a doctor in Africa or [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1123.68s)]
*  you can go out and make as much money as possible and pay people to be doctors in Africa. If you're [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1130.0s)]
*  a doctor in Africa, you get, you end up saving a certain number of lives, but you're only one doctor. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1134.56s)]
*  But if you can pay 40 people to become doctors in Africa, you're going to save 40 times the [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1139.2s)]
*  number of lives. This is like a strategy game. Well, you don't understand Sam Bankman Fried unless [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1145.52s)]
*  you understand that he turns everything into a game. Everything is gamified. Bankman Fried worked [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1149.76s)]
*  as a Wall Street trader before moving to Berkeley at age 25 to start his own trading firm, Alameda [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1154.96s)]
*  Research. Instead of buying and selling stocks or bonds, he would traffic in crypto, a digital form [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1161.04s)]
*  of currency not tied to a centralized system. The basic idea was to be the smartest person in the [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1167.84s)]
*  crypto markets, to be the one who did the kind of trading in crypto that the smartest Wall Street [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1173.76s)]
*  traders did in stocks. So these quant skills he had as a trader on regular stocks and equities [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1178.32s)]
*  markets, he was going to bring to this new ascending crypto world? Correct. What's the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1183.44s)]
*  difference between crypto finance and traditional finance? Well, the promise of crypto finance is [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1188.16s)]
*  the promise of an absence of intermediaries. If I want to wire you $10,000, a bank has to do it. A [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1193.12s)]
*  bank records the transaction. A bank takes some little slice of it. If I want to wire you $10,000 [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1198.96s)]
*  worth of Bitcoin, I can just hit a button and you get it. So you remove the institutions. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1204.0s)]
*  Coming out of the 2008 financial crisis, crypto took hold as an anti-establishment punk rock version [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1209.52s)]
*  of a financial system, which Lewis finds ironic. In the beginning, especially, it's a crowd of [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1215.8400000000001s)]
*  people who are incredibly mistrustful of institutions. What attracts them to it is they hate the government, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1222.16s)]
*  they hate banks, but then they somehow this pool of incredibly mistrustful people [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1227.92s)]
*  proceed to trust each other in ways that I wouldn't trust you. They're parking their money [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1234.16s)]
*  in a sector that's unregulated. There are no physical properties, provably squirrely and [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1238.72s)]
*  unreliable over and over, but it's predicated on trust. They are Charlie Brown kicking the [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1243.68s)]
*  football that they're sure that this time Lucy's going to hold it. Still, Bankman Fried made a [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1248.72s)]
*  fortune at Alameda research and then he really got rich. Instead of simply trading, Bankman [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1254.8s)]
*  Fried seized on the idea of opening his own cryptocurrency exchange. One of the things he [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1261.2s)]
*  notices is that all the crypto exchanges are screwed up in one way or another. There are [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1266.32s)]
*  dozens of these places where you can trade crypto, but they're not structured for a professional [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1271.52s)]
*  trader. The technology is bad, they'll lose their customers' money. It's the Wild West. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1276.8s)]
*  He realizes that if you built a better exchange, he wanted to build an exchange he could trade on, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1282.24s)]
*  so he creates FTX. Once he created it, it went boom. When it went boom, he realized that, well, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1288.08s)]
*  that's the gold mine. It actually isn't trading the crypto. This is owning the casino, right? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1297.04s)]
*  It's owning the casino. He started as a gambler and he realized that building the better casino [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1301.2s)]
*  was actually going to be more valuable. FTX has seen explosive growth. Soon, roughly $15 billion [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1306.0800000000002s)]
*  a day in trades were executed on his new exchange, FTX. If you're sitting in the middle of those [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1312.24s)]
*  transactions and you're taking out even a tiny fraction of a percentage point, there's a lot of [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1318.16s)]
*  money to be made. Indifferent to the outcome of the trade. You're taking no risk. You're taking no [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1322.72s)]
*  risk at all. It didn't matter to him whether crypto went up or crypto went down. As long as people [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1326.88s)]
*  are trading crypto, it made money. It's the best business. I had one venture capitalist tell me, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1330.88s)]
*  several venture capitalists thought that Sam might be the world's first trillionaire. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1336.88s)]
*  They're looking for the next Google. They're looking for the next Apple. They thought FTX [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1341.2s)]
*  had that kind of possibility, that it had a chance to be the single most important [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1345.76s)]
*  financial institution in the world. As he began accumulating billions as if they were Pokemon [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1349.68s)]
*  cards, Bankman Freed began attracting something else he wasn't accustomed to. There's a lot of [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1355.68s)]
*  leveraging cryptocurrency markets. He changed not at all. He'd never been on TV. He goes on TV in [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1360.72s)]
*  his cargo shorts and his messy hair and he's playing video games while he's on the air. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1366.72s)]
*  He's playing video games on the air. You would think your first television appearance, you might [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1370.88s)]
*  be a little uptight, a little nervous. And if you watch the clip, you can see his eyes going back [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1374.72s)]
*  and forth and forth. This is because he's trying to win his video game. At the same time, he's on [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1379.44s)]
*  the air. Whether it was his smarts, his fierce indifference to appearance or simply his vast wealth, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1382.48s)]
*  the beautiful people suddenly found him irresistible. As his net worth goes up, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1388.72s)]
*  so does his social capital. You write about a Zoom meeting you walked in on. He says, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1393.44s)]
*  I got to go do a Zoom. I said, what is it? And he says, there's this person named Anna Wintour. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1398.24s)]
*  And he didn't know who she was. He had no idea who she was. No. So I sat off to one side where [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1403.76s)]
*  she couldn't see me and I watched this Zoom. Now, your thing, what does Anna Wintour want to do with [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1409.04s)]
*  a schlub like Sam? Exactly. He is the worst dressed person in America. He is the worst [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1413.52s)]
*  dressed billionaire in the history of billionaires. What she wants him to do is to sponsor the Met Gala, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1419.04s)]
*  her great ball that she throws every year, which is all about dress and appearances. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1426.16s)]
*  Sam was a social experiment. He is a person who has nothing, all of a sudden has [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1431.52s)]
*  seemingly infinite dollars, will give it away, is unbelievably open-handed about it, and doesn't [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1436.4s)]
*  ask a whole lot of questions. What that attracts, who shows up when this person exists? Everybody. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1442.24s)]
*  Everyone comes to the trough. Everybody comes to the trough. Everybody wants to be his best friend. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1448.08s)]
*  FTX is the safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1452.4s)]
*  Bankman Fried wanted it known that FTX was the go-to player in crypto. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1455.28s)]
*  Hey, it's Shaquille O'Neal and I'm excited to be partnering with FTX. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1459.84s)]
*  He turned to the sports world to bring his exchange both legitimacy and edge. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1463.2s)]
*  Lewis saw the FTX internal marketing documents. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1468.32s)]
*  He paid Tom Brady $55 million for 20 hours a year for three years. He paid Steph Curry $35 million [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1471.6799999999998s)]
*  same thing for three years. Pretty good hourly wage. He spent a hundred and something million [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1479.12s)]
*  dollars buying the naming rights for the Miami Heat Arena. I don't think so. He spent $25 million [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1482.9599999999998s)]
*  making a Super Bowl ad with Larry David. It's FTX? I don't think so. For which he then paid [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1488.7199999999998s)]
*  Larry David another $10 million. It's breathtaking what's on that list. Did any of the people [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1494.08s)]
*  surrounding him, these celebrities, do it because they found him interesting or was it all because [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1498.56s)]
*  he's worth $27 billion? It's probably not fair for me to speak for them but I will speak for them. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1503.12s)]
*  Tom Brady I think adored him. I think Tom Brady thought he was just a really interesting person. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1510.24s)]
*  I think he'd like to hear what he had to say. What's up guys? I'm here with my boy Sam from FTX. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1515.52s)]
*  And he really liked Tom Brady and Sam wasn't like a big sports person. So it was funny to watch that [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1520.24s)]
*  interaction. It was like these two people actually get along. It's like the class nerd and the [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1525.68s)]
*  quarterback. The two high school tribes. The nerd of all nerds. Like even the nerds don't hang out [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1530.24s)]
*  with this nerd. He's such a nerd. The quarterback somehow likes him and he somehow likes the [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1535.28s)]
*  quarterback. Lewis writes in his book that Bankman Freed's philanthropic ambitions kept pace with [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1540.16s)]
*  his wealth. Never mind doctors in Africa, he set out to confront what he saw as existential [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1546.48s)]
*  threats to all of humanity. Sam Bankman Freed ends up with a portfolio heavily concentrated in two [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1552.4s)]
*  things. Pandemic prevention because there really are things the government should be doing and [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1558.72s)]
*  the other thing that made his list that was so interesting was Donald Trump. He took the view [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1563.68s)]
*  that all the big existential problems are going to require the United States government to be [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1568.16s)]
*  involved to solve them. And if the democracy is undermined, like we don't have our democracy [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1574.0s)]
*  anymore, all these problems are less likely to be solved. And he saw Trump trying to undermine the [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1579.76s)]
*  democracy and he thought Trump belongs on the list of existential risks. To that end, Lewis writes [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1584.8s)]
*  that in 2022 Bankman Freed met with the most unlikely of allies, Republican Senate minority [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1591.44s)]
*  leader Mitch McConnell. You're flying with Sam and he tells you about a meeting he's going to have [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1597.36s)]
*  with Mitch McConnell. Well the interesting thing starts before we even get on the plane. I meet [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1601.76s)]
*  him at the airport and he comes tumbling out of a car and he's in his cargo shorts and his t-shirt [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1605.12s)]
*  and he's got balled up in his hand. It takes me a while to see what it is but it's a blue suit. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1610.0s)]
*  It's got more wrinkles than any blue suit ever had. It's like it's been it's just jammed in his [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1614.96s)]
*  little ball and a shoe like falls out of the pile and he's got in his arms and I say like what why [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1618.64s)]
*  you have the suit? He says Mitch McConnell really cares what you wear when you meet with him and [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1624.64s)]
*  he's having dinner in six hours with Mitch McConnell and I say well you got the suit is there [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1630.72s)]
*  you got belt? He goes no I don't have a belt. I said you got you have a shirt? He goes no no shirt [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1636.24s)]
*  and the suit you really can't really wear that suit and he goes yeah but they told me to bring a [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1640.88s)]
*  suit. According to Lewis, Bankman Freed wanted to help McConnell fund Republican candidates at odds [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1645.76s)]
*  with Donald Trump. What is the subtext of this dinner is Sam is going to write tens of millions [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1652.56s)]
*  of dollars a check to Super PAC that Mitch McConnell is then going to use to get elected [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1658.24s)]
*  people who are not hostile to democracy. Wait so Mitch McConnell has a list of Republican candidates [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1664.16s)]
*  who are sort of on the playing field for democracy versus what he deemed outside. He and his people [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1670.08s)]
*  had done the work to distinguish between actual deep Trumpers and people who were just seeming to [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1675.04s)]
*  to approve of Donald Trump but were actually willing to govern. Bankman Freed ended up giving [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1681.1200000000001s)]
*  multi-millions in support of Republican candidates. Back in 2020 Bankman Freed had [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1686.0s)]
*  ranked among Joe Biden's biggest donors. As 2024 approached he planned on spending more [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1691.52s)]
*  albeit in the most unconventional way. One of the most shocking passages in this book I thought [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1698.08s)]
*  came with this revelation that Sam had looked into paying Donald Trump not to run. That only [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1703.6s)]
*  shocks you if you don't know Sam. Sam's thinking we could pay Donald Trump not to run for president [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1709.44s)]
*  like how much would it take? Did he get an answer? So he did get an answer. He was floated there was [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1716.16s)]
*  a number that was kicking around and the number was kicking around when I was talking to Sam about [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1720.72s)]
*  this was five billion dollars. Sam was not sure that number came directly from Trump. Wait wait [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1724.0800000000002s)]
*  so Sam's looking into paying Trump not to run and he actually get didn't mean to come from Trump [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1728.48s)]
*  himself but he actually got a price? He got one answer yes. The question Sam had was not just is [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1733.92s)]
*  five billion dollars enough to pay Trump not to run but was it legal? Well why didn't this happen? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1741.8400000000001s)]
*  Why didn't you follow through? Well they were still having these conversations when FTX blew up [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1748.0s)]
*  so why didn't happen? He didn't have five billion dollars anymore. Approached for comment by 60 [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1752.5600000000002s)]
*  minutes neither former President Trump nor Senator McConnell responded. Last November in a matter of [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1758.0s)]
*  days mega billionaire Sam Bankman Fried lost virtually everything and he soon faced an onslaught [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1764.4s)]
*  of federal fraud charges. When we return the fall of Sam Bankman Fried. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1770.64s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1775.84s)]
*  Meteoric as the rise of Sam Bankman Fried was the fall came faster still. In a span of days a [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1787.52s)]
*  celebrity multi-billionaire became a pariah. His wealth largely evaporated as federal prosecutors [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1793.6s)]
*  mounted a case against him. In his new book out this week Michael Lewis details the crash and [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1799.92s)]
*  leaves it to readers to decide if Sam Bankman Fried was a cryptocurrency con man in cargo shorts [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1806.16s)]
*  or a really smart guy singularly ill-equipped to run and manage a business. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1812.64s)]
*  By spring of 2022 Sam Bankman Fried had planted his flag in the Bahamas. He decided to move his [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1820.0s)]
*  high-flying cryptocurrency exchange FTX to the islands not for the beaches but for the friendly [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1826.08s)]
*  regulatory climate. With the Prime Minister on hand they put shovels in the ground for a new [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1832.24s)]
*  headquarters. Bankman Fried openly discussed paying off the country's nine billion dollar national debt. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1837.6799999999998s)]
*  By this point Michael Lewis and Bankman Fried had a dynamic that went beyond author subject. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1844.48s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried He started using me as a sounding board. For what? For just like decisions he was making. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1849.6799999999998s)]
*  Should I join Elon Musk in buying Twitter? You know should we do this? Should we do that? What'd [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1854.16s)]
*  you tell him? Mostly my answers were no, no, and no and he would look at me and say you're a boring [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1859.8400000000001s)]
*  grown-up. And Bankman Fried, now 31, told Lewis, now 62, that anyone older than 45 was useless. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1864.88s)]
*  But Lewis noted that if ever there were a corporate leader in need of adult input to manage 400 [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1873.92s)]
*  employees it was Sam Bankman Fried. What kind of a manager was he? Horrible. I mean even his best [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1879.76s)]
*  friends inside the company said Sam is just not built to manage people. Had Sam managed anything [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1886.16s)]
*  before? His sole experience of leadership was running puzzle hunts for math nerds at high school [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1892.56s)]
*  and actually thought deep down if you asked him people shouldn't need to be managed so he proceeded [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1899.52s)]
*  to act on that and basically didn't manage them. Is there any checks and balances happening in this [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1905.84s)]
*  environment then? Well what checks and balances would you imagine there might be in a corporation? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1910.8s)]
*  Chief Financial Officer? No there's no Chief Financial Officer. HR department? No there was no [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1916.0s)]
*  HR department. Compliance office? Oh no, no there was no board of directors or rather I asked Sam [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1920.32s)]
*  I said who's your board of directors and he said we don't really have one. I said what do you mean [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1926.56s)]
*  don't have one? Everyone has one. He says there are two other people on something called a board [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1930.8799999999999s)]
*  of directors but it's changed and I don't even know their names and their job is just a docusign. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1934.56s)]
*  He didn't know the name of the board of directors. No he didn't know who was on it. So he's running [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1939.12s)]
*  this like a lemonade stand and he's doing enough volume of business this could be a public traded [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1942.3999999999999s)]
*  company if you wanted to. Oh if it was a publicly traded company it would be a publicly traded company [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1947.44s)]
*  worth 40 billion dollars. No it was all Sam's world and there was nobody there to say like don't [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1951.12s)]
*  don't do that. FTX purchased a 30 million dollar executive penthouse in a Bahamas resort [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1958.56s)]
*  flush with an exclusive marina. It was lost on Sam who worked feverishly in the office and slept on [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1964.88s)]
*  a beanbag chair. But there was another reason he avoided the Luxe penthouse. His girlfriend Caroline [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1971.3600000000001s)]
*  Ellison, a former Wall Street trader herself, had kicked him out. Compounding matters he had put her [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1977.76s)]
*  in charge of running Alameda Research, Bankman Freed's privately held trading firm. So the romance [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1984.32s)]
*  between Sam and Caroline go sideways. How does that impact what happens to FTX and Alameda Research? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1990.6399999999999s)]
*  Coincidentally the romance more than go sideways. They have a falling out where they're basically [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=1997.36s)]
*  not speaking to each other. She's not speaking to him at precisely the time crypto collapses. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2000.8799999999999s)]
*  Explain why that's a problem. It's a problem because Alameda Research is one of the traders [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2006.48s)]
*  on FTX. Translation, though Bankman Freed owned the FTX exchange, he was also trading crypto on FTX [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2013.12s)]
*  through his other business Alameda Research. And he was gambling in his own casino and it created [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2022.0s)]
*  conflicts of interest. So he owns the casino but he's still gambling. Yes he didn't stop gambling. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2029.28s)]
*  Crypto is destabilized. The value of crypto had been eroding throughout the summer of 2022. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2033.84s)]
*  Then came a one-two punch. A leak of Alameda's unflattering balance sheet in early November. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2040.56s)]
*  And days later, Cheng Pengzhao, head of a rival exchange, took to Twitter to question FTX's [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2046.8799999999999s)]
*  viability. This triggered a classic panic run, digital style, on FTX. How fast was money flowing [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2052.88s)]
*  out of FTX? In the run, you know, a billion dollars a day was leaving. A billion dollars a day this [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2060.56s)]
*  thing's gushing. Yeah it unravels because the depositors at FTX want their money back and it's [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2066.0s)]
*  not all there. It wasn't all there in large part because the investors' money intended for FTX had [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2070.8s)]
*  wound up in Bankman Freed's privately held fund, Alameda Research. More than eight billion dollars. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2077.52s)]
*  Do you think he knowingly stole customers' money, Sam? Put that way, no. So there's another side of [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2084.64s)]
*  this. In the very beginning, if you were a crypto trader who wanted to trade on FTX and wanted to [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2091.44s)]
*  send dollars or yen or euros onto the exchange so you could buy crypto, FTX couldn't get bank [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2097.2000000000003s)]
*  accounts. So Alameda Research, which could get bank accounts, created bank accounts for people to send [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2105.28s)]
*  money into so that it would go to FTX. But it was held in Alameda Research, Alameda Research bank [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2111.36s)]
*  accounts, and eight billion something dollars piles up inside of Alameda Research that belongs [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2117.76s)]
*  to FTX customers that never gets moved. It never gets transferred over. Never gets transferred. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2124.7200000000003s)]
*  That sounds like a problem. It's a huge problem. What's the toughest question you think Sam's going [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2130.0800000000004s)]
*  to have to answer? How do you not know that eight billion dollars that's not yours is in your private [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2134.4s)]
*  fund? I mean really, how do you not know? Explain. Eight billion dollars is in your private fund that [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2140.1600000000003s)]
*  belongs to other people and you're saying you didn't know. Please explain how that's possible. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2146.24s)]
*  Did you do that? Yeah, I did. What'd he say? He said you have to understand that when it went in [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2150.16s)]
*  there it was a rounding error, that I felt like we had infinity dollars in there, that I wasn't even [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2153.68s)]
*  thinking about it. I could see people watching this saying like, come on guys, this is Elizabeth Holmes [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2157.68s)]
*  in cargo shorts and this is all a ruse. Don't fall for this shtick. This is a bad actor. It is a little [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2161.6s)]
*  different supplying phony medical information to people that might kill them. And in this case, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2166.56s)]
*  what you're doing is possibly losing some money that belonged to crypto speculators in the Bahamas. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2171.92s)]
*  On the other hand, this is not to excuse. He shouldn't have done that. Early in the morning of [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2178.2400000000002s)]
*  November 11th, Sam Bankman Fried reluctantly docu-signed FTX into bankruptcy. It had taken [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2183.52s)]
*  five days for FTX to implode. You go back to the Bahamas as Pompeii is falling. What did you see [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2190.32s)]
*  when you landed? I got back the day on the Friday of the collapse. It was the afternoon that Sam had [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2197.52s)]
*  signed the bankruptcy papers and by then they'd been a mass exodus. Most of the employees had fled [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2203.92s)]
*  and fled in such a way that, kind of a ridiculous way, they'd taken the company cars and ditched [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2211.04s)]
*  them at the airport with the keys inside. Or they were going to get the hell out. Nobody knew what [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2215.84s)]
*  had happened, but they were just scared that they were going to be detained by the local authorities. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2219.2s)]
*  We drove into the lot and Sam Bankman Fried is walking loops around the parking lot. He'd been [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2224.32s)]
*  brought over there earlier to be interviewed by Bahamas authorities and nobody gave him a ride [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2230.96s)]
*  home and he was just sitting there all alone. How do you divorce Michael Lewis, the empathetic human [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2236.32s)]
*  being from Michael Lewis, the journalist and author who recognizes what a third act is? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2242.1600000000003s)]
*  Pretty dramatic, right? If I were a better person, I would have been deeply distressed by all of this. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2247.44s)]
*  It took about a nanosecond before I thought, oh my god, this is an incredible story. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2255.84s)]
*  A month later, Bankman Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to New York to face [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2260.6400000000003s)]
*  federal charges that he had fraudulently used customer deposits to finance billions of dollars [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2265.36s)]
*  of venture capital investments, real estate purchases and political donations. What's your [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2271.04s)]
*  response to someone who hears us and says it's a fun story and it's crypto in the Bahamas, but this [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2276.8s)]
*  is the oldest architecture of a financial collapse that's been going on for centuries? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2281.76s)]
*  This isn't a Ponzi scheme. When you think of a Ponzi scheme, I don't know, Bernie Madoff, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2286.5600000000004s)]
*  the problem is there's no real business there. The dollar coming in is being used to pay the dollar [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2291.2000000000003s)]
*  going out and in this case, they actually had a great real business. If no one had ever cast [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2297.04s)]
*  dispersions on the business, if there hadn't been a run on customer deposits, they'd still be sitting [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2303.84s)]
*  there making tons of money. Inside the Beltway, in the Hollywood Hills and in sports arenas, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2308.4s)]
*  suddenly, if predictably, it was Sam Bankman who? He becomes toxic. Like nobody wants to talk to him. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2313.76s)]
*  He has no friends. You watch everybody who rushed in rush out. Had Tom Brady react to this? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2321.92s)]
*  The first reaction was very sad. It was sadness. He clearly really liked him and he really liked [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2326.7200000000003s)]
*  the hope that he brought. I mean, a lot of people wanted there to be a Sam. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2332.24s)]
*  There is still a Sam Bankman-Friede-shaped hole in the world that now needs filling. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2336.3199999999997s)]
*  That character would be very useful. What he represented. What he wanted to do with the [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2340.7999999999997s)]
*  resources and Brady was, I think, crushed and I think his time has gone by and he ceased to get [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2344.8799999999997s)]
*  a really good explanation about what's happened. I think he's just like, he tricked me. I'm angry. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2350.9599999999996s)]
*  I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore. Starting in December, Lewis began driving the 45 [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2358.88s)]
*  miles from Berkeley to Stanford, where Bankman-Friede was living with his parents, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2364.4s)]
*  who have also been ensnared in legal proceedings tied to FTX. Out on bail, but wearing an ankle [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2369.36s)]
*  monitor, he left the door open for Lewis so they could continue their conversations. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2375.44s)]
*  We anticipated speaking with Bankman-Friede in August, but the judge in his case instituted a [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2381.52s)]
*  gag order and then put him in a Brooklyn jail for violating terms of his release. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2386.64s)]
*  Bankman-Friede has pled not guilty. He genuinely thinks he's innocent. I can tell you his state of [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2392.4s)]
*  mind four or five months ago. It's like, if you offered me plead guilty and do six months of house [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2398.0s)]
*  arrest, I'd still say no. What do you suspect his biggest fear is if he has to go to prison? Not [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2404.3199999999997s)]
*  having the internet. Now that sounds crazy, but I do think that if he had the internet, he could [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2409.2799999999997s)]
*  survive jail forever. Without having a constant stream of information to react to, I think he [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2415.28s)]
*  may go mad. If you gave Sam Bankman-Friede a choice, this is quite serious, of living in a 39 [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2420.8s)]
*  million dollar penthouse in the Bahamas without the internet or the Metropolitan Detention Center [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2428.5600000000004s)]
*  in Brooklyn with the internet, there's no question in my mind he'd take the jail. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2436.1600000000003s)]
*  Michael Lewis has never before written something that dovetails so dramatically with a sensationalized [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2440.64s)]
*  news event. Lewis's book Going Infinite comes out Tuesday, the same day Sam Bankman-Friede's trial begins. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2448.24s)]
*  He made a mockery of crypto in the eyes of many. He's sort of taken away the credibility of effective [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2456.72s)]
*  altruism. How do you see him? Everything you say is just true and it's more interesting than that. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2461.3599999999997s)]
*  Every cause he sought to serve, he damaged. Every cause he sought to fight, he helped. He was a [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2467.04s)]
*  person who set out in life to maximize the consequences of his actions, never mind the [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2473.2s)]
*  intent, and he had exactly the opposite effects of the ones he set out to have. So it looks to me like [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2478.4s)]
*  his life is a cruel joke. Michael Lewis on why he nearly stopped writing after his daughter's death. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj5i2Ter0I&t=2486.4s)]
