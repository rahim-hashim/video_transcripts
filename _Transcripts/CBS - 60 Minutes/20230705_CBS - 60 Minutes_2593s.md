**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs)
*  What are the stakes between the U.S. and China right now? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=0.0s)]
*  There are few places better than the Western Pacific on board the aircraft carrier USS [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=11.36s)]
*  Nimitz to find out. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=16.56s)]
*  Is the U.S. Navy ready? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=18.2s)]
*  We're ready. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=19.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=20.6s)]
*  I'll never admit to being ready enough. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=21.6s)]
*  Tonight, the commander of the United States Pacific Fleet talks about the state of the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=24.28s)]
*  U.S. Navy, China's growing fleet and new long-range missile systems and what our top gun pilots [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=28.76s)]
*  are seeing in the sky. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=37.32s)]
*  How aggressive has China become in the air? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=39.08s)]
*  Aggressive. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=42.28s)]
*  Is it your hope that the power of the U.S. Navy, the force posture of the U.S. Navy will [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=43.28s)]
*  deter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  It's not my hope, it's my duty. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=53.2s)]
*  Rocco Camisso doesn't suffer fools. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=57.56s)]
*  But like most Italian soccer fans, he does suffer. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=62.64s)]
*  Four years ago, he bought the team in Florence, where game day is filled with more agony and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=67.92s)]
*  ecstasy than a Puccini opera. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=74.36s)]
*  When Camisso bought ACF Fiorentina, it took two boxes. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=77.44s)]
*  First, it was a bargain for a European club. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  Second, it met the demand by his wife that if he insisted on buying a team, it had to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=87.12s)]
*  be someplace nice. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=93.32s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=97.08s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=98.56s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=99.84s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=101.24s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=102.52s)]
*  I'm Nora O'Donnell. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=103.88s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=105.28s)]
*  Those stories tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=106.72s)]
*  The United States Navy helped secure victory in two world wars and the Cold War. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=117.48s)]
*  Today, the Navy remains a formidable fighting force, but even officers within the service [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=123.08s)]
*  have questioned its readiness. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=128.52s)]
*  While the U.S. spent 20 years fighting land wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Pentagon [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=130.64s)]
*  watched China, its greatest geopolitical rival of the 21st century, build the largest navy [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=136.04s)]
*  in the world. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=142.92s)]
*  China has threatened to use that navy to invade Taiwan, an important American ally. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=144.28s)]
*  As tensions with China continue to rise, we wanted to know more about the current state [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=150.08s)]
*  of the U.S. Navy, how it's trying to deter China, and as we first reported in March, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=154.8s)]
*  preparing for the possibility of war. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=160.4s)]
*  The Navy's always on alert. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=167.32s)]
*  One-third of the Navy is always deployed and operating at all times. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=169.24s)]
*  The Navy's mustering right now about 300 ships, and there are about 100 ships at sea right [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=174.4s)]
*  now all around the globe. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  Admiral Samuel Papparo commands the U.S. Pacific Fleet, whose 200 ships and 150,000 sailors [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  and civilians make up 60 percent of the entire U.S. Navy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  We met him in February on the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, deployed near the U.S. territory [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=194.08s)]
*  of Guam, southeast of Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China, or PRC. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=199.96s)]
*  You've been operating as a naval officer for 40 years. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=205.96s)]
*  How has operating in the Western Pacific changed? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=209.88000000000002s)]
*  In the early 2000s, the PRC Navy mustered about 37 vessels. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  Today they're mustering 350 vessels. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=218.52s)]
*  In March, China's new foreign minister, Qin Gong, delivered a stern warning to the U.S. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=222.28s)]
*  He said that if Washington does not change course in its stance towards China, conflict [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=228.96s)]
*  and confrontation is inevitable. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=234.0s)]
*  This past August, when then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi became the most senior [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=237.4s)]
*  U.S. political figure to visit Taiwan in 25 years, China called it a blatant provocation. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  The People's Liberation Army fired ballistic missiles into the sea around Taiwan and encircled [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=249.96s)]
*  the island with aircraft and warships. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  So are Chinese warships now operating closer to Taiwan after Nancy Pelosi's visit? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=258.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=264.72s)]
*  The best guess anyone has about China's ultimate intentions for Taiwan comes from the CIA. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=266.92s)]
*  According to its intelligence assessment, China's President Xi Jinping has ordered [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=273.44s)]
*  the People's Liberation Army to be prepared to take back the island by force by 2027. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=278.6s)]
*  And if China invades Taiwan, what will the U.S. Navy do? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  It's a decision of the President of the United States and a decision of the Congress. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=289.72s)]
*  It's our duty to be ready for that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  But the bulk of the United States Navy will be deployed rapidly to the Western Pacific [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=297.16s)]
*  to come to the aid of Taiwan if the order comes to aid Taiwan in thwarting that invasion. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=304.52s)]
*  Is the U.S. Navy ready? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=311.32s)]
*  We're ready, yes. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=312.96s)]
*  I'll never admit to being ready enough. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=316.12s)]
*  President Biden has declared four times, including on 60 Minutes, that the U.S. military would [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  defend Taiwan, which is a democracy and the world's leading producer of advanced microchips. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=325.28s)]
*  To reach the USS Nimitz, we first traveled to America's westernmost territory, the island [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=333.52s)]
*  of Guam, in the middle of the Pacific. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=339.41999999999996s)]
*  Guam was taken by Imperial Japan two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=342.84s)]
*  U.S. Marines recaptured it two and a half years later. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  And the island, about the size of Chicago, became an indispensable strategic foothold [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=353.24s)]
*  in the Western Pacific as it remains today. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=358.18s)]
*  From Guam, we boarded a Navy C-2 Greyhound. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=362.32s)]
*  The Cold War-era transport plane takes people and supplies back and forth from land to the carrier. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=365.32s)]
*  It was a short flight to the ship and an even shorter landing. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=374.35999999999996s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=382.28s)]
*  First god landing? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=383.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=384.28s)]
*  Very nice. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=385.28s)]
*  Certain operations... [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=386.28s)]
*  Admiral Paparo rose to lead the Pacific Fleet. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=387.28s)]
*  He flew jets and graduated from the school known as Top Gun. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=390.44s)]
*  When you talk about ships, what's the most powerful in the U.S. Navy? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=394.96s)]
*  It's an aircraft carrier, and its air wing is capable of 150 strike or air-to-air sorties [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=398.55999999999995s)]
*  per day, with at its surge levels the ability to deliver 900 precision-guided munitions [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=405.79999999999995s)]
*  every day and reloadable every night. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=413.44s)]
*  So even though China now has the largest Navy in the world, they don't have anything like [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=417.32s)]
*  this in terms of aircraft carriers. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=421.72s)]
*  They do not, but they're working towards it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=423.44s)]
*  And they have two operational aircraft carriers right now. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=426.32s)]
*  That's China's two diesel-fueled carriers, to the U.S.'s 11 nuclear-powered ones that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=429.68s)]
*  can carry a total of about 1,000 attack aircraft, more than the Navy's of every other nation [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=436.0s)]
*  on Earth combined. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=441.92s)]
*  I'll tell you this. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  We are here to stay, right, in the South China Sea and in this part of the world. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think that's the message that we really want to convey to not only China, but the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=448.72s)]
*  entire world. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=453.40000000000003s)]
*  We will sail wherever international law allows. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  Lieutenant Commander David Ash flies an F-18. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=458.20000000000005s)]
*  Do you get briefed on China's growing military threat and the progress that their Navy is [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  making? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=471.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=472.72s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely we do. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=473.72s)]
*  And they are making great progress in a lot of key areas. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=474.72s)]
*  The Chinese? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  The Chinese are, from a military standpoint. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=478.52000000000004s)]
*  This video from Weapons Systems Officer Lieutenant Commander Matthew Carlton shows his F-18 [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=481.24s)]
*  strafing ground targets with a machine gun on a U.S. weapons range near Guam. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=487.56s)]
*  The pilots on the Nimitz also conduct air-to-air combat, or dogfighting drills daily. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=496.2s)]
*  How aggressive has China become in the air? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=503.8s)]
*  Aggressive. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=507.2s)]
*  And just some examples include unsafe, unprofessional intercepts where they move within single digits [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=508.24s)]
*  of feet of other aircraft, flashing the weapons that they have on board of the other aircraft, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=514.82s)]
*  operating in international airspace, maneuvering their aircraft in such a way that denies the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=520.3000000000001s)]
*  ability to turn in one direction. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=527.22s)]
*  If they're safe and professional, then there's no problem. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=529.86s)]
*  Everybody has the right to fly and sail wherever international law dictates. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=533.74s)]

*  Plants like the U.S. destroyer Wayne E. Meyer, part of the Nimitz strike group, would need [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=765.5799999999999s)]
*  to sail much closer towards China to fire their missiles at any force invading Taiwan. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=770.3s)]
*  One naval scholar we spoke to likened it to a boxing match in which a fighter, in this [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=777.92s)]
*  case China, has much longer arms than their potential opponent, the U.S. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=783.4599999999999s)]
*  I'll give you a lot of examples where a shorter fighter was able to prevail over a long-armed [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=790.66s)]
*  fighter by being on their toes, by maneuvering. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=795.98s)]

*  fast-attack submarines patrolling the Pacific at any time. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=835.54s)]

*  How much more advanced is U.S. submarine technology than Chinese capability? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=844.7s)]

*  Since Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, China's military leaders have themselves been mostly [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=862.6600000000001s)]

*  The U.S. could also be affected by a number of U.S. nuclear attacks on American cities [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=932.26s)]

*  I think we share a sense of the urgency of the moment. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1135.1399999999999s)]
*  We see increasing threats from China in particular, in the Indo-Pacific. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1137.7399999999998s)]

*  If you think about what a coherent grand strategy vis-a-vis China would be, hard power would [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1224.62s)]
*  be the most important part of that and the Navy would be the most important component [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1228.6999999999998s)]
*  of your hard power investments. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1232.1399999999999s)]
*  Over the last two decades, the Navy spent $55 billion on two investments that did not [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1235.06s)]
*  pan out. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1241.52s)]
*  The first was a class of destroyers known as the Zumwalt. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1243.08s)]
*  The futuristic fighting ships were supposed to revolutionize naval warfare. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1247.0s)]
*  32 were ordered, but only three were ever launched. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1252.04s)]
*  The cost of each ship by one estimate was upwards of $8 billion, making them the three [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1256.76s)]
*  most expensive destroyers ever put to sea. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1263.3999999999999s)]
*  Another example is the Littoral Combat Ship, or LCS, designed to be a fast, all-purpose [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1268.74s)]
*  warship for shallow waters. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1274.42s)]

*  Within the Navy, the LCS earned the unfortunate nickname, Little Crappy Ship. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1285.02s)]
*  The Navy's last few decades have been described as a lost generation of shipbuilding. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1291.28s)]
*  Is that overly dramatic? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1296.08s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1298.1799999999998s)]
*  We're still struggling to build ships on time, on budget, and that's something we absolutely [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1299.3799999999999s)]
*  need to fix going forward. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1304.2199999999998s)]
*  This past March, we spoke with Admiral Mike Gilday at the Pentagon. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1305.86s)]
*  He is the chief of naval operations and is responsible for building, maintaining, and [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1309.7399999999998s)]
*  equipping the entire U.S. Navy. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1315.34s)]
*  Is the Navy in crisis? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1318.02s)]
*  No. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1319.3s)]
*  The Navy's not in crisis. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1320.3s)]
*  The Navy is out on point every single day. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1322.06s)]
*  Is it being outpaced by China? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1326.1s)]
*  No. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1327.68s)]
*  Our Navy's still in a position to prevail, but that's not blind confidence. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1328.68s)]
*  We are concerned with the trajectory that China's on, with China's behavior, but we [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1334.1200000000001s)]
*  are in a good position right now if we did ever get into a fight against them. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1339.0800000000002s)]
*  How would you describe what China has been able to do militarily over the last 20 years? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1343.68s)]
*  The most alarming thing is the growth of not only their conventional forces, but also their [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1349.3600000000001s)]
*  strategic nuclear forces, their cyber capability, their space capability, and how they're using [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1354.32s)]
*  that to force other nations, navies, out of certain areas in the South China Sea. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1360.34s)]
*  Instead of recognizing international law, they want to control where those goods flow [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1366.8999999999999s)]
*  and how. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1371.86s)]
*  What lessons did the U.S. Navy learn from some of the shipbuilding mistakes of the last [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1373.02s)]
*  20 years? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1377.9399999999998s)]
*  I think one of the things that we learned was that we need to have a design well in [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1378.94s)]
*  place before we begin bending metal. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1384.8200000000002s)]
*  And so we are going back to the past, to what we did in the 80s and the 90s. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1387.38s)]
*  The Navy has the lead. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1392.66s)]
*  There is a tendency among the great powers to look at each other's naval buildups with [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1394.64s)]
*  deep suspicion. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1400.02s)]
*  Toshi Yoshihara of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments may know more than [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1401.02s)]
*  scholar in the West about China's Navy. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1407.5s)]
*  China will have about 440 ships by 2030, and that's according to the Pentagon. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1410.84s)]
*  Why is China able to build more warships more quickly than the U.S.? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1417.18s)]
*  China has clearly invested in this defense industrial infrastructure to produce these [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1422.3s)]
*  ships, which allows them to produce multiple ships simultaneously, essentially outbuilding [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1426.74s)]
*  many of the Western navies combined. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1433.02s)]
*  China's Navy piggybacks on a booming commercial shipbuilding industry kept afloat by generous [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1435.74s)]
*  state subsidies, inexpensive materials, and cheap labor. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1441.42s)]
*  In the United States, it's a different story. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1446.42s)]
*  After the Cold War ended, the shipbuilding industry consolidated, and many of the yards [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1449.86s)]
*  where ships were both built and maintained closed down. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1454.86s)]
*  What do you see when you see China's shipbuilding program? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1459.26s)]
*  It's very robust. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1461.3s)]
*  Do we have enough shipyards? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1462.3s)]
*  No. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1464.18s)]
*  I wish that we had more commercial shipyards. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1465.26s)]
*  Over my career, we've gone from more than 30 shipyards down to about seven that we rely [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1467.3400000000001s)]
*  upon on a day-to-day basis to build ships. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1471.7s)]
*  One of those yards is run by Huntington Ingalls Industries, which built the state-of-the-art [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1474.8200000000002s)]
*  new Ford-class aircraft carrier. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1480.5s)]
*  After controlled explosions in 2021 to prove it could withstand combat, the Ford got closer [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1483.26s)]
*  to deployment, six years late and billions of dollars over budget. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1493.9s)]
*  The Navy's not just struggling to build new ships on time. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1499.8600000000001s)]
*  According to the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, there's a multi-year backlog [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1503.18s)]
*  repairing the ships in the fleet. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1508.5s)]
*  Our maintenance backlog is one of the primary things that I'm working on to correct. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1511.22s)]
*  So just three years ago, we had 7,700 delay days, that is extra days in a shipyard by [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1516.74s)]
*  ships when they weren't operational. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1524.5s)]
*  We have cut that down to 3,000. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1526.94s)]
*  We are not satisfied. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1529.6200000000001s)]
*  Maintenance delays mean sailors can't come home because the ship that's supposed to replace [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1531.66s)]
*  them is not ready. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1536.3s)]
*  It means longer deployments. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1537.88s)]
*  It means away from your family more. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1539.96s)]
*  That's a big strain on the workforce. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1542.22s)]
*  The more ships that we can have available to send at sea alleviates many of those problems [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1544.22s)]
*  that you pointed out. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1549.28s)]
*  Sailors join the Navy to see the world. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1551.3400000000001s)]
*  And so it's my job to make sure that those maintenance delays go to zero and we can get [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1553.46s)]
*  those ships to sea as quickly as possible. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1559.14s)]
*  In the last year alone, at least 10 sailors assigned to ships undergoing maintenance or [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1561.8200000000002s)]
*  working at maintenance facilities have died by suicide. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1566.76s)]
*  It is a problem that we're taking very, very seriously. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1571.46s)]
*  And down to every leader in our Navy, everybody has a responsibility to look out for each [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1575.66s)]
*  other, take care of each other. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1580.5s)]
*  There is no wrong door to knock on when you need help. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1582.5400000000002s)]
*  Admiral Gilday says the U.S. Navy's main advantage over China is America's sailors. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1585.7s)]
*  His goal is to modernize the U.S. fleet and have those sailors serving alongside hundreds [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1591.74s)]
*  of unmanned vessels by 2045. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1597.3000000000002s)]
*  I think unmanned is the future. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1600.68s)]
*  And so I think that some 40 percent of our fleet in the future, I believe, is going to be unmanned. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1602.44s)]
*  Are these like underwater drones? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1607.92s)]
*  Some of them are highly capable, capable of delivering mines and perhaps other types of weapons. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1610.2800000000002s)]
*  Admiral Gilday is talking about the Orca, an extra-large unmanned undersea vehicle. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1615.8000000000002s)]
*  Can you say what it will do or is that classified? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1622.44s)]
*  Well, at a minimum, it'll have a clandestine mine laying capability. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1624.68s)]
*  So it'll be done in a way that is very secretive, but very effective. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1629.02s)]
*  But the GAO reports that it's already a quarter of a billion dollars over budget and three [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1634.06s)]

*  Rocco Camiso was 12 years old when his family moved to the United States from southern Italy. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1740.54s)]
*  With the hustle he learned on the streets of the Bronx and exceptional timing, Camiso [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1745.5s)]
*  built a cable TV empire and a net worth of eight billion dollars. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1750.26s)]
*  So what did he do with his made in the USA fortune? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1755.94s)]
*  Rocco Camiso returned to the land of his birth. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1759.46s)]
*  And as we reported in March, he bought a pro soccer team. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1762.56s)]
*  You've described yourself as a hustler. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1767.66s)]

*  Don't take no for an answer. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1786.66s)]
*  I've heard that you have no tolerance for people you call spinners. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1788.8200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1792.7s)]
*  What's a spinner? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1793.7s)]
*  Spinner is a bullsh** artist. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1794.7s)]
*  I know plenty of those guys. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1796.5800000000002s)]

*  Did you learn that in the Bronx? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1801.66s)]
*  No, my mother gave it to me when I was born. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1803.18s)]
*  Rocco Camiso doesn't suffer fools. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1807.42s)]
*  But like most Italian soccer fans, he does suffer. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1815.9s)]
*  Four years ago, he bought the team in Florence, where game day is filled with more agony. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1821.8200000000002s)]
*  And ecstasy than a Puccini opera. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1828.14s)]
*  We watched as the city's diehard fans called the Tifosi endured a collective 90-minute [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1840.98s)]
*  long breakdown. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1848.8200000000002s)]
*  I don't speak Italian, but I think I know what they're saying. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1851.8200000000002s)]
*  Camiso, who is 73, knows the Tifosi follow his reactions. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1855.1s)]
*  So he tries to keep a poker face as he chews wads of nicotine gum. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1859.86s)]
*  How many of these do you go through? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1865.5s)]
*  A lot. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1867.3s)]
*  A game? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1868.3s)]
*  Like 15, 20. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1869.3s)]
*  Depends on the game, right? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1871.3s)]
*  When Camiso bought Fiorentina, it ticked two boxes. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1876.46s)]
*  First, the $170 million price was a bargain for a European club. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1880.1799999999998s)]
*  Second, it met the demand by his wife that if he insisted on buying a team, it had to [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1885.6599999999999s)]
*  be someplace nice. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1891.78s)]
*  When I landed in Florence, outside the airport, there were a mass of people there. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1893.78s)]
*  And the first words that I used, chiamatemi Rocco, call me Rocco. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1899.02s)]
*  Because over here, titles are very important. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1903.98s)]
*  I said, I don't need titles. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1906.22s)]
*  You don't have to call me mister. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1907.22s)]
*  Just call me Rocco. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1909.3400000000001s)]
*  And today, they call me Rocco. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1910.3400000000001s)]
*  Fiorentina, which is nicknamed La Viola or the Purple, has not won a league championship [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1912.78s)]
*  since 1969. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1919.5400000000002s)]
*  The Tifosi got sick of waiting and ran the previous owner out of town. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1923.0600000000002s)]
*  The T-Fold, the fans, first they're everything. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1928.38s)]
*  But they could be nasty if you don't win. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1932.5400000000002s)]
*  The highs are high and the lows are low, it seems like. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1935.86s)]
*  But they can't kick Rocco out of here. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1937.82s)]
*  They think they're going to criticize him and kick me out. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1940.02s)]
*  No, that can't happen. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1942.34s)]
*  Rocco's a little different. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1944.26s)]
*  How are you different? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1945.26s)]
*  First of all, there's not been anyone here that's put in the money that I put in in a [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1946.54s)]
*  short period of time. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1952.42s)]
*  And I go back to the Medici from 500 years ago. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1953.42s)]
*  If I lose 500 million, 400 million, I'm not going to go and wash the dishes again the [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1956.46s)]
*  way I did when I was a young man. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1960.54s)]
*  So, watch out what you do because you don't know what's going to come next. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1962.1s)]
*  Rocco Camisa's journey to the owner's box in Florence began here by the subway in the [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1965.86s)]
*  Bronx. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1973.4599999999998s)]
*  His father, a carpenter, and his older brother came to the U.S. in the 50s to escape poverty. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1975.1799999999998s)]
*  A few years later, they sent for Rocco, his mother and two sisters. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1981.1399999999999s)]
*  When we came here in 63, my brother bought the house. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1985.8999999999999s)]
*  God bless him. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1989.98s)]
*  This was like a luxury to us. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1992.18s)]
*  And we lived upstairs on the second floor. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1994.7s)]
*  Camisa's English was terrible, but he played a mean accordion. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=1998.3000000000002s)]
*  So at age 13, he cut his first deal. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2002.02s)]
*  Rocco agreed to perform for free at a Bronx theater if the manager helped get him into [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2005.42s)]
*  the Catholic All Boys High School, Mount St. Michael Academy. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2010.22s)]
*  It is still a launching pad for young men from immigrant families. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2015.02s)]
*  Even though I had not taken the test to get in, I asked the manager to please send the [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2020.18s)]
*  recommendation letter. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2024.5s)]
*  He did, and they admitted me. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2025.5s)]
*  So you never took the test, but did you have to play the accordion? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2026.9s)]
*  They didn't let me play the accordion because the band did not have the accordion. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2030.02s)]
*  But just on your accordion skills alone, you were given entrance? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2033.78s)]
*  I got lucky or hustled, whichever way you want to call it. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2038.3400000000001s)]
*  He kept hustling. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2042.9s)]
*  Every day before and after school, he worked at his family's luncheonette near the subway [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2044.5600000000002s)]
*  station to pay his high school tuition. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2049.78s)]
*  So I used to get paid $1 an hour, and through that $1 an hour, I paid four years of Mount St. Michael [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2052.26s)]
*  schooling. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2060.7400000000002s)]
*  Now, it didn't cost a lot of money then, but it was still something. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2061.7400000000002s)]
*  Camiso wanted to be an engineer, but a dollar an hour wasn't going to pay for college. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2065.78s)]
*  So Camiso hunted down a scholarship for a sport he always loved, soccer. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2071.3s)]
*  Never mind that his high school didn't have a team and he'd not played much since coming to America. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2076.82s)]
*  And somehow you end up with a soccer scholarship to Columbia. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2082.9s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2088.42s)]
*  Hustle. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2090.1800000000003s)]
*  I needed money to go to school. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2090.82s)]
*  So I asked the gym teacher to go and call the NYU coach. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2092.6600000000003s)]
*  The NYU coach puts me in the American Czechoslovak team in the German-American league, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2095.78s)]
*  sees me play six games, says, yeah, I like the kid, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2100.58s)]
*  so let me help him get into NYU, which he did, and they gave me 50% scholarship, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2104.18s)]
*  but that was not enough. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2108.66s)]
*  So I then told the gym teacher, go and call the coach at Columbia now. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2110.3399999999997s)]
*  In the space of three to four weeks, they give me admissions to Columbia and a full scholarship. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2114.2599999999998s)]
*  Have they seen you play? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2121.94s)]
*  No. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2123.2999999999997s)]
*  I asked that question after they admitted me. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2123.7799999999997s)]
*  But let me ask you, you give me all this money and you don't want to see me play? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2126.8199999999997s)]
*  Is this rocker if you're good enough for NYU, you're good enough for Columbia? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2129.22s)]
*  Camiso became team captain and led Columbia to its first NCAA tournament. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2133.62s)]
*  After graduation and an MBA, he made his way to Wall Street. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2139.4599999999996s)]
*  At night, though, he was helping his brother run a disco. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2144.18s)]
*  Rival clubs played the Bee Gees, but not Camiso. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2148.02s)]
*  He chose to play pop music from Italy. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2151.3799999999997s)]
*  I was really into Italian music and came up with this idea that by specializing in something, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2154.58s)]
*  as opposed to being just like anybody else, you know, we could do well. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2160.98s)]
*  And nobody could touch us in terms of the competition because nobody had it. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2165.46s)]
*  Camiso became an executive in the cable TV industry just as it exploded. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2169.94s)]
*  Then in 1995, he decided it was time to start a business he named MediaCom. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2175.22s)]
*  Like the disco, he designed a plan to seize an opportunity others had missed. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2181.46s)]
*  I was an eight-page paper that talked about what I foresee in terms of the cable business. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2187.06s)]
*  What did you foresee? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2194.1s)]
*  What I foresaw is the fact that sooner or later, we're going to get deregulated. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2195.06s)]
*  And there's a great opportunity to do well in the smaller markets of the U.S., [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2200.66s)]
*  the rural markets, largely because nobody wanted them. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2207.06s)]
*  Rocco Camiso believed those small markets had buried treasure. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2210.5800000000004s)]
*  Six hundred thousand miles of cable used to carry computer data [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2214.82s)]
*  through places such as the Corn Belt and deep south. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2218.9s)]
*  He risked his life savings to buy up the small systems. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2222.5s)]
*  Again, timing and luck were on his side. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2226.42s)]
*  Today, MediaCom provides broadband in 22 states, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2229.6200000000003s)]
*  and Rocco Camiso's net worth is $8 billion. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2234.5s)]
*  It's a private company. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2237.3s)]
*  Catherine Camiso, Rocco's wife of 47 years, works there. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2240.9s)]
*  So does his sister, Italia, and his son, Joe, on the left. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2244.9s)]
*  Outside MediaCom headquarters in upstate New York is a bocce court. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2249.78s)]
*  Inside, espresso flows. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2254.5800000000004s)]
*  Camiso told us he had a streak of 25 years of profits and has never laid off workers. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2257.46s)]
*  I have heard so many people say it's not personal, it's business. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2263.7799999999997s)]
*  That's crap. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2268.58s)]
*  I think the personal, frankly, has a lot to do with why companies fail or succeed. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2270.34s)]
*  Unfortunately, unfortunately, there's no one like me in our business. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2278.1s)]
*  And I'm talking about the media, newspapers. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2282.82s)]
*  But I hate to destroy people's lives because I have to go in and make an extra million dollars. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2286.02s)]
*  Camiso made a point to us that he does not own a yacht, a mansion on the beach, or a private jet. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2293.22s)]
*  Of course, we had to point out he did buy an Italian soccer team. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2299.2999999999997s)]
*  When I came here, I used three things. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2305.22s)]
*  Fast, fast, fast, that the coast will be okay, you know, within my means, and control, control, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2307.46s)]
*  control. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2314.34s)]
*  I control, or no money from Rocco. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2315.06s)]
*  That's the way it works. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2317.86s)]
*  What's harder, running a company like MediaCom or running a soccer team? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2319.7s)]
*  This is significantly more difficult. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2324.02s)]
*  I got more criticism here than in 1,500 communities in the U.S. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2326.18s)]
*  The American owner is under relentless scrutiny by Fiorentina fans who demand that he shells out [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2334.58s)]
*  whatever it costs to bring in stars and end their 50-year championship drought. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2340.5s)]
*  Then there's been times when he's lost it with the unforgiving Italian press. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2346.18s)]
*  Have you ever thought, what have I done? What did I get myself into? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2356.74s)]
*  No. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2361.06s)]
*  It's a lot of aggravations. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2361.54s)]
*  That's not me. No, I made the decision. I'm going to stick with the decision. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2362.66s)]
*  True to Rocco's way, he's playing the long game by spending $100 million on this. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2366.66s)]
*  It's called Viola Park. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2372.8999999999996s)]
*  The camisos showed us around what will be one of the largest soccer facilities in Europe [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2374.58s)]
*  for developing young male and female players. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2379.46s)]
*  But this is Italy. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2382.98s)]
*  You see that opening there where you have the two Vs? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2385.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2387.54s)]
*  Right in the middle. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2387.86s)]
*  We had to break the building apart because there's a Roman wall there, rocks. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2388.9s)]
*  Stop it. You hit a Roman wall? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2394.34s)]
*  Yeah, so we had to uncover it, cover it up, but break the building. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2396.9s)]
*  We could not build on top of the Roman wall. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2401.2999999999997s)]
*  Despite the agita and the so-so season, Rocco Camisso still seems to love this business. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2405.46s)]
*  He's become one of the most famous Americans in Italy [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2411.54s)]
*  and adores his players. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2416.5s)]
*  Some who look like Michelangelo himself may have carved them out of marble. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2418.34s)]
*  My job is to hug them, kiss them, put my arms around them, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2423.94s)]
*  and hope that they do better the next time. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2427.46s)]
*  No tough talk? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2429.54s)]
*  You know, they get the message indirectly, you know, that things gotta change here. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2430.8199999999997s)]
*  How do they get the message? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2435.8599999999997s)]
*  You know, they get the message. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2438.02s)]
*  Never mind. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2439.54s)]
*  And if you're wondering if Camisso still plays a mean accordion, here's your answer. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2443.7799999999997s)]
*  Our visit to Florence ended with dinner and a serenade by the billionaire from the Bronx. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2454.4199999999996s)]
*  Do you think if you had stayed in Italy, you'd have been able to achieve the success that you have today? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2460.74s)]
*  No way. This is truly the land of opportunity. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2476.18s)]
*  He gave this poor soul, okay, yeah, the opportunity to become something, somebody, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2479.54s)]
*  and that's the beauty about America. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2488.26s)]
*  You still believe in the American dream? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2490.6600000000003s)]
*  Absolutely, yeah. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2493.0600000000004s)]
*  That's the last hope in the world. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2494.42s)]
*  But my own provided me a phenomenal education. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2496.98s)]
*  Rocco Camisso has given millions to his alma mater's and has contributed the scholarships [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2500.1800000000003s)]
*  for nearly 3,000 students across the U.S., including many first-generation immigrants like him. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2505.2200000000003s)]
*  I just want to be known as the guy that nothing, success never changed him. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2512.98s)]
*  Just Rocco. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2517.86s)]
*  Just Rocco. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2518.7400000000002s)]
*  More on tonight's stories, including how similar is the movie to actual Top Gun? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2524.26s)]
*  Top Gun graduates compare the movie to the real thing at 60minutesovertime.com. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2531.38s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2540.5s)]
*  One of the most important things we talk about every day is following your curiosity. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2548.58s)]
*  I can hear it call. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2552.58s)]
*  I'm a very curious person. I wake up every morning asking, you know, what's happening in the world? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2554.6600000000003s)]
*  Why is this happening and how do we answer that question? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2559.46s)]
*  A story's just begun. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2561.7000000000003s)]
*  Why did you want to share your story? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2563.7000000000003s)]
*  Water up this high? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2565.2200000000003s)]
*  Where are these coming from? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2567.2200000000003s)]
*  That's the million dollar question. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2568.26s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2569.54s)]
*  I'm hanging in there. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2570.98s)]
*  I believe in the power of storytelling to change lives. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2572.02s)]
*  You'll have to tell him when he gets older, when you were two months old. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2574.98s)]
*  He was on the news. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2576.98s)]
*  The news doesn't have to always be depressing. It can be uplifting. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-z1YGTzgs&t=2578.98s)]
