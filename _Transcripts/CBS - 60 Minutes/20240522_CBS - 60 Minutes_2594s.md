*  That's chilling. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=51.4s)]
*  There's no doubt that the Cubans are still penetrating our government with individuals [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=52.4s)]
*  who are loyal to them and not to us. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=58.96s)]

*  Francis is the first pope from the Americas. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=112.2s)]
*  The first of his name and more than any other pope in recent memory has dedicated his life [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=122.2s)]
*  and ministry to the poor, the peripheral and the forgotten. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=127.72s)]
*  All while leading the Catholic Church on difficult, sometimes controversial issues that not everyone [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=132.28s)]
*  supports. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=138.16s)]
*  We were granted a rare interview at the Vatican and spoke to him in his native Spanish through [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=139.5s)]
*  a translator for more than an hour. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=144.82s)]
*  Not lost in translation was the 87-year-old's warmth, intelligence and conviction. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=148.2s)]
*  We began by discussing the Church's First World Children's Day. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=154.6s)]
*  Next weekend, Pope Francis will welcome tens of thousands of young people to the Vatican, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=158.78s)]
*  including refugees of war. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=163.94s)]
*  During World Children's Day, the UN says over a million people will be facing famine in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=168.3s)]
*  Gaza, many of them children. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=174.06s)]
*  Not just in Gaza. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=179.26000000000002s)]
*  Think of Ukraine. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  Many kids from Ukraine come here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=183.22s)]
*  You know something? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=186.9s)]
*  That those children don't know how to smile. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=188.5s)]
*  I'll say something to them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  We have forgotten how to smile, and that is very painful. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=196.62s)]
*  Do you have a message for Vladimir Putin when it comes to Ukraine? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=201.22s)]
*  Please, warring countries, all of them, stop. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=206.22s)]
*  Stop the war. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  You must find a way of negotiating for peace. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=213.84s)]
*  Strive for peace. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=217.22s)]
*  A negotiated peace is always better than an endless war. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=220.01999999999998s)]
*  What's happening in Israel and Gaza has caused so much division, so much pain around the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  world. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=234.74s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen in the United States big protests on college campuses and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=235.74s)]
*  growing anti-Semitism. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=242.62s)]
*  What would you say about how to change that? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=245.1s)]
*  All ideology is bad, and anti-Semitism is an ideology, and it is bad. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=248.3s)]
*  Any anti is always bad. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=257.06s)]
*  You can criticize one government or another, the government of Israel, the Palestinian [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=259.7s)]
*  government. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=265.5s)]
*  You can criticize all you want, but not anti a people. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=266.5s)]
*  Neither anti-Palestinian nor anti-Semitic. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=271.94s)]
*  No. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=274.74s)]
*  I know you call for peace. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=275.86s)]
*  You have called for a ceasefire in many of your sermons. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=278.14s)]
*  Can you help negotiate peace? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  What I can do is pray. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=285.38s)]
*  I pray a lot for peace, and also to suggest, please stop negotiating. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=288.74s)]
*  Prayer has been at the center of the pope's life since he was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=296.78s)]
*  in 1936 into a family of Italian immigrants. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=303.3s)]
*  Before entering the seminary, Bergoglio worked as a chemist. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=308.5s)]
*  His own personal formula is simplicity. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=312.78000000000003s)]
*  He still wears the plain silver cross he wore as the Archbishop of Buenos Aires. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=316.38s)]
*  Though it's not what Francis wears, but where he lives that set the tone for his papacy [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=322.94s)]
*  11 years ago. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=328.98s)]
*  Instead of a palace above St. Peter's Square, he chose the Vatican guesthouse, Casa Santa [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=331.46s)]
*  Marta, as his home. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=337.02s)]
*  We met him there under a painting of the Virgin Mary. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=340.38s)]
*  Surrounded by the sacred, Francis has not forsaken his sense of humor, even when discussing [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=344.1s)]
*  serious subjects like the migrant crisis. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=350.46s)]
*  My grandparents were Catholic, immigrated from Northern Ireland in the 1930s to the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=354.02s)]
*  United States seeking a better life. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=360.3s)]
*  And I know your family too, fled fascism. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=363.94s)]
*  And you have talked about with migrants, many of them children, that you encourage governments [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=367.65999999999997s)]
*  to build bridges, not walls. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=373.06s)]
*  Migration is something that makes a country grow. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=377.78s)]
*  They say that you Irish migrated and brought the whiskey. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=382.5s)]
*  Or that the Italians migrated and brought the mafia. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=388.26s)]
*  It's a joke, don't take it badly. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=393.06s)]
*  But migrants sometimes suffer a lot. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=398.97999999999996s)]
*  They suffer a lot. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=401.46s)]
*  I grew up in Texas, and I don't know if you've heard, but the state of Texas is attempting [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=404.26s)]
*  to shut down a Catholic charity on the border with Mexico that offers undocumented migrants [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=409.29999999999995s)]
*  humanitarian assistance. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=416.66s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=419.3s)]
*  That is madness, sheer madness. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=422.98s)]
*  To close the border and leave them there, that is madness. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=425.58000000000004s)]
*  The migrant has to be received. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=429.94000000000005s)]
*  Thereafter you see how you're going to deal with them. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=432.3s)]
*  Maybe you have to send them back. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=434.82000000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  But each case ought to be considered humanely, right? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=437.42s)]
*  A few months after becoming Pope, Francis went to a small Italian island near Africa [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=442.5s)]
*  to meet migrants fleeing poverty and war. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=449.06s)]
*  Your first trip as Pope was the island of Lampedusa, where you talked about suffering. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=453.38s)]
*  And I was so struck when you talked about the globalization of indifference. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=459.90000000000003s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=466.24s)]
*  Do you want me to state it plainly? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=468.04s)]
*  People wash their hands. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=471.2s)]
*  There are so many Pontius Pilates on the loose out there who see what is happening, the wars, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=473.0s)]
*  the injustice, the crimes. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=480.04s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=485.16s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=486.16s)]
*  And wash their hands. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=487.16s)]
*  It's indifference. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=489.08s)]
*  That is what happens when the heart hardens and becomes indifferent. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=490.08s)]
*  Please, we have to get our hearts to feel again. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=495.96s)]
*  We cannot remain indifferent in the face of such human dramas. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=501.0s)]
*  The globalization of indifference is a very ugly disease. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=505.48s)]
*  Very ugly. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=512.0s)]
*  Pope Francis has not been indifferent to the Church's most insidious scandal, the rampant [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=516.84s)]
*  sexual abuse of hundreds of thousands of children worldwide for decades. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=522.28s)]
*  You have done more than anyone to try and reform the Catholic Church and repent for [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=528.12s)]
*  years of unspeakable sexual abuse against children by members of the clergy. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=532.56s)]
*  But has the Church done enough? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=538.1s)]

*  Unfortunately, the tragedy of the abuses is enormous. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=543.76s)]
*  And against this, an upright conscience. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=548.72s)]
*  And not only to not permit it, but to put in place the conditions so that it does not [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=552.24s)]
*  happen. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  You have said zero tolerance. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=559.28s)]
*  It cannot be tolerated. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=563.2s)]
*  When there is a case of a religious man or woman who abuses, the full force of the law [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=565.6s)]
*  falls upon them. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=570.96s)]
*  In this, there has been a great deal of progress. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=572.64s)]
*  That's Francis' capacity for forgiveness and openness that has defined his leadership [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=577.68s)]
*  of the Church's nearly 1.4 billion Catholics. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=582.92s)]
*  He put them and the world on notice during an impromptu press conference on a plane in [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=587.28s)]
*  2013, when he spoke on the subject of homosexuality. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=592.64s)]
*  If someone is gay, he said, and he searches for the Lord and has goodwill, who am I to [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=598.8399999999999s)]
*  judge? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=605.04s)]
*  And he did not stop there. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=606.36s)]
*  Last year, you decided to allow Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=608.76s)]
*  That's a big change. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=614.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=615.44s)]
*  No, what I allowed was not to bless the union. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=616.44s)]
*  That cannot be done because that is not the sacrament. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=623.28s)]
*  I cannot. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=627.32s)]
*  The Lord made it that way. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=628.32s)]
*  But to bless each person? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=630.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=632.48s)]
*  The blessing is for everyone. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=633.88s)]
*  For everyone. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=637.72s)]
*  To bless a homosexual-type union, however, goes against the given right, against the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=638.72s)]
*  law of the Church. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=647.24s)]
*  But to bless each person? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=650.28s)]
*  Why not? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=653.52s)]
*  The blessing is for all. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=654.52s)]
*  Some people were scandalized by this, but why? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=657.08s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=660.96s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=661.96s)]
*  You have said, who am I to judge? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=663.96s)]
*  Homosexuality is not a crime. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=667.5600000000001s)]
*  No, it's a human fact. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=669.5600000000001s)]
*  There are conservative bishops in the United States that oppose your new efforts to revisit [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=672.84s)]
*  teachings and traditions. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=678.9200000000001s)]
*  How do you address their criticism? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=681.12s)]
*  You used an adjective, conservative. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=685.52s)]
*  That is, conservative is one who clings to something and does not want to see beyond [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=690.0s)]
*  that. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=695.68s)]
*  It is a suicidal attitude. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=696.68s)]
*  Because one thing is to take tradition into account, to consider situations from the past, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=700.4s)]
*  but quite another is to be closed up inside a dogmatic box. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=706.88s)]
*  Pope Francis has placed more women in positions of power than any of his predecessors, but [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=712.48s)]
*  he told us he opposes allowing women to be ordained as priests or deacons. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=718.84s)]
*  Francis' devotion to traditional doctrine led one Vatican reporter to note that he's [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=725.9200000000001s)]
*  changed the tune of the Church, but the lyrics essentially remain the same. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=730.72s)]
*  This frustrates those who want to see him change policy on Roman Catholic priests marrying, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=736.4s)]
*  contraception, and surrogate motherhood. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=742.72s)]
*  I know women who are cancer survivors, who cannot bear children, and they turn to surrogacy. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=745.8s)]
*  This is against Church doctrine. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=754.92s)]
*  In regard to surrogate motherhood, in the strictest sense of the term, no, it is not [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=758.3599999999999s)]
*  authorized. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  Sometimes surrogacy has become a business, and that is very bad. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=765.56s)]
*  It is very bad. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=769.4s)]
*  But sometimes for some women it is the only hope. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=771.76s)]
*  It could be. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=775.08s)]
*  The other hope is adoption. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=776.6800000000001s)]
*  I would say that in each case the situation should be carefully and clearly considered, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=779.24s)]
*  consulting medically and then morally as well. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=787.24s)]
*  I think there is a general rule in these cases, but you have to go into each case in particular [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=792.4000000000001s)]
*  to assess the situation, as long as the moral principle is not skirted. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=799.56s)]
*  But you are right. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=808.56s)]
*  I want to tell you that I really liked your expression when you told me, in some cases [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=809.56s)]
*  it is the only chance. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=816.28s)]
*  It shows that you feel these things very deeply. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=818.8s)]
*  I think that is why so many people have found hope with you, because you have been more [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=824.1999999999999s)]
*  open and accepting, perhaps, than other previous leaders of the Church. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=830.1999999999999s)]
*  You have to be open to everything. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=839.1999999999999s)]
*  The Church is like that. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=842.1999999999999s)]
*  Everyone, everyone, everyone. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=844.1999999999999s)]

*  Last month, a career American ambassador pleaded guilty to spying for the intelligence [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=928.4s)]
*  service of Cuba. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=933.4s)]
*  Victor Manuel Rocha served his country in positions that required the highest levels [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=935.4s)]
*  of security clearance. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=939.4s)]
*  For 40 years, he was a covert agent. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=941.4s)]
*  Before Ambassador Rocha was exposed, there was another prolific Cuban spy named Ana [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=944.4s)]

*  Brian Lattell was the CIA's top Cuba analyst at the height of the Cold War. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1091.8000000000002s)]
*  He says in the 1980s Rocha cold called and struck up a professional relationship. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1096.8000000000002s)]
*  They remained friends for decades. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1101.8000000000002s)]
*  You think he approached you to get information out of you ultimately? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1104.8000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1108.8000000000002s)]
*  He never got any. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1109.8000000000002s)]
*  Did you see any signs that he was leading a double life? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1111.8000000000002s)]
*  None. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1115.8000000000002s)]
*  None? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1116.8000000000002s)]
*  None. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1117.8000000000002s)]
*  Why don't you tell me about the tradecraft that Cuba uses? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1119.2s)]
*  They do it very, very well in mostly rudimentary fashions. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1122.2s)]
*  The Cubans are not flying satellites anywhere in the world. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1127.2s)]
*  Nearly all of their ability and success has been in the dimension of human intelligence. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1130.2s)]
*  Their officers, their intelligence agents and officers are very, very good. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1136.2s)]
*  They know their tradecraft. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1141.2s)]
*  They practice it with great skill and with discipline. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1143.2s)]
*  And when they recruit, they're very careful about how they recruit and how they communicate. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1147.6000000000001s)]
*  And what does Cuba do with the information it gets from all these spies? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1152.6000000000001s)]
*  They have no scruples about sharing the information or perhaps marketing it, selling it to other countries. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1157.6000000000001s)]
*  The Russians, maybe the Chinese. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1164.6000000000001s)]
*  If they collect information about U.S. intentions, policy intentions toward Moscow or Beijing or Tehran, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1167.6000000000001s)]
*  it would be of interest to those countries. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1174.6000000000001s)]
*  That was this man's job when he was a Cuban intelligence officer decoding messages intercepted from the U.S. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1177.0s)]
*  Jose Cohen defected in 1994. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1184.0s)]
*  Cuba shared that information with enemies of the United States, he told us. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1193.0s)]
*  Countries like the Soviet Union for years, countries like North Korea, countries like Iran, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1197.0s)]
*  had information about the operation of the Defense Department. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1204.4s)]
*  You say Cuba may not have the weapons, Cuba may not have the arms, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1207.4s)]
*  but they sell these secrets to the enemies of the United States. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1212.4s)]
*  The strongest enemies of the United States. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1218.4s)]
*  All of that was what made me realize this is a battle between good and evil. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1221.4s)]
*  Cuba was at the service of all the enemies of the United States. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1225.4s)]
*  After Jose Cohen set foot on U.S. soil, he shared a vital piece of information with the FBI. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1229.8000000000002s)]
*  That led to the investigation of more than 100 suspected Cuban agents and illegal officers [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1236.8000000000002s)]
*  and ultimately one very important spy. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1242.8000000000002s)]
*  Cohen handed over an encryption key like this one used by Cuban spies to send and receive secret messages with Havana. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1245.8000000000002s)]
*  Three nights a week at 9 p.m. and then again at 10, a series of numbered codes was broadcast out of Havana. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1259.8000000000002s)]
*  The signal could be heard for most of the 1990s up the East Coast as far north as Maine, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1270.8000000000002s)]
*  but the coded messages were only meant to be decoded by their agents, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1275.8000000000002s)]
*  including a Pentagon analyst named Ana Montes, who lived in this quiet Washington neighborhood. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1280.8000000000002s)]
*  This is where she did all of the business, all the spy business. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1287.2s)]
*  Exactly. I mean she would listen to the high frequency messages upstairs Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday night. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1290.2s)]
*  She would type up her messages on her computer in her bedroom right up here. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1296.2s)]
*  This is the area that she lived in camouflaged. The fact that she was committing espionage right here. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1300.2s)]
*  He says... [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1306.2s)]
*  Peter Lapp is a retired FBI special agent who was on the team that led the Montes investigation. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1307.2s)]
*  How'd she do it? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1313.2s)]
*  She went to work, memorized three things every day, went home and all classified, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1315.6000000000001s)]
*  and then would write them up or type them up. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1321.6000000000001s)]
*  And then every two or three weeks she would meet in person at lunch, broad daylight, two to three hours over lunch. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1324.6000000000001s)]
*  Maybe I've seen too many movies when I think spies. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1334.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm thinking Dark of Night, Park Bench, secret cameras, fancy gadgets. That wasn't her. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1338.6s)]
*  Everyone who works for the intelligence community goes home with classified information in their head. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1346.6s)]
*  And you can't stop that with guards and technology. It's just, it's undefeatable. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1352.6s)]
*  Lapp wrote a book on the FBI investigation into Montes. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1359.6s)]
*  He told us Havana doesn't pay its spies, so Americans who spy for Cuba don't do it for money, but rather are driven by ideology. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1363.6s)]
*  Ambassador Rocha was recruited in the late 1970s, influenced, he now says, by the radical politics of the day. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1372.6s)]
*  Montes was a student at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in the 1980s, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1380.6s)]
*  and was outspoken about her anger toward U.S. policy in Latin America when she was recruited by a Cuban intelligence officer. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1386.6s)]
*  Montes' father was a U.S. Army doctor, and her siblings worked for the FBI. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1394.6s)]
*  One of her first jobs out of graduate school was as an analyst at the Defense Intelligence Agency. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1399.6s)]
*  So Ana Montes was already a full-fledged Cuban spy from the moment that she set foot inside the Defense Intelligence Agency. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1405.6s)]
*  She walked in fully recruited, day one, only went to DIA for the purpose of spying for the Cubans. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1414.6s)]
*  And when you think about the other folks that have been arrested for espionage, most start loyal. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1420.6s)]
*  They take the oath. They intend to abide by that oath. But then something happens and they flip. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1426.6s)]
*  And Ana's unique in the sense that she walked in from day one and was an insider threat and only went for the purpose of spying for the Cubans. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1433.6s)]
*  How does a Cuban spy walk through the doors of the DIA and get a job? She didn't have to take a polygraph? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1442.6s)]
*  They did not have a polygraph program at the time. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1450.6s)]
*  Over the course of her career, she became such an expert that she was known in the intelligence community as the Queen of Cuba. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1453.6s)]
*  All the while, she was exposing national secrets to Havana. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1461.6s)]
*  The FBI surveilled her for a year before her arrest as she walked to work and called her Cuban handler. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1465.6s)]
*  By that time, she had revealed the existence of a top-secret satellite program used by the U.S. to spy on other countries. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1472.6s)]
*  She also gave Havana the names of 450 American intelligence officials working on Latin American issues, including four undercover officers stationed in Cuba. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1480.6s)]
*  And she got away with it for 17 years until she was arrested in 2001 at her office by FBI Special Agent Peter Lapp and his partner Stephen McCoy. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1491.6s)]
*  She didn't fit the profile of a typical spy. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1502.6s)]
*  No, being a woman is incredibly unique. So it doesn't fit that typical what we would look for in a spy, which is mostly men. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1505.6s)]
*  Montes pleaded guilty to espionage, and in exchange for not spending the rest of her life in prison, she agreed to tell the FBI everything she had done. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1515.6s)]
*  I wouldn't mind at all meeting two Fridays a month. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1524.6s)]
*  Through a public records request, we obtained this footage seen here for the first time of Montes wearing prison stripes speaking with FBI investigators. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1528.6s)]
*  Citing Montes' right to privacy, the FBI denied our request for the recorded audio of their interviews. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1538.6s)]
*  But we obtained a declassified transcript of the first day where Montes described how deep in she was. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1545.6s)]
*  She said, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1551.6s)]
*  I was faithful to principles that were right. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1568.6s)]
*  Montes told the agents her only regret was that she was forced to cooperate with the FBI as part of her plea deal. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1571.6s)]
*  It's tearing me up, she said. But if the only way I'm going to see my family again, it's the only way. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1578.6s)]
*  Agent Lapp sat across from Ana Montes in the interrogation room for seven months. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1586.6s)]
*  He said one of the most sobering moments was when she said how far she would have been willing to go for the Cubans in the week after 9-11. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1591.6s)]
*  She said, if the Cubans asked me to provide them with intelligence about what we were doing in Afghanistan, I absolutely would have done that. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1599.6s)]
*  And if men and women were killed as a result of my intelligence in Afghanistan, she told us that's the risk that they took. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1610.6s)]
*  What was the extent of the damage that she did? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1620.6s)]
*  I do think she's in that tier of some of the most notorious spies in American history. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1623.6s)]
*  And I think the damage that she did was incredibly significant. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1630.6s)]
*  After serving 20 years in federal prison, Ana Montes was released in January 2023. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1635.6s)]
*  She's now living in Puerto Rico where she has family and has been celebrated by some as a hero, seen here recently receiving an award from supporters. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1641.6s)]
*  Through a lawyer, Montes declined our request for an interview. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1650.6s)]
*  Last month, former Ambassador Victor Manuel Rocha told a judge he was deeply sorry and pleaded guilty to acting as an agent of the Cuban government. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1654.6s)]
*  At age 73, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison and is currently cooperating with investigators. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1664.6s)]
*  Just how many state secrets he gave to Cuba, we may never know. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1671.6s)]
*  Nearly all the details of his spy craft remain classified. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1676.6s)]
*  Ana Montes has yet to publicly express any remorse. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1680.6s)]
*  Do you think there are other Ana Montes in the government right now? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1685.6s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1689.6s)]
*  That's chilling. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1691.6s)]
*  There's no doubt that the Cubans and the Russians and others are still penetrating our government with individuals who are loyal to them and not to us. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1692.6s)]
*  By the time a new play opened last week off Broadway by acclaimed writer and director Moises Kaufman, it had already been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1704.6s)]
*  It's based on the true story of a photo album from Auschwitz that was sent to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. in 2007. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1724.6s)]
*  Museum historians weren't sure what to make of it at first, but the album turned out to be the scrapbook of a Nazi, an SS officer who helped run the day-to-day operations of Auschwitz, where about 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were murdered between 1940 and 1945. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1733.6s)]
*  The album doesn't show any prisoners or gas chambers. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1752.6s)]
*  What it does show are some of the most notorious killers in history seemingly enjoying themselves. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1756.6s)]
*  That's what museum officials found so chilling and what Moises Kaufman spent 14 years creating a play about. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1762.6s)]
*  When I first saw the photographs, I got goosebumps. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1769.6s)]
*  And I remember thinking, you know, many of the people in my family died in Auschwitz, and these are the people who were doing it. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1774.6s)]
*  And they don't seem to have any remorse. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1783.6s)]
*  Seeing that in a photograph so clearly articulated is terrifying. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1786.6s)]
*  This is terrifying because they all look so much like us. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1790.6s)]
*  The photographs may appear unremarkable at first, SS officers at dinner parties drinking, socializing, flirting with their young Nazi secretaries. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1795.6s)]
*  But when these pictures were taken, the Germans were losing the war and exterminating more Jews in Auschwitz than at any other time in the Holocaust. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1805.6s)]
*  Several images show an SS officer giving his secretaries blueberries while a man plays an accordion. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1814.6s)]
*  The inscription reads, Here there are blueberries. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1821.6s)]
*  Moises Kaufman picked that for the title of his play. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1825.6s)]
*  I wanted the audience to have the experience that we had looking at the photographs. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1828.6s)]
*  What was it about the series of the women eating blueberries that that so struck you? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1834.6s)]
*  That there were just, you know, teenage girls who were secretaries. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1838.6s)]
*  Everyone is showing the photographer their empty plates. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1843.6s)]
*  But there's one of the women who pretend crying. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1846.6s)]
*  So she's so sad because she's run out of blueberries. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1849.6s)]
*  And outside of the frame, there's 1.1 million people who are being killed. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1852.6s)]
*  So how do you lead your daily life and at the same time participate in one of the largest killing machines in the history of mankind? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1858.6s)]
*  Kaufman's play is centered on the museum historians who worked with survivors and even descendants of Nazis themselves to uncover what the album was. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1871.6s)]
*  The images appear to be straight out of a holiday scrapbook. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1890.6s)]
*  No one had ever seen images like these before. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1894.6s)]
*  There are few photos of Auschwitz because the Nazis worked hard to conceal their crimes. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1897.6s)]
*  I count 116 photographs. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1902.6s)]
*  Kaufman's main character is Rebecca Uebelding, a historian at the Holocaust Museum, played by actor Elizabeth Stallman. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1906.6s)]
*  This is when the album becomes an obsession for me. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1913.6s)]
*  The real Rebecca Uebelding received the album from a former U.S. counterintelligence officer. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1918.6s)]
*  He said he found it in 1946 in an abandoned apartment in war-torn Frankfurt while hunting down Nazi war criminals. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1924.6s)]
*  He donated it to the museum but wanted to remain anonymous. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1932.6s)]
*  How did you go about finding out who made this? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1936.6s)]
*  I didn't see any trains. I didn't see anything I recognized. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1939.6s)]
*  It was maybe the third time flipping through it. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1941.6s)]
*  And that's when I saw Joseph Mengele. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1944.6s)]
*  No pictures of Dr. Joseph Mengele in Auschwitz had ever been found before. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1946.6s)]
*  To see the album, we went to a high-security, climate-controlled facility in Maryland where the original pages are stored. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1952.6s)]
*  That's Dr. Mengele. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1960.6s)]
*  That's Mengele. And these are still the only known photos of Mengele while he was stationed at the camp. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1961.6s)]
*  Mengele was known by prisoners at Auschwitz as the angel of death. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1966.6s)]
*  He conducted gruesome medical experiments, mostly on children, and often stood on the platform when trains arrived, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1971.6s)]
*  selecting who would be sent to work and who would die immediately in gas chambers. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1978.6s)]
*  Not only is it Mengele, these are some of the most infamous officers at the camp. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1983.6s)]
*  So you see there's Baer. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1988.6s)]
*  Richard Baer is on the album's first page. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1989.6s)]
*  He was the last commandant of Auschwitz. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1992.6s)]
*  That helped historians identify his deputy, Karl Hocker. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1994.6s)]
*  And it turned out this was Hocker's personal album, his cherished memories behind the scenes of a massacre. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=1998.6s)]
*  May 1944 is when Hocker got to Auschwitz. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2005.6s)]
*  Yes. So this is the entirety of his time at Auschwitz. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2008.6s)]
*  Before the war, Hocker had been a struggling bank teller. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2011.6s)]
*  Becoming an SS officer at Auschwitz was considered a big step up. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2014.6s)]
*  He had been staffed at the Majdanek camp before this. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2019.6s)]
*  And so he had experience with prisoners arriving, with selections, with gas chambers. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2022.6s)]
*  He signed receipts for Zyklon B, the lethal gas that was used for killing people. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2027.6s)]
*  He is a crucial cog in the Nazi killing machine. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2033.6s)]
*  The 116 photos in the album show Auschwitz as Karl Hocker wanted to remember it. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2036.6s)]
*  It's a mix of like candid things and really officials. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2043.6s)]
*  This is his dog. His dog's name is Favreit. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2047.6s)]
*  I mean, what's so stunning about them is how... [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2049.6s)]
*  Normal? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2052.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2053.6s)]
*  I mean, who hasn't taken a photo of them shaking their dog's hand? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2054.6s)]
*  So this is Yule Fire 1944, which is Nazi Christmas. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2058.6s)]
*  They know that the Soviets are coming. They are not far. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2062.6s)]
*  They can probably hear the bombs. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2065.6s)]
*  And they're lighting Christmas. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2067.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2068.6s)]
*  The album reveals something else museum officials hadn't seen before. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2069.6s)]
*  The Nazis built a vacation resort at Auschwitz. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2073.6s)]
*  It was called Sulahuta. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2076.6s)]
*  These pictures show a gathering of top SS officers there in July 1944. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2079.6s)]
*  Rebecca Rebelding believes it was a party. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2084.6s)]
*  They were congratulating themselves for successfully murdering [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2087.6s)]
*  more than 350,000 Hungarian Jews in just 55 days. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2090.6s)]
*  This looks like they're singing. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2096.6s)]
*  They are. And this front row is really what the director of the museum, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2097.6s)]
*  Sarah Bloomfield, calls the chorus of criminals. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2101.6s)]
*  So you have Hocker, you have Otto Moll, the head of the gas chamber section. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2103.6s)]
*  There's Rudolf HÃ¶rst. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2108.6s)]
*  The former commandant of Auschwitz. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2109.6s)]
*  The former commandant of Auschwitz. Mengele is here. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2111.6s)]
*  They're celebrating the successful slaughter. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2114.6s)]
*  The successful mass murder. Yeah. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2116.6s)]
*  And then, you know, it was somebody labeled at the metropolis of death. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2118.6s)]
*  And that's what it was. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2124.6s)]
*  It worked like an assembly line factory. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2126.6s)]
*  Irene Weiss got to Auschwitz the day after Karl Hocker started working there. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2130.6s)]
*  She arrived when she was 13 on a train packed with Jews from Hungary. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2135.6s)]
*  Separated from her parents and four of her siblings, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2140.6s)]
*  she says she found herself on the platform holding her younger sister Edith's hand [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2143.6s)]
*  as they approached Dr. Mengele. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2148.6s)]
*  And everything was a matter of seconds. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2150.6s)]
*  You know, that stick came down between us. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2154.6s)]
*  He held life and death with that stick. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2157.6s)]
*  All of a sudden, I was alone. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2160.6s)]
*  She didn't know it at the time, but that moment was captured by a Nazi photographer [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2162.6s)]
*  documenting the arrival and processing of Hungarian Jews. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2166.6s)]
*  It appears in one of the only other albums of Auschwitz. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2170.6s)]
*  This photo has been colorized. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2174.6s)]
*  This is the group already going to the gas chamber. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2176.6s)]
*  Where are you in this picture? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2179.6s)]
*  Well, I am right here. This is you? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2181.6s)]
*  That's me right here. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2183.6s)]
*  So this is the moment after you've been separated from your little sister Edith? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2184.6s)]
*  The very moment, yes. That's what I'm looking at. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2188.6s)]
*  I can't leave. I left her. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2191.6s)]
*  Irene Weiss never saw Edith, her parents, or her brothers alive again. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2193.6s)]
*  What she has is this photo. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2198.6s)]
*  That's her mother, Lea, sitting on the ground [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2200.6s)]
*  just behind her brothers Gershon and Rubin at Auschwitz. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2203.6s)]
*  After this picture was taken, they were led into a gas chamber. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2207.6s)]
*  They had to kill the children so there would not be a new generation. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2211.6s)]
*  And they discovered that if they also killed the mothers, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2215.6s)]
*  then they didn't have to worry about the chaos that that would create separating them. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2220.6s)]
*  The children wouldn't be upset by being separated. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2227.6s)]
*  And the mothers wouldn't be upset. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2229.6s)]
*  Weiss spent the next eight months working outside one of those gas chambers. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2232.6s)]
*  She sorted shoes and other belongings of the dead. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2236.6s)]
*  We saw these columns of women, mothers and children, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2240.6s)]
*  going into the door there, talking to us, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2245.6s)]
*  and they're told they're walking into a bathhouse. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2250.6s)]
*  They're asking questions, where are you from? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2253.6s)]
*  And a half hour later, the chimney is belching fire. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2256.6s)]
*  And that went on day after day and night after night. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2261.6s)]
*  So you saw thousands of women, children, walking into gas chambers. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2266.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2272.6s)]
*  And you talked to some of them. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2273.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2274.6s)]
*  In the last seconds of their life, minutes of their lives. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2275.6s)]
*  Yes, but we couldn't cry. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2277.6s)]
*  It was an amazing thing. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2279.6s)]
*  This is beyond crying. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2282.6s)]
*  Tears are for normal pain. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2284.6s)]
*  That kind of brutality from fellow mankind is so deep that, you know, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2288.6s)]
*  people say broken heart. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2296.6s)]
*  The heart keeps working. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2299.6s)]
*  But the soul never forgets. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2303.6s)]
*  Irene Weiss wasn't surprised by the photos in Carl Hocker's album. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2307.6s)]
*  But when they were released publicly, they made headlines around the world. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2311.6s)]
*  Tillman Taub read about them online in Germany while on his lunch break. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2315.6s)]
*  And there was an article, new photos from Auschwitz have appeared. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2320.6s)]
*  I thought, this is interesting. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2325.6s)]
*  When he looked at the photos, he was surprised to see his grandfather, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2326.6s)]
*  Dr. Heinz Baumkotter. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2330.6s)]
*  On the first picture, it wasn't 100% clear, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2332.6s)]
*  but then I flipped two more pictures and it was absolutely 100% clear that that was him. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2334.6s)]
*  Taub knew his grandfather was head physician at Sachsenhausen concentration camp [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2340.6s)]
*  and had done medical experiments on prisoners and sent thousands to be killed at other camps. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2345.6s)]
*  But Taub wasn't sure why his grandfather had gone to Auschwitz. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2350.6s)]
*  He connected with Rebecca Uebelding and soon discovered just how deeply involved his grandfather was in the Holocaust. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2354.6s)]
*  When you see the picture of your grandfather, does that feel like your grandfather? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2362.6s)]
*  For me, strictly speaking, it's two different persons. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2365.6s)]
*  The grandfather that I knew was a rather normal grandfather. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2368.6s)]
*  And the SS officer is a different person for me. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2372.6s)]
*  It's impossible to reconcile the two. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2375.6s)]
*  It's difficult, difficult, really. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2377.6s)]
*  Taub now helps the museum search for more photos and documents by reaching out to other descendants of Nazis. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2379.6s)]
*  Of course, you want to be part of some kind of movement that helps preventing things like that from happening again. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2386.6s)]
*  You know your grandfather and you know what he did. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2394.6s)]
*  Does it make you think differently about human beings, what we are all capable of? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2397.6s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2400.6s)]
*  How could highly educated physicians, people whose entire professional purpose was to heal, become systematic killers? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2402.6s)]
*  The play about the Hawker album by Moises Kaufman and Amanda Gronick, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2411.6s)]
*  his co-writer and longtime collaborator, raises difficult questions, not just about our past, but about ourselves. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2416.6s)]
*  When we look at these pictures, we're looking through the lens of how they saw what they were doing. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2424.6s)]
*  Why is it important to see Auschwitz through their eyes? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2432.6s)]
*  Because they didn't wake up each morning thinking, I'm an evil monster. I'm going to do evil, monstrous things. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2435.6s)]
*  They woke up each day and they went about their lives filled with justifications and beliefs in what they were doing. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2440.6s)]
*  It makes all of us ask the question, well, what am I capable of doing? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2448.6s)]
*  I think that's what's happening. When the audience comes in, they sit here and they go, who would I have been in that picture? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2452.6s)]
*  The most dangerous animal in the world is man, because other animals will hurt you if they're hungry or it's their nature of hunting. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2458.6s)]
*  But man can turn into an animal in no time. All he needs is permission. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2472.6s)]
*  As soon as permission is given from higher up, from government, it accelerates. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2481.6s)]
*  Even a hint of permission, that it's okay to attack this group or exclude this group or shame that group, it's happening. It's never stopped. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2487.6s)]
*  Now, the last minute of 60 minutes. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2500.6s)]
*  Tonight, a farewell to our 56th season and to Frank Devine, who made 60 Minutes better for 35 years. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2512.6s)]
*  Frank is retiring as a senior producer who improved the writing of every 60-minute story. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2522.6s)]
*  As a producer for Steve Croft, Frank explained the 2008 financial crisis, introduced us to an unknown Illinois senator named Barack Obama, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2528.6s)]
*  and produced an almost unheard of interview with then-Charles Prince of Wales. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2539.6s)]
*  Now, we must return our colleague to his family. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2546.6s)]
*  We will remember Frank for his generous and learned presence, and our audience is in the debt of a journalist who believes facts are facts, and writing fills them with meaning. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2550.6s)]
*  We may not see his byline, L. Franklin Devine, here again, but his inspiration endures. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2562.6s)]
*  Thank you, Frank. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2570.6s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. We'll be back in September with a brand new season of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtVRu6W1sY&t=2572.6s)]
