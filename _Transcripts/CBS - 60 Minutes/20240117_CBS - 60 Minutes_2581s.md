*  City office buildings are in trouble. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=119.92s)]
*  For a century, the towers have been propped up by two pillars. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=122.28s)]
*  One, workers filling the buildings all week. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=125.36s)]
*  Two, money flowing freely in the form of loans to borrow, buy, and build. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=128.24s)]
*  Those days are over. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  As hybrid work hardens from trend to new normal, office occupancy rates have hit all-time lows. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=134.84s)]
*  Meanwhile interest rates have spiked to historic highs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=140.48s)]
*  And now the mortgage comes due. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=143.28s)]

*  But peek inside all this vertical real estate and there's a fundamental question. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=171.06s)]
*  Where is everyone? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=176.26s)]
*  More than 95 million square feet of New York office space currently unoccupied. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=178.01999999999998s)]

*  Scott Reckler is CEO of RXR, a New York real estate company with more than $20 billion [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=189.94000000000003s)]
*  in holdings. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=195.5s)]
*  We walk through his property at 61 Broadway near Wall Street. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  Every other floor, half the building, lies empty. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=200.86s)]
*  I think this is an existential moment. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=203.9s)]
*  I call it crossing the chasm. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=205.78s)]
*  What's the chasm specifically? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  This post-COVID world of higher interest rates, the changing nature of how people work and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=209.26000000000002s)]
*  live. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=213.9s)]
*  We're not going back to where we were. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=214.9s)]
*  It's a different world. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=215.9s)]
*  And it's going to be turbulent. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=216.9s)]
*  It already is. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=218.73999999999998s)]
*  The return to office has stalled out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=220.22s)]
*  Fridays are dead. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=223.26s)]
*  Mondays aren't much busier. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=224.26s)]
*  As tenants shrink their office footprint, office landlords are confronting the fact [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=226.5s)]
*  that some of their buildings have become obsolete, if not worthless. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=230.85999999999999s)]
*  Ever the pragmatist, Reckler decided not to throw good money after bad at 61 Broadway [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=234.89999999999998s)]
*  and defaulted to his bank on a $240 million loan. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=240.22s)]
*  I could see people saying, it's a lot of money. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=244.89999999999998s)]
*  How did he sleep last night? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=246.98s)]
*  We invest a lot of equity. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  If it works, we make a lot of money. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  If it doesn't work, the lender can take over the building. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=251.66s)]
*  You got to face reality, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=256.18s)]
*  Reality is coming your way. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=258.06s)]
*  The reality is the price of office buildings is tanking, as much as 40 percent since the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  pandemic. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=264.26s)]
*  Uptown at Columbia Business School, Stan Van Neuwerberg, a professor of real estate, has [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=265.66s)]
*  modeled out the impact of hybrid work on pricing and calls it a train wreck in slow motion. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=270.26s)]
*  And this is just the beginning. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=276.42s)]
*  The reason it's just the beginning is because there's a lot of office tenants that have [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=277.82s)]
*  not had to make an active space decision yet. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=281.86s)]
*  Do I want to renew the space? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=285.06s)]
*  Do I want to vacate? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=286.5s)]
*  Maybe I'll sign a new lease for half as much space. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=287.82s)]
*  This is what tenants have been doing for the last three years. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=290.42s)]
*  So when you take all of those current and future declines of cash flows into account, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=293.18s)]
*  we end up with about a 40 percent reduction in the value of these offices. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=297.7s)]
*  Consider this office building near Penn Station, one of a handful of sales in the city last [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=302.62s)]
*  fall. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=307.3s)]
*  Built in 1920 and showing its age, eight empty floors with a 99 cent store on the ground [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=308.3s)]
*  level. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=314.5s)]
*  Cocoa butter is 80 percent off. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=315.5s)]
*  Real estate partners Tony Park and Alad Dror told us they'd been eyeing that building for [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=317.5s)]
*  years and, pre-pandemic, offered the owner $80 million. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=322.1s)]
*  They didn't get very far. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=326.74s)]
*  He doesn't answer. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=327.74s)]
*  He didn't even answer you guys. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=328.74s)]
*  He didn't answer, yeah. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=329.74s)]
*  We didn't have his attention at all. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=330.74s)]
*  So what do you think happened? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=334.1s)]
*  The whole building is now empty. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=335.1s)]
*  In September, Park and Dror got the building for less than half their original offer. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=337.5s)]
*  And they have plans to convert the place. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=342.61999999999995s)]
*  Did you ever think of just keeping it as an office building? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=345.97999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=349.17999999999995s)]
*  Never. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=350.17999999999995s)]
*  You laugh. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=351.17999999999995s)]
*  Anything that is not an office. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=352.17999999999995s)]
*  Anything that is not an office. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=353.94s)]
*  Miss Holloway, good morning. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=355.97999999999996s)]
*  So much for the prestige Hollywood has for decades conferred on Manhattan office life. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  Suffice to say they didn't set Mad Men in succession above a 99-cent store. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=362.94s)]
*  It has gotten weird. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=366.82s)]
*  It has gotten very weird. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=367.82s)]
*  But you might set a glitzy office drama in a place like this, one Vanderbilt, part of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=370.62s)]
*  a crop of so-called trophy buildings, one resilient sliver of this changing real estate [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=375.46s)]
*  market. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=380.9s)]
*  To the very, very top. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=381.9s)]
*  Mark Holloway is CEO of SL Green, New York's biggest office landlord, also the 60 Minutes [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=383.7s)]
*  landlord. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=389.54s)]
*  He took us to the top of his new $3 billion skyscraper. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=390.54s)]

*  And now the office owner. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=509.8s)]
*  They've got a choice to make. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=510.8s)]

*  The rubber meets the road when it comes time to refinance. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=517.4s)]
*  And to make matters worse, interest rates are now much higher. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=520.4s)]
*  Interest rates have essentially doubled, so the cost of that new mortgage, even if you [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=522.96s)]
*  can get one, will be much higher. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=526.32s)]

*  A mortgage foreclosure on an office building. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=539.0s)]
*  Here no one in the crowd is willing to outbid the bank holding the loan on the building. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=547.76s)]
*  And if the bank rep doesn't look thrilled, it's because he has an empty office building [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=552.72s)]
*  dragging down his balance sheets. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=556.88s)]

*  Reserve on this very point. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=563.36s)]
*  So commercial real estate is a huge part of the book of business of your typical bank. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=565.76s)]
*  And I'm talking mostly about these smaller and medium sized, maybe regional banks. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=570.96s)]
*  They have a lot of exposure. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=574.6800000000001s)]
*  That is their bread and butter activity. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=576.22s)]

*  And here we are sort of seeing weakness in office that is something that we have never [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=581.4200000000001s)]
*  seen before. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  And banks need to come to grips with that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=587.32s)]
*  Are you comfortable calling this a crisis? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=589.0400000000001s)]

*  There is a potential crisis here. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=592.2800000000001s)]
*  In December, nationwide office loan delinquency rates crowded 6%, almost four times what they [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=594.44s)]
*  were a year ago. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=600.0400000000001s)]
*  But banks have been reluctant to write down those losses. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=601.44s)]
*  Enter David Avaram from Maverick Real Estate, a firm he and his partner founded after the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  2008 financial crisis. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=610.6400000000001s)]
*  Their specialty? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=612.6800000000001s)]
*  Buying distressed debt on the cheap. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=613.9200000000001s)]
*  Avaram keeps tabs on the debt on every office building in the city. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=616.36s)]
*  He says New York is awash in billions worth of commercial real estate loans at risk of [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=620.32s)]
*  not being paid. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=624.44s)]
*  We know that there's this buildup of bad debt in the system, but it's not being dealt with [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=626.12s)]
*  just yet. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=632.5200000000001s)]
*  And it's in large part because the banks have been kicking the can down the road as best [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=633.5200000000001s)]
*  they can, trying to push this off as far as they can. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=638.24s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=642.36s)]
*  It means that banks are entering into extensions on a lot of their bad loans, which essentially [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=643.98s)]
*  change their classification from a non-performing loan, a loan that's in distress, to a performing [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=650.4200000000001s)]
*  loan, a healthy loan, even though they haven't received a pay down on the loan and the collateral [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=656.22s)]
*  value on that loan continues to drop. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=661.96s)]
*  Extend and pretend. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=664.4200000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=665.6s)]
*  And it works really well when interest rates are low because the banks can just keep the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=666.6s)]
*  status quo going, but once rates are high, it doesn't really work anymore. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=672.02s)]
*  A downturn in real estate, made worse by bad loans, contaminating banks and potentially [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=677.9s)]
*  the entire economy, echoes of the global financial crisis of 2008 are hard to ignore. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=683.26s)]
*  But whether the trouble with office buildings ends in a simple pricing correction or becomes [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=689.86s)]
*  a systemic crisis, likely there's pain coming, not just for building owners and banks, but [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=694.8s)]
*  for cities themselves. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=700.7s)]
*  In the long run, property taxes on those buildings will also fall by 40 percent. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=702.9000000000001s)]
*  And these commercial property tax revenues are an important component of the budget of [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=708.5s)]
*  local governments, which means less money for police departments, trash collection, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=712.14s)]
*  and some people are going to decide that the quality of life has deteriorated too much [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=717.0200000000001s)]
*  and they want out. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=721.64s)]
*  And in fact, that's what we've seen. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=722.9000000000001s)]
*  In the last three years, about our largest ten cities have lost about two million residents. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=724.22s)]
*  You're losing that tax base as well. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=729.02s)]
*  And now you're losing that tax base. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=730.8199999999999s)]
*  And now this cycle continues. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=732.48s)]
*  And we end up in something that we have called an urban doom loop. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=734.48s)]
*  It's awfully quiet around here. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=738.1s)]

*  You take the center section of the office floor, the part that doesn't get a lot of [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=807.0s)]
*  light and air, seal it up, and preserve that square footage so you can apply it somewhere [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=810.5s)]
*  more valuable, say a penthouse. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=815.58s)]

*  doctor involved, Dr. Ali Rezai, who 60 Minutes first met 20 years ago. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=938.78s)]
*  Dr. Rezai is a neuroscience pioneer who's developed treatments for Parkinson's disease [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=944.5799999999999s)]
*  and other brain disorders. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=950.38s)]
*  Over the last year, we followed this master of the mind as he attempted to delay the progression [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=952.78s)]
*  of Alzheimer's disease and its worst symptoms using ultrasound. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=958.28s)]
*  We saw a cutting edge approach to brain surgery with no cutting. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=963.04s)]
*  If we can, we should not be doing brain surgery. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=967.76s)]
*  You're a brain surgeon. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=970.16s)]
*  I am, but I should be out of a job because brain surgery, it's cutting the skin, opening [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=971.24s)]
*  the skull. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=976.24s)]
*  It can be barbaric. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=977.3199999999999s)]
*  You're going to go right in there. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=978.3199999999999s)]
*  It looked like a scene from a sci-fi movie. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=981.04s)]
*  A halo-wrapped patient pushed into a tube as a team of doctors manipulate his brain [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=984.44s)]
*  from the other side of the glass. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=991.6s)]
*  Gain high, modulate power, three minutes, okay, we're ready to go. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=993.2s)]
*  Dr. Ali Rezai allowed us to witness his revolutionary attempt to use ultrasound to slow down the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=997.0s)]
*  cognitive decline in three patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1003.1600000000001s)]
*  It's never been done before. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1008.0400000000001s)]
*  There's no miracle cure here. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1010.12s)]
*  It's advancing medicine with calculated risks and pushing the frontiers. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1011.96s)]
*  So we're targeting these areas. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1015.88s)]
*  Dr. Rezai and his team are focused on these red patches in the patient's brain scans. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1017.48s)]
*  The red indicates the densest beta amyloid protein. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1023.2800000000001s)]
*  That gummy protein is believed to play a major role in Alzheimer's by disrupting communication [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1027.28s)]
*  between brain cells. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1033.08s)]
*  In people with Alzheimer's, it accumulates much faster. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1035.2s)]
*  And over time, these protein aggregates, we call them plaques, like plaques in the [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1039.12s)]
*  arteries, they keep on accumulating and impacting function. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1045.08s)]
*  There are two FDA-approved drugs on the market that can help break up that brain plaque. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1049.56s)]
*  Adacanumab was approved in 2021, followed by Licanumab last year. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1054.8799999999999s)]
*  Both are given intravenously, but they work slowly. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1060.9199999999998s)]
*  Typically, you go into the clinic and you get an IV and you have the antibody infusion [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1065.76s)]
*  over one to two hours. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1071.28s)]
*  And you have to do it once a month or twice a month for 18 months and longer. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1073.36s)]
*  And during those 12 to 18 months, the brain is continuing to progress. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1077.82s)]
*  Alzheimer's is not going away. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1082.1599999999999s)]
*  It takes so long because the drugs have a hard time getting through something called [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1084.4399999999998s)]
*  the blood-brain barrier. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1088.52s)]
*  This tight filter of cells lined the blood vessels to keep toxins from leaking into [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1090.54s)]
*  the brain, but it also prevents almost all of the medication from getting into. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1095.26s)]
*  We think that that's what's causing the baby disruption by opening this here. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1100.98s)]
*  Dr. Rezai thought he could solve that problem with ultrasound, the same technology that's [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1104.06s)]
*  been used for 70 years to give doctors a view of organs and fetal development. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1109.34s)]
*  He chose ultrasound because it easily penetrates the skull and can be focused, like sunlight [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1116.58s)]
*  through a magnifying glass, to help open the blood-brain barrier and allow the drugs to [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1122.78s)]
*  rush in. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1128.02s)]
*  This way, we're getting the payload, the therapeutic payload, exactly to the area it needs to go [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1129.02s)]
*  with a high penetration. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1134.26s)]
*  But we've got to be careful because we want to be safe about this. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1135.26s)]
*  You don't want to deliver too much. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1138.3s)]
*  You don't want to open the blood-brain barrier too much. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1139.3s)]
*  Because if you open it too much, what could happen? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1141.9399999999998s)]
*  You can get bleeding in the brain. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1143.62s)]
*  You can get swelling in the brain. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1144.62s)]
*  You can get many other problems. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1146.46s)]
*  So you have to get it just right. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1148.38s)]
*  We will show you exactly how that worked and the early results in a minute. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1150.5s)]
*  But to understand why one of the country's most accomplished brain surgeons is betting [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1155.1000000000001s)]
*  on ultrasound, you have to go back to 2002, when Dr. Rezai first caught our attention [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1159.64s)]
*  in a story Morley Safer reported on treating Parkinson's disease. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1167.4s)]
*  Look up. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1171.8600000000001s)]
*  Show me your teeth. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1172.8600000000001s)]
*  Stick a tongue out. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1173.8600000000001s)]
*  Very good. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1174.8600000000001s)]
*  Dr. Rezai was among the first to implant a pacemaker-type device in the brain which [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1176.26s)]
*  stopped uncontrollable movements suffered by Parkinson's patients. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1181.86s)]
*  It's like traveling through a labyrinth, as in the Greek myth. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1185.8999999999999s)]
*  Around every quarter you have that blood-thirsty monster that can jump on you. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1190.34s)]
*  So you want to be careful to avoid these areas. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1193.82s)]
*  That kind of implant surgery is now routine for advanced Parkinson's. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1196.74s)]
*  Dr. Rezai went on to write hundreds of scientific papers, secure dozens of patents and present [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1201.1799999999998s)]
*  his Parkinson's research to Congress and the White House. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1206.78s)]
*  He could have gone to any big city research center, but, true to form, he chose to try [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1210.1799999999998s)]
*  something different and moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, where he is the executive director [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1215.06s)]
*  of the Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1220.98s)]
*  It was a fantastic move because we're able to achieve so many things that would have [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1224.02s)]
*  been difficult at other institutions. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1227.34s)]
*  Sometimes in the bigger institutions you may not be hungry as much for it. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1230.1s)]
*  You may have a thousand different agendas and priorities. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1232.9399999999998s)]
*  Here we think we have a very nimble and agile team that can quickly get outcomes. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1237.3s)]
*  Like in 2019, this is video Dr. Rezai's team took when they were among the first to use [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1241.9399999999998s)]
*  ultrasound to treat tremors. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1247.62s)]
*  For 15 years, Dan Wall had been suffering from essential tremor, a neurological disorder. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1250.06s)]
*  You okay? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1255.58s)]
*  You got a hat on now. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1256.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1257.58s)]
*  All right, very good. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1258.58s)]
*  His team focused ultrasound into a part of the brain called the thalamus to destroy a [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1259.58s)]
*  pinpoint-sized patch of tissue doctors believed was responsible for the tremors. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1265.1399999999999s)]
*  There's like 980 elements converging right there. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1270.5s)]
*  Wall was awake during the procedure. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1274.1799999999998s)]
*  After two hours, the 71-year-old's tremor was gone. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1278.46s)]
*  I'm feeling afraid I'm on drop. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1282.22s)]
*  You got it. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1284.22s)]
*  I've got it. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1285.22s)]
*  Really good. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1286.22s)]
*  Do you want to show off? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1287.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1288.22s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1290.22s)]
*  Praise the Lord. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1291.22s)]
*  That success helped convince Dr. Rezai that focused ultrasound could be adapted to patients [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1294.42s)]
*  with other brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1300.14s)]
*  My first symptoms that I noticed were that I was having trouble typing at work. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1304.54s)]
*  Did you think you had Alzheimer's? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1310.94s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1312.46s)]
*  Dan Miller is just 61 years old. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1314.1000000000001s)]
*  His wife Kathy began noticing changes four years ago. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1317.04s)]
*  He kind of hit it pretty well. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1320.76s)]
*  And then I noticed he was having trouble, his clothes would be backwards and those kinds [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1322.8s)]
*  of things. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1329.48s)]
*  Just little things. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1330.48s)]
*  Just little things, yes. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1331.48s)]
*  A scan of his brain revealed what Dan had been hiding. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1332.48s)]
*  Mr. Miller had very large amounts of beta amyloid. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1336.48s)]
*  The red spots indicated a buildup of those beta amyloid proteins, the so-called brain [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1340.04s)]
*  plaque, a marker of Alzheimer's. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1346.0s)]
*  Dr. Rezai explained to Miller he couldn't cure him of the disease, but he hoped to slow [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1348.28s)]
*  its progression. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1353.2s)]
*  Why take part in the trial if it's not a cure? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1355.6399999999999s)]
*  I have to explain to you that I was at the point, you know, like in Dante's Inferno, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1359.04s)]
*  where it says, abandon all hope, you who enter here. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1364.84s)]
*  For me, it was just, you know, let's do this, you know. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1368.32s)]
*  What do I have to lose? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1371.48s)]
*  And you are infused, sir. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1373.0s)]
*  Here's how it worked. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1374.6s)]
*  Hours before the procedure, Miller was given an IV treatment of adacanumab, one of those [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1376.12s)]
*  two new drugs to reduce beta amyloid plaque. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1381.28s)]
*  Miller was then fitted with this million-dollar helmet, similar to the one the team used to [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1386.32s)]
*  treat tremor patients. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1391.2s)]
*  It directs nearly a thousand beams of ultrasound energy at a target the size of a pencil point. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1393.24s)]
*  Basically, the patient lies on the MRI table and the head goes inside the helmet. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1400.04s)]
*  And the patient is immobilized with a halo or with a mouthpiece because we don't want [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1406.2s)]
*  movements to cause errors in our targeting in the brain. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1410.72s)]
*  Is that comfortable? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1413.92s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1414.92s)]
*  It pops out? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1415.92s)]
*  Once inside, the MRI machine gave Dr. Rezai a 3D view of the plaque he would target in [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1416.92s)]
*  Dan Miller's brain. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1422.2s)]
*  The next step was an IV solution that contained microscopic bubbles. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1424.04s)]
*  When hit with ultrasound energy, the bubbles pry open that blood-brain barrier. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1428.68s)]
*  Okay, ready. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1433.4s)]
*  We can sonicate now. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1434.64s)]
*  There we go. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1435.64s)]
*  The bubbles start vibrating. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1438.88s)]
*  They're moving. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1440.8400000000001s)]
*  They're moving. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1441.8400000000001s)]
*  They start expanding. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1442.8400000000001s)]
*  So you can open the barrier temporarily. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1443.8400000000001s)]
*  Now it's open for 24 to 48 hours, and then it reseals. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1448.44s)]
*  So this gives you a tremendous opportunity for 24 to 48 hours with the barrier being [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1452.72s)]
*  open so now therapeutists can get inside the brain. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1458.0s)]
*  You can't hear ultrasound. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1463.1599999999999s)]
*  That noise is a signal to tell Rezai's team the ultrasound is doing its work. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1464.9199999999998s)]
*  Very nice opening of the blood-brain barrier. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1470.3999999999999s)]
*  Each dot represents an area where all the waves, all the ultrasound waves converge and [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1474.28s)]
*  open the blood-brain barrier. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1479.48s)]
*  So this is just one blast, if you will? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1480.6399999999999s)]
*  One blast getting there. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1483.12s)]
*  And you're hitting one point. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1484.48s)]
*  One point and then it moves to the next one. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1486.32s)]
*  Even though patients were awake, they told us they didn't feel a thing. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1490.04s)]
*  It all took a couple of hours and they went home when it was over. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1493.9199999999998s)]
*  The three patients were given the treatments of ultrasound with infusion once month over [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1497.9199999999998s)]
*  six months. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1502.52s)]
*  That's another target right there. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1503.52s)]
*  The result? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1504.84s)]
*  Beta amyloid plaque targeted with ultrasound were reduced 50% more than areas treated by [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1505.84s)]
*  infusion alone. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1512.72s)]
*  Dr. Rezai shared the three patients' brain scans with us. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1515.64s)]
*  And the red indicates more density of beta amyloid plaques in the brain. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1519.68s)]
*  So you can see as you treat it with ultrasound. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1524.8000000000002s)]
*  Look closely at the areas outlined in white that were targeted with ultrasound and the [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1526.92s)]
*  drug. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1531.3200000000002s)]
*  You get reduction right there. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1532.3200000000002s)]
*  That's after you can see the plaques are very significantly reduced by opening the blood-brain [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1534.6000000000001s)]
*  barrier just in one area. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1539.4s)]
*  Ready? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1541.2800000000002s)]
*  Have your lay back. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1542.2800000000002s)]
*  Ian Miller and the third patient in the trial had larger areas of their brain targeted with [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1543.3999999999999s)]
*  ultrasound. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1548.04s)]
*  And this is his baseline and then you can see here after 26 weeks there's a very dramatic [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1549.16s)]
*  reduction in the beta amyloid in the areas as outlined by this white mark. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1555.54s)]
*  And now we're going to look at patient number three. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1562.28s)]
*  And this patient underwent antibody infusion therapy plus ultrasound. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1564.8799999999999s)]
*  You can see this area which is really amazing. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1569.52s)]
*  The ultrasound opened the blood-brain barrier and the antibody went in faster and cleaned [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1572.78s)]
*  out the plaques. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1577.42s)]
*  What was your reaction when you saw this scan? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1578.66s)]
*  I mean my jaw dropped out. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1580.82s)]
*  I'm like whoa. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1582.46s)]
*  I was actually even in the clinic seeing patients and the PET scan technician called and said [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1583.46s)]
*  oh yeah there's a big change. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1588.3s)]
*  I'm like how do you know? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1589.98s)]
*  We have to analyze it. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1590.98s)]
*  He's like no you can see it on the screen. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1591.98s)]
*  What did you think when Dr. Rezai shared the scans with you? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1594.06s)]
*  It was surreal. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1601.02s)]
*  You can really see it. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1602.66s)]
*  You don't have to be a doctor to understand what's going on there. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1604.26s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1606.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1607.46s)]
*  Even the res decreasing. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1608.46s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1609.46s)]
*  Kathy Miller says she can see it in her husband too who slips up once in a while but hasn't [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1610.46s)]
*  slipped further away. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1616.24s)]
*  He has trouble finding things. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1617.94s)]
*  I'll send him into the kitchen to get something and he's like it's not there. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1620.02s)]
*  I'm like yes it is. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1623.26s)]
*  I can see it but he can't see it. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1625.18s)]
*  But if that's the worst that's nothing. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1628.0600000000002s)]
*  He'll take it. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1631.38s)]
*  You feel hopeful about the future? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1632.38s)]
*  I do yes. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1636.2600000000002s)]
*  I learned that what I needed to do is accept that the old Dan is gone and then start working [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1637.94s)]
*  on the new me which has a future. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1647.5800000000002s)]
*  Dr. Rezai's team told us there's been no change in the ability of the three patients to do [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1651.7800000000002s)]
*  their daily activities since the ultrasound treatments ended in July. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1657.42s)]
*  Now that Dr. Rezai has shown FOGA's ultrasound can clear beta amyloid plaques faster, he [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1663.22s)]
*  has FDA approval to use ultrasound to try and restore brain cell function lost to Alzheimer's. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1667.74s)]
*  What's the result of breaking up all those plaques to the damage that's already been [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1675.1399999999999s)]
*  done to the brain? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1679.02s)]
*  We don't know if it's going to reverse the damage to the brain because Alzheimer's the [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1680.4199999999998s)]
*  underlying cause is still occurring. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1685.5s)]
*  We have another study that we're looking at with ultrasound. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1688.3s)]
*  First clear the plaques then deliver ultrasound in a different dose to see now if we can reverse [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1691.18s)]
*  it or boost the brain more for people with Alzheimer's. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1698.26s)]
*  When we come back we'll show you Dr. Rezai's new way to use ultrasound to reset the brain [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1703.48s)]
*  and help people suffering from drug addiction. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1709.04s)]
*  The human brain contains 100 billion neurons. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1717.8s)]
*  That's as many cells as there are stars across the Milky Way. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1727.08s)]
*  Dr. Ali Rezai has spent 25 years exploring this frontier of medicine. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1730.68s)]
*  The surgical techniques and therapies he pioneered are in use around the world. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1736.44s)]
*  Dr. Rezai allowed us to see his latest research over the last year at the Rockefeller Neuroscience [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1741.0s)]
*  Institute in Morgantown, West Virginia. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1747.56s)]
*  It includes revolutionary treatments for a brain disease suffered by 24 million Americans, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1750.84s)]
*  addiction. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1756.52s)]
*  The results so far have been life changing for the people we met once trapped by drugs. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1757.6s)]
*  Looking back I didn't have a chance. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1764.9199999999998s)]
*  What do you mean you didn't have a chance? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1765.9199999999998s)]
*  I couldn't do anything without having that drug in my system. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1768.44s)]
*  Jared Buchalter is the son of a coal miner. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1775.96s)]
*  At 6 foot 3 he was a high school football standout who dreamed of playing wide receiver [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1778.68s)]
*  at Penn State. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1784.1200000000001s)]
*  But after a shoulder injury he got hooked on painkillers. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1785.92s)]
*  The very first time that I took that first pill I knew that I wanted that feeling for [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1790.16s)]
*  the rest of my life. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1796.2s)]
*  What does it feel like? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1797.2s)]
*  It's just pure euphoria. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1798.92s)]
*  He took us to where he said he often went to buy drugs, including heroin. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1801.04s)]
*  Everybody in Morgantown knows to come here. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1805.88s)]
*  Probably 17, 18 years old, you know, just a kid. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1808.68s)]
*  Buchalter still looks like an athlete. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1813.1200000000001s)]
*  It's hard to imagine he was an addict for more than 15 years. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1815.5600000000002s)]
*  He told us he does not remember how many times he overdosed and that he couldn't stay clean [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1819.94s)]
*  for more than four days at a time. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1824.96s)]
*  I didn't know where I was going to sleep some nights. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1827.24s)]
*  My family didn't want me around anymore. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1829.88s)]
*  I did so many things to hurt them that it was just too much for them to deal with. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1833.28s)]
*  Four years ago a psychologist who'd worked with Buchalter introduced him to Dr. Olly [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1839.2s)]
*  Rezai who was gearing up to perform a new kind of brain surgery to treat severe addiction. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1844.08s)]
*  Our protocol was people that have failed everything. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1850.96s)]
*  Once you've tried everything? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1854.32s)]
*  Everything. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1855.32s)]
*  Residential programs, multiple failures, detox multiple times, outpatient, inpatient, multiple [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1856.52s)]
*  overdoses. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1862.72s)]
*  I think he classified it as end-stage drug user. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1864.08s)]
*  I mean end-stage makes you think that this is the end of your life. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1868.08s)]
*  Correct. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1871.84s)]
*  And hearing that at the age of 34, it was crazy. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1872.84s)]
*  Bring the EDS electrode in. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1877.52s)]
*  Dr. Rezai thought he might be able to adapt technology he helped develop years earlier [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1879.8s)]
*  to treat Parkinson's disease to treat people with severe addiction. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1885.16s)]
*  We've been able to map out with neuroscience imaging there's a specific part of the brain [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1890.3999999999999s)]
*  that is electrically and chemically malfunctioning that is associated with addiction. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1895.84s)]
*  So it's not just willpower, it's what's happening in the brain. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1901.0s)]
*  It's a brain disease. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1904.96s)]
*  It's an electrical and chemical abnormality in the brain that occurs over time with recurrent [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1906.08s)]
*  use of drugs. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1911.8s)]
*  And this can be any substance. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1913.6799999999998s)]
*  Alcohol, can be opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and they all are involving the same part of [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1915.52s)]
*  the brain. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1921.92s)]
*  And so your idea was what with the implant? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1922.92s)]
*  Parkinson's we implant that in the movement part of the brain that is electrically malfunctioning, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1925.8799999999999s)]
*  causing shaking. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1931.2s)]
*  In this case we're going into behavioral regulation, anxiety and craving parts of the brain. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1932.56s)]
*  Dr. Rezai has seen the impact of addiction in his community. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1938.8s)]
*  The problem is so severe in Morgantown, a vending machine dispenses the overdose antidote [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1943.52s)]
*  Narcan for free. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1948.84s)]
*  You got your baselines. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1950.4s)]
*  The National Institute on Drug Abuse agreed to support Dr. Rezai's attempt to fight addiction [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1951.96s)]
*  with a brain implant. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1957.28s)]
*  In 2019, the FDA gave him a green light to attempt the groundbreaking surgery. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1958.92s)]
*  That is Jared Buchhalter. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1966.68s)]
*  He agreed to be the first addiction patient in the U.S. to get the implant. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1968.44s)]
*  Dr. Rezai's team interviewed him the day before the surgery. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1973.08s)]
*  The best outcome possible would be just to cut the cravings out and make me feel a little [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1976.8799999999999s)]
*  bit better. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1984.56s)]
*  If those couple things happen, that's all I could possibly ask for. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1985.56s)]
*  At that time I was so desperate for a better life that I was willing to do just about anything [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=1994.48s)]
*  and I signed up to do it. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2001.0800000000002s)]
*  I think some people might look at this and think an electronic implant in the brain sounds [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2003.0800000000002s)]
*  a little creepy. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2008.44s)]
*  People maybe 50 years ago they say an implant in the heart sounds creepy. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2009.96s)]
*  Now it's like normal. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2014.0s)]
*  25 years ago people were saying what are you doing? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2015.72s)]
*  You're putting an implant in the brain for Parkinson's. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2018.8s)]
*  But now it is routine part of standard of care for advanced Parkinson's. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2021.42s)]
*  This is video from the seven hour procedure. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2027.28s)]
*  Surgery so new it didn't have a name yet. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2030.28s)]
*  Dr. Rezai opened a nickel sized hole in Buchhalter's skull. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2033.8s)]
*  Then he directed a thin wire with four electrodes deep inside. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2038.56s)]
*  Jared was awake during the surgery. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2046.04s)]
*  Why was that necessary? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2047.76s)]
*  To map the brain. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2049.56s)]
*  We have tiny microphones the size of a hair we put inside the brain and they're going [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2050.84s)]
*  slowly with micro robots. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2055.48s)]
*  They go at increments of a thousandth of a millimeter. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2057.44s)]
*  Very slow we drive them into the brain and we're listening to the neurons talking to [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2060.4s)]
*  each other. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2064.2400000000002s)]
*  In addiction we want to find the area in the reward center so that confirms where we are [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2065.2400000000002s)]
*  in the brain. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2070.6s)]
*  Once we listen and say okay that's the right sound then we put the final therapeutic pacemaker. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2071.6s)]
*  What does it sound like? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2077.56s)]
*  Static electricity which may be electricity to you but it's music to my ears. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2079.36s)]
*  Because Dr. Rezai says it's a signal that he found the right spot in the brain for the [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2084.4s)]
*  implant. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2090.0400000000004s)]
*  Once in place the wire was connected to a device placed below the collarbone. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2092.0400000000004s)]
*  The electrical pulses it sends to the brain are intended to suppress cravings. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2097.6400000000003s)]
*  Buchhalter said it was painless. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2102.96s)]
*  Post surgery the system is adjusted remotely with a tablet computer as needed. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2105.2400000000002s)]
*  When they turned the unit on it was an immediate change. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2110.72s)]
*  What was the change? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2114.52s)]
*  Just felt better. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2116.3199999999997s)]
*  You know just felt like I did prior to ever using drugs but a little bit better and it [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2117.52s)]
*  was at that point that I knew that I was going to have a legitimate shot at doing well. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2124.7599999999998s)]
*  In all four patients with severe drug addiction had the implant surgery. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2132.56s)]
*  One had a minor relapse. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2137.24s)]
*  Another dropped out of the trial completely. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2139.16s)]
*  But two have been drug free since their operations including Jared Buchhalter who's been clean [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2141.12s)]
*  for four years. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2147.72s)]
*  If you hadn't met Dr. Rezai if you hadn't gone through this implant do you think you'd [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2149.3399999999997s)]
*  be sitting here talking to me today? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2154.12s)]
*  You may be talking to my parents you know those that have lost their loved ones to a [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2156.7999999999997s)]
*  drug overdose but you wouldn't be talking to me. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2162.3999999999996s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2166.64s)]
*  Ah beautiful beautiful. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2168.24s)]
*  The surgery was a success but opening someone's skull is always risky. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2170.56s)]
*  Dr. Rezai thought he could reach more patients quickly if he used ultrasound. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2175.7999999999997s)]
*  He was already using it to treat other brain disorders and was convinced focused ultrasound [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2181.96s)]
*  could target the same area of the brain as the implant. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2187.44s)]
*  Is this brain surgery without a knife? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2191.48s)]
*  It is indeed. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2193.68s)]
*  So there's no skin cutting, there's no opening the skull so it is brain surgery without cutting [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2194.96s)]
*  the skin indeed. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2200.78s)]
*  Now this is just the measuring part right? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2201.78s)]
*  Dr. Rezai explained how his team would be the first to treat addicts by aiming hundreds [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2204.08s)]
*  of beams of ultrasound to a precise point deep inside the brain. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2209.16s)]
*  So the area that we're treating is the reward center in the brain which is the nucleus accumbens [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2214.3s)]
*  which is right down at the base of this dark area and then we deliver ultrasound waves [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2220.38s)]
*  to that specific part of the brain and we watch how acutely on the table your cravings [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2229.58s)]
*  and your anxiety changes in response to ultrasound. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2236.06s)]
*  How is the ultrasound making a change here? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2238.96s)]
*  Ultrasound energy is changing the electrical and chemical activity in this structure in [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2243.1s)]
*  the brain involving addiction and cravings. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2249.7s)]
*  Just resetting them and giving them kind of a fresh start? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2253.3399999999997s)]
*  At this point it seems like the brain is being reset or rebooting of the brain and the cravings [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2257.2999999999997s)]
*  are less, they're managed, anxiety is better so now that allows them to interact with the [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2262.22s)]
*  therapist. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2268.3799999999997s)]
*  It's very important to know that this is not a cure but an augmentation of the therapy [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2269.3799999999997s)]
*  by reducing the cravings and anxiety that's so overwhelming that the therapist has difficulty [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2274.42s)]
*  working with the patient. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2280.1s)]
*  Last February we watched Dr. Azai use focused ultrasound to treat Dave Martin who told us [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2281.86s)]
*  he's been surrounded by friends and family who use drugs his whole life. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2288.34s)]
*  When did you start using drugs? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2292.7400000000002s)]
*  When I was seven years old. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2295.02s)]
*  Seven? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2296.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2297.26s)]
*  I did drugs for 37 years. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2298.26s)]
*  What kind of drugs were you using? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2300.46s)]
*  Anything I can get my hands on. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2303.14s)]
*  Inside the MRI Martin was shown these images of drug use to stoke his cravings. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2306.42s)]
*  His legs were moving a lot and he was very agitated. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2311.7s)]
*  A simultaneous brain scan allowed Dr. Azai and his team to immediately spot the area [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2314.58s)]
*  in the nucleus accumbens that was most active. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2320.98s)]
*  I'd like to see the targets one more time. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2323.8199999999997s)]
*  90 watts of ultrasound energy were beamed at a target the size of a gumdrop. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2325.8199999999997s)]
*  Ready? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2331.3399999999997s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2332.34s)]
*  Within minutes we noticed Martin's foot that had been anxiously bouncing was still and [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2334.02s)]
*  he told Azai's team that those same images of drugs he was shown earlier were now not [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2339.1000000000004s)]
*  sparking the need for a fix. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2344.38s)]
*  Heroin is going down. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2346.58s)]
*  Meth is also going down. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2347.58s)]
*  Marijuana is down. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2350.58s)]
*  Marijuana is down? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2351.58s)]
*  A lot actually. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2352.58s)]
*  Good. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2353.58s)]
*  Keep on sonigating. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2354.58s)]
*  The day of the procedure it was the best day of my life. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2355.58s)]
*  I didn't experience the same effect as like the times before. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2359.98s)]
*  You didn't feel like I need that? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2366.22s)]
*  I want that? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2367.86s)]
*  No, I didn't feel like I needed that. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2368.86s)]
*  The urge or the desire to use wasn't there anymore. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2369.86s)]
*  So within 15 to 20 minutes of treatment the craving and anxiety melts away and we're seeing [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2374.06s)]
*  this pattern in multiple instances. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2380.38s)]
*  Then they can walk away after this? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2382.26s)]
*  They get off the table and go home. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2384.5s)]
*  And how long does this entire procedure? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2387.82s)]
*  One hour. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2389.9s)]
*  One hour? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2390.9s)]
*  One hour. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2391.9s)]
*  Have you been around people still using drugs? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2392.9s)]
*  Yes, yes unfortunately I have. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2395.14s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2396.98s)]
*  It didn't even trigger me. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2397.98s)]
*  I used to use endurinius with needles and it was a little while ago, not too far back, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2401.1800000000003s)]
*  but this one individual was trying to hit herself and they couldn't hit and they asked [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2407.46s)]
*  me can you hit me? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2413.78s)]
*  Do you actually put drugs in this person? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2416.34s)]
*  I actually stuck them, drew the blood back. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2418.5s)]
*  Now before when I drew the blood back it would make me sweat because I couldn't wait to hit [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2421.58s)]
*  myself but this time it was just like God I hope they don't OD and I kill them here. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2426.58s)]
*  But I didn't have any urge or desire or anything. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2432.1s)]
*  Dr. Rezai's team told us Dave Martin did admit to taking one pain killing pill at a party [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2436.78s)]
*  in December. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2443.54s)]
*  10 of the 15 patients in the ultrasound clinical trials have remained completely drug free. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2445.7s)]
*  Dr. Ali Rezai is trying the same ultrasound therapy on 45 more addiction patients and [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2452.74s)]
*  is already thinking about expanding the use of ultrasound to help people with other brain [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2459.94s)]
*  disorders including post traumatic stress disorder and obesity. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2465.02s)]
*  This is serious business. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2471.14s)]
*  Research never been done before. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2472.66s)]
*  We have to learn more. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2474.2599999999998s)]
*  We have to replicate our findings. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2475.62s)]
*  Is there any risk at running towards something quickly? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2477.7s)]
*  There's always risk but you cannot advance and make discoveries without risk. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2481.58s)]
*  But we need to push forward and take the risk because people with addiction and Alzheimer's [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2487.18s)]
*  is not going away. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2493.22s)]
*  It's here. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2494.7s)]
*  So why wait 10, 20 years? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2495.7s)]
*  Do it now. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2498.14s)]
*  Now an update of our story, Who is Ray Epps? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2504.22s)]
*  In April we spoke with the January 6th rioter and his wife in hiding and fearing for their [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2510.9399999999996s)]
*  lives. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2516.4199999999996s)]
*  Ray Epps had become the target of a conspiracy theory. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2517.74s)]
*  Offering no evidence, the conspiracist portrayed Epps as an FBI informant sent to incite the [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2521.06s)]
*  rioters. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2527.1s)]
*  Did anyone from the federal government direct you to be here at the peace circle at this [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2528.94s)]
*  time? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2537.3s)]
*  No. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2538.3s)]
*  No one from the FBI? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2539.3s)]
*  No. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2540.3s)]
*  Your old comrades with the oath keepers? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2541.82s)]
*  No. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2544.98s)]
*  Ray Epps pleaded guilty to entering a restricted area on the Capitol grounds. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2546.78s)]
*  This past Tuesday he was sentenced to a year's probation and community service for his role [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2551.82s)]
*  in the January 6th attack. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2557.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2559.74s)]
*  We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2560.74s)]
*  Join us for a special edition of the CBS Evening News from Iowa tomorrow. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1UW1Yjng5g&t=2569.74s)]
