# Stories About Wildfires | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M)
*  TICKING [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, Bill Whittaker is covering the historic L.A. wildfires from the air and from the ground, starting in Altadena, California. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=12.0s)]
*  The Eaton fire burst out of the San Gabriel Mountains above Altadena Tuesday night. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=23.0s)]
*  It has since devoured more than 7,000 homes and structures in this tight-knit, diverse community, making it one of the most savage firestorms in Los Angeles County's history. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=28.0s)]
*  The death toll is rising. Wildfires are a fact of life here, but nothing prepared people for destruction on this scale. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=41.0s)]
*  Rows of chimneys now stand like tombstones, towering palm trees like burned matchsticks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=50.0s)]
*  We found fire crews still working to contain the inferno, and a dazed Calvin family sifting through the ruins of their homes and their lives. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=58.0s)]
*  This is unreal. Oh my God. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=69.0s)]
*  My house is on fire. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=74.0s)]
*  Zaire Calvin and his family have called Altadena home for three generations. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=79.0s)]
*  I just wonder if anything is left. The rocking chair for the baby. I literally just built all of this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=85.0s)]
*  Calvin, a high school football coach, has lived on this block his whole life. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=94.0s)]
*  He has seen a number of wildfires flare up in the foothills, but never in his 47 years had he seen anything like the firestorm that swept off the mountain this past Tuesday. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=99.0s)]
*  And out of nowhere you see the fire appear across Lake Street, and you can see it going up the mountain on our side within an hour. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=112.0s)]
*  For it to move that quickly and that rapidly and for it to shift paths that fast was insane. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=122.0s)]
*  Altadena gone, bro, it's over. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=130.0s)]
*  His son Jamir told us the winds kicked up and power went down across the neighborhood. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=133.0s)]
*  It was like a hurricane, just fire, no water, but like 80 miles an hour plus, it felt surreal. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=139.0s)]
*  Was the fire like racing down the hill at that point? Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=146.0s)]
*  That's what's scary about this. It just was shooting like a blowtorch. Like a blowtorch. It was literally just shooting off of the mountain. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=148.0s)]
*  It felt like you were being attacked by a storm. Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=158.0s)]
*  As the fire bore down on them, Zaire put his wife, baby, and mother into the car. Jamir grabbed what he could. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=161.0s)]
*  I'm lucky to even have the little bag of clothes that I have left, but as far as trophies, memories, diplomas, everything else just went up in flames. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=169.0s)]
*  My mom just said it to me. She's like, everything's gone. You mean the books that we have? Like nothing? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=179.0s)]
*  I'm just like, mom, it's all gone. All of it. Every memory, all those things are gone. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=186.0s)]
*  We have whatever's left in our heads to rebuild with. All of it's gone. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=193.0s)]
*  This fire in Altadena was just one of eight destructive wildfires that lay siege to Los Angeles this past week. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=199.0s)]
*  With almost no rain for eight months, hillsides and backyards were bone dry, primed to burn. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=208.0s)]
*  Investigators are still trying to determine how the fire started. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=218.0s)]
*  But whipped by ferocious Santa Ana winds, those blazes roared down city streets and spread like a deadly virus. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=223.0s)]
*  No place seemed immune. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=232.0s)]
*  Neighborhoods not engulfed in flames were blanketed by smoke and ash. Wealth and status offered no protection. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=235.0s)]
*  Affluent Pacific Palisades was first to fall. Thousands of structures were destroyed. Thousands of people were forced to flee. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=242.0s)]
*  The conditions that night were unbearable. It was a devil wind that came out. You know, that extreme Santa Ana wind condition. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=251.0s)]
*  Anthony Moroney is chief of the LA County Fire Department, one of the officials overseeing the firefight. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=262.0s)]
*  He told us the devil winds hurled embers far ahead of the fire, like snowfall from hell. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=268.0s)]
*  Embers like this are transported in the smoke column and pushed downwind or bigger. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=277.0s)]
*  So this is being blown by the winds way beyond the... [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=284.0s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of burning embers, this size and bigger, being transported by that wind and that smoke column. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=287.0s)]
*  Chief Moroney says fires normally run uphill. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=296.0s)]
*  But with these winds, it was pushed downhill into these neighborhoods. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=300.0s)]
*  And sending these embers blocks, if not miles ahead. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=304.0s)]
*  And the embers were being generated not only by the brush on the hillsides, but by the homes that were being burned. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=308.0s)]
*  When the life-threatening winds started building, Moroney told us he called up extra crews and engines. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=314.0s)]
*  But the fires grew too big too fast. Demand for water overburdened the system. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=321.0s)]
*  Water pressure dropped and fire hoses ran dry, while the fires raged. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=327.0s)]
*  We hear that people were complaining that there wasn't enough water or wasn't enough water pressure. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=333.0s)]
*  Was that a factor? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=338.0s)]
*  So the water system was stretched. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=339.0s)]
*  Metropolitan water systems are not designed to sustain a firefight like this. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=342.0s)]
*  Your viewers can't expect a municipal water system to supply enough firefighting water to extinguish every one of these houses. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=348.0s)]
*  That's unrealistic. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=357.0s)]
*  Did you have enough resources? Did you have enough firefighters? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=359.0s)]
*  No. And there's not enough fire engines for this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=362.0s)]
*  Ordinarily, for one house like this, you might have three or four? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=366.0s)]
*  Three or four fire engines. We think we've lost 8,000 structures. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=371.0s)]
*  So times three fire engines each, that requires 26,000 fire engines. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=376.0s)]
*  I don't think the city is going to be able to do that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=382.0s)]
*  Mother Nature owned us. Owned us those two days. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=384.0s)]
*  Neighboring Orange County Fire Chief Brian Fenner, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=389.0s)]
*  was the first to say that there was no fire engines in the city. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=393.0s)]
*  He said, you know, we're going to have to get more fire engines. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=397.0s)]
*  We're going to have to get more fire engines. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=401.0s)]
*  We're going to have to get more fire engines. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=404.0s)]
*  We're going to have to get more fire engines. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=407.0s)]
*  And he owned us those two days. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=409.0s)]
*  Neighboring Orange County Fire Chief Brian Fenner has been fighting wildfires for almost five decades. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=412.0s)]
*  He dispatched hundreds of firefighters to help Chief Moroney and beleaguered crews across LA. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=419.0s)]
*  One of the most powerful tools in their arsenal? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=425.0s)]
*  This fleet of high-tech choppers that can fight fires 24-7, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=428.0s)]
*  dropping up to 3,000 gallons of water each pass. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=433.0s)]
*  But with Santa Ana winds gusting near 100 miles per hour, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=437.0s)]
*  the choppers were grounded during crucial early hours. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=442.0s)]
*  The fires that they experienced this week were unstoppable. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=448.0s)]
*  Unstoppable. Unstoppable. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=453.0s)]
*  What's it like for you, a firefighter, to have to say words like that? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=456.0s)]
*  It makes me feel bad, right? I mean, that's not in our nature. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=462.0s)]
*  I mean, we're fixers. That is the mindset. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=466.0s)]
*  We're going to put our lives on the line. We're going to give a lot to save a lot. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=470.0s)]
*  So when you have a fire, like you say, that's unstoppable, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=475.0s)]
*  man, that is, it's uncomfortable. It's very uncomfortable. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=478.0s)]
*  After an uncomfortable 27-hour delay, the choppers were able to get back into the fight when the winds died down. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=484.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=492.0s)]
*  On Thursday, Chief Fennessy let us join a reconnaissance flight so we could see the destruction from above. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=493.0s)]
*  Air attack, copter 7-6 on air tactics. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=499.0s)]
*  We flew over the fire zones. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=501.0s)]
*  We have active fire line all the way up towards the communication towers. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=503.0s)]
*  And saw an ashen checkerboard of devastation stretch below us for miles at Pacific Palisades. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=508.0s)]
*  When we flew over Altadena, where Chief Fennessy grew up, he found it hard to get his bearings. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=514.0s)]
*  Oh my goodness. It really wiped it out, man. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=520.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. Holy crud. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=523.0s)]
*  So the Rose Bowl's just down. Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=525.0s)]
*  Kind of orient you, kind of see the Rose Bowl from here. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=528.0s)]
*  I had no idea it extended this far. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=530.0s)]
*  You can see the charred buildings before your house is... [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=532.0s)]
*  Everything gone. Gone. Yeah. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=535.0s)]
*  In the early morning hours after the Altadena fire erupted, Chief Fennessy couldn't reach his brother. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=537.0s)]
*  Although it was out of his jurisdiction, he drove up from Orange County. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=543.0s)]
*  Here's Tony's house. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=548.0s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=550.0s)]
*  What a nightmare. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=554.0s)]
*  When he learned his brother was safe, he went to check on his longtime friend, Tony Goss. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=556.0s)]
*  And this is what he found. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=561.0s)]
*  I'm so sorry, Tony. Oh, my God, brother. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=563.0s)]
*  This place was glowing. It was completely hot. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=566.0s)]
*  There was a gas main over here that was venting. And so it was like a jet engine. It was pretty loud. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=569.0s)]
*  Tony's still in his pajamas. He looks like a firefighter. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=574.0s)]
*  His face is black from all the soot. And he's walking around. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=576.0s)]
*  I don't know if you remember this. You walk around kind of talking to yourself. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=582.0s)]
*  Goss had tried to save his home armed with just a garden hose. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=587.0s)]
*  But the fire was too fierce. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=592.0s)]
*  When we met him, he was still in disbelief that he'd been forced to walk away from his family home of more than 60 years. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=594.0s)]
*  But this was gone. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=603.0s)]
*  I knew it was time to leave. So I pulled out all my neighbors right there. I said, no, it's time. I said, I don't need to die today. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=604.0s)]
*  Chief Fennesey then went down the road to his brother's house. The block was in flames. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=614.0s)]
*  He discovered the gas meter at the house next door was surrounded by fire and about to ignite. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=620.0s)]
*  And he said there was no water. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=626.0s)]
*  So I needed to cool this down. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=629.0s)]
*  So Fennesey got creative. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=631.0s)]
*  I ended up forcing entry into through the front door and went through the house, you know, into the kitchen looking for bottled water, anything that I could use. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=632.0s)]
*  And so I ended up finding a carton of milk and I think there were a couple of beers or sodas, whatever the heck they were, and came out here and really literally had to kind of go in there under the heat, wet it and then get out because it was just this house was just burning. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=643.0s)]
*  And had to do that a few times till it was done. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=658.0s)]
*  Bet you've never saved a house with milk before. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=660.0s)]
*  No. To do nothing means the home is going to be lost. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=662.0s)]
*  And in this case, yeah, you know, a little bit of milk and a couple beers really saved the day. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=666.0s)]
*  The houses he fought to save are the only two left standing on the block. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=673.0s)]
*  The devil winds are forecast to intensify again tomorrow through Wednesday. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=680.0s)]
*  Evacuation orders have been expanded. The city remains on edge. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=684.0s)]
*  These fires are going to be an impact, you know, to the community, families, people for many, many years to come. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=690.0s)]
*  This is one of those fires, if not the fire, that they're going to be telling their grandchildren about. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=697.0s)]
*  This is just rubble. What is this? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=707.0s)]
*  In the chaos of evacuating his baby and elderly mother to safety, Zaire Calvin got separated from his sister Evelyn. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=709.0s)]
*  She lived next door. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=717.0s)]
*  Everybody's yelling, get out. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=719.0s)]
*  I'm thinking that she's getting out. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=721.0s)]
*  And the next day after the storm, I come back and her car is still there. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=724.0s)]
*  So at that point in my brain, my soul is shaking. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=732.0s)]
*  He and his cousin found Evelyn's remains in the rubble. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=738.0s)]
*  Evelyn, why did you leave? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=744.0s)]
*  Zaire's grief is shared. Five Calvin family members lived on this block. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=747.0s)]
*  Four lost their houses. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=753.0s)]
*  But they're trying to hold on to the hope that they can rebuild their beloved community. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=754.0s)]
*  Everyone's in the same boat. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=758.0s)]
*  Everybody you would depend on, everybody you will go to, they're all homeless also. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=760.0s)]
*  They just lost everything. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=766.0s)]
*  They've lost all the memories, all the joy, everything that we've built together. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=768.0s)]
*  And they're all homeless. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=773.0s)]
*  They're all homeless. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=775.0s)]
*  They're all homeless. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=777.0s)]
*  They're all homeless. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=779.0s)]
*  They've lost all the memories, all the joy, everything that we've built together. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=780.0s)]
*  In this neighborhood, we all lost together. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=785.0s)]
*  And I hate it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=788.0s)]
*  I hate it because I love Altavena. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=790.0s)]
*  The wildfire in August that ripped through the Hawaiian town of Lahaina was America's deadliest in 100 years. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=802.0s)]
*  And more than 99 people were killed. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=808.0s)]
*  You may recall the pictures of people jumping into the Pacific Ocean to escape as the fire burned most of the historic town in a matter of hours. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=811.0s)]
*  But there is an untold story about a group of firefighters who were also trapped while fighting fast-moving flames. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=820.0s)]
*  Tonight, you will hear from those Maui County firefighters about two of the worst hours of their lives. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=827.0s)]
*  They took a stand to save their hometown without the thing they depend on the most, water. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=833.0s)]
*  The morning began with blue skies and winds gusting nearly 60 miles an hour. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=839.0s)]
*  I was just watching the ocean and watching what was happening on the ocean and just never seen that before. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=845.0s)]
*  What was happening on the ocean? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=851.0s)]
*  It just was like froth. It was completely white. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=853.0s)]
*  And there was like whirlwind that was sat out there for over an hour. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=856.0s)]
*  Like they had been whipped out? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=860.0s)]
*  Yeah, the winds were just nuts. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=861.0s)]
*  Firefighter Ina Kohler drives engine three. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=863.0s)]
*  She grew up in Lahaina, the once postcard perfect town of 13,000, tucked between the West Maui Range and sparkling Pacific. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=866.0s)]
*  In Hawaiian, Lahaina means cruel sun. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=876.0s)]
*  But on August 8th, it was the wind, whipped up by a hurricane 500 miles offshore that showed no mercy. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=879.0s)]
*  We're used to wind, but we weren't used to that kind of wind. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=886.0s)]
*  I looked out my window and there was like a giant kiddie pool, like one of the bigger ones, flying through the air, like 100 feet up. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=889.0s)]
*  Frickin' power line just went down. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=896.0s)]
*  At 6.30 that morning, a resident recorded this video after a power line fell and ignited the dry grass that covers much of Lahaina's hillside. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=898.0s)]
*  At most, there are 17 firefighters on duty in West Maui. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=907.0s)]
*  Kohler's crew of four relieved the firefighters that first responded. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=912.0s)]
*  We had contained it, meaning it wasn't getting any bigger. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=916.0s)]
*  So now we were just putting water on all the hot spots to make sure that everything was fully out, just dousing everything in water. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=920.0s)]
*  How long were you out there? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=927.0s)]
*  We were probably until like two, and then we went on some calls in the neighborhood right next door of downed poles that were leaning on houses and downed lines. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=929.0s)]
*  Around 3 o'clock, Ina Kohler's crew was called back to the area of the morning brush fire. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=938.0s)]
*  This is police video. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=944.0s)]
*  Hey, there's a full paint tank! [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=946.0s)]
*  The hillside was on fire again. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=948.0s)]
*  How fast was the fire moving at that point? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=950.0s)]
*  I couldn't tell. I could tell how fast the smoke was moving and it was kind of like not even going up. It was just going sideways. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=952.0s)]
*  There's a big flame in here. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=958.0s)]
*  The cause of the afternoon fire is still unknown. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=960.0s)]
*  But Mike Walker had warned Hawaiian lawmakers about the danger of overgrown grass here for five years. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=962.0s)]
*  So how much of this is native to Hawaii? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=969.0s)]
*  None of it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=973.0s)]
*  Walker is in charge of fire protection for Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=975.0s)]
*  The type of grass he showed us is from Africa. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=980.0s)]
*  It was brought here a century ago for cattle grazing because it grows fast even when it's not in the wild. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=983.0s)]
*  What can you do to make sure that this isn't a tinderbox? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=989.0s)]
*  Well, a lot of the land right now is just unmanaged. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=994.0s)]
*  It's either folks don't have the finances or it's not economically worth it to work the land or they're just banking the land for future development. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=997.0s)]
*  I think you can see what happens when we do nothing. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1008.0s)]
*  On August 8th, a few minutes after three o'clock, the fire was still burning. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1011.0s)]
*  On August 8th, a few minutes after three o'clock, wind carried burning grass toward homes half a mile away. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1016.0s)]
*  And by the time I reported that over the radio, every structure I could see was on fire. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1024.0s)]
*  Six-foot-four Kiahi Ho is based in Lahaina on Ladder 3. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1031.0s)]
*  He mans its biggest weapon, a cannon that shoots 2,000 gallons of water a minute. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1035.0s)]
*  It would just blow away, you know. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1041.0s)]
*  I could stick it right in a window and put out that room, but the whole rest of the house is on fire and then every other house is on fire. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1043.0s)]
*  Then something he'd never experienced left him stunned. The hydrants started to run dry. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1053.0s)]
*  It was a real low point for me because we just, I knew that we had lost, you know, that we were going to really, this was going to be worse than we could imagine. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1060.0s)]
*  The county's Department of Water Supply told us the fire caused more than 2,000 pipe breaks, bleeding water out of the system. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1075.0s)]
*  It was somewhere around there that I heard that, for my mom's offices, which is a long ways away from where I was, it was on fire. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1083.0s)]
*  And then to know that it was there and to know that I was running out of water, I was like, man, it's over. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1094.0s)]
*  Like, we're going to keep trying, but it's over. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1101.0s)]
*  It's over. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1104.0s)]
*  This was the view from inside a fire truck. Black skies lit by an inferno that stretched for blocks. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1107.0s)]
*  Firefighters didn't have the water or the crews to stop it. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1114.0s)]
*  Residents say they never received an evacuation order, so by 4 p.m., police were racing around town to get people out. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1119.0s)]
*  Let's go! Hurry up! [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1129.0s)]
*  Let's go! [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1134.0s)]
*  At the same time, reinforcements started to arrive from other fire stations across Maui, including 26-year-old Tanner Mosier. He was with Engine 6. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1139.0s)]
*  Once you got into the smoke, it was like 5 feet of visibility, maybe 10 if you're lucky. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1150.0s)]
*  It's like a blowtorch being blown at you. The heat was just so intense. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1155.0s)]
*  Captain J. Fujita has been a firefighter almost as long as Tanner Mosier has been alive. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1159.0s)]
*  He commanded Engine 1 to take a position a few blocks beyond that wall of fire next to Mosier's crew. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1165.0s)]
*  At 430, streets were clogged with the cars of residents and tourists. This was a 911 operator. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1171.0s)]
*  You guys need to leave. If you can't drive away, get out of the car and run. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1178.0s)]
*  The abandoned cars and a web of downed power lines trapped the eight firefighters and their two engines. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1186.0s)]
*  Once we determined we wouldn't be able to escape the street that we were on, we pulled a line to kind of protect ourselves from the fire. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1193.0s)]
*  Just to keep the fire away from you? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1203.0s)]
*  Yeah, but the hose burned. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1205.0s)]
*  So you don't have a hose and you can't get out? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1207.0s)]
*  Yeah. Our only course of action was to shelter in place. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1210.0s)]
*  Inside the engines, they relied on air tanks to breathe. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1214.0s)]
*  We were just conserving our air as much as possible and just sitting in our seats. We were just fixating on making it out lasting. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1218.0s)]
*  So at that point it's surviving. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1229.0s)]
*  It's surviving for sure. I mean we could see metal melting in front of our eyes. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1231.0s)]
*  I had texted my wife. I told her I love her and to pass the message on to the rest of my family that I love them, that we're stuck and we might not be able to make it out. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1235.0s)]
*  But it was too hot in the truck so my phone wasn't working so the message didn't go through. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1246.0s)]
*  I just remember being like, I can't give up yet. I gotta do something. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1252.0s)]
*  And so I remember looking out the window and all of a sudden I could see engine one's skater, mini one. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1257.0s)]
*  The skater is a small fire truck like this one. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1268.0s)]
*  Mosier jumped into it alone to see if he could clear a path for the engines to get out. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1271.0s)]
*  Mosier says when he realized the skater couldn't drive through the barricade of cars, he made the snap decision to drive over them to find help. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1276.0s)]
*  And so I just remember putting in a four wheel drive and I launched the barricade and I kind of planed for a second and I was like, oh, okay, I made it over. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1284.0s)]
*  And at the end of the lot was a rock wall. So I launched over the rock wall and definitely caught some power lines. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1293.0s)]
*  So I'll just be driving through the smoke, not seeing anything, so I'm just like driving through, dodging stuff. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1300.0s)]
*  His truck was damaged, but down the road he saw the lights of a police car. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1306.0s)]
*  I just remember leaving most of my stuff in that truck and getting out, running to the cop and just telling him, hey, I got guys in there. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1310.0s)]
*  They need help, they're dying. And so he's like, hey, you can take my squad vehicle, just come back. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1318.0s)]
*  And so I hopped in there and just started driving back into the smoke where I knew I came from or where I remembered coming from. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1325.0s)]
*  As Mosier made his way back, Captain Fujita realized the fire truck was no longer offering protection. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1333.0s)]
*  And then I noticed our windshield failing. It started to fail. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1340.0s)]
*  Your windshield failing, what do you mean? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1345.0s)]
*  So the windshield is made up of two pieces of glass with a film in the middle and that film was delaminating and bubbling in the windshield. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1347.0s)]
*  So it's melting around you? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1358.0s)]
*  Yeah. So we got out of the truck and we all sheltered behind the engine. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1360.0s)]
*  We heard like a chirping of a siren, but because of the smoke we really couldn't see where it was coming from. But finally we seen a police SUV show up. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1365.0s)]
*  It was Tanner Mosier. Seven firefighters in gear crammed inside the SUV Mosier was driving, including his captain, Mike Mulally, who was unconscious from smoke inhalation. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1376.0s)]
*  He's on the far left in this picture taken before the fire. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1388.0s)]
*  He was in the car, the SUV with the door open and his boots were hanging, but they weren't touching the ground. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1390.0s)]
*  So they're just holding on to Captain? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1398.0s)]
*  Yeah. So all the guys that were able to reach him, they're just locked on. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1400.0s)]
*  With his captain's legs dangling out, Mosier says he jumped the loaded police SUV to safety. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1404.0s)]
*  Did Tanner Mosier save your life that day? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1410.0s)]
*  Yes, he saved all of our lives. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1413.0s)]
*  He's a young guy. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1415.0s)]
*  You can't teach that kind of heroism. You just had it in you. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1416.0s)]
*  Once clear, the firefighters performed CPR and stabilized Captain Mulally. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1423.0s)]
*  And then all seven of us ran back to work. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1429.0s)]
*  You kept fighting fires? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1433.0s)]
*  Yep. All the way until the next morning. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1435.0s)]
*  With little water, there was little they could do to save homes. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1437.0s)]
*  So as the sun set, the firefighters' mission shifted to saving anyone they could, any way they could. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1442.0s)]
*  Ina Kohler dished her fire engine and used a pickup to snake through the burning debris downtown. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1449.0s)]
*  A local she knew every way in and out. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1455.0s)]
*  There were some people in their cars stuck down there not knowing which way to get out. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1458.0s)]
*  And so I would jump in their car and I would drive their car out for them. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1463.0s)]
*  So everybody's trying to get out and you're going in? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1467.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1470.0s)]
*  Kohler, a mother of two, said her family was able to escape. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1472.0s)]
*  But like 16 other firefighters in Lahaina, she lost her home. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1474.0s)]
*  Did you ever think, like, why me? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1478.0s)]
*  No, I was like, everything else is burned down, why not my house? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1482.0s)]
*  You know, I didn't want to be feeling like I couldn't defend, you know, the entire town. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1487.0s)]
*  And if my house was still standing, I'd probably have even more guilt. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1494.0s)]
*  Once the sparkling jewel of Maui, this is Lahaina today. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1499.0s)]
*  Its treasures, now a sea of ash and charred metal. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1504.0s)]
*  More than 2,000 homes and businesses were destroyed. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1508.0s)]
*  Hawaii's attorney general is investigating the cause of the afternoon fire and how the water system failed. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1511.0s)]
*  Already in the hills above Lahaina, the flammable grass that set the stage for this disaster is growing back. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1518.0s)]
*  Captain J. Fujita took us to the street where his crew made it stand. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1526.0s)]
*  Your engine was right there? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1531.0s)]
*  Yeah, right there. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1533.0s)]
*  Those ashes in front of us are the outline of where fire consumed what was once Engine 1. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1535.0s)]
*  It's kind of like a grave, you know, coming back to see this. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1539.0s)]
*  After we left, it still was hot enough and bad enough to burn the engine. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1543.0s)]
*  To nothing? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1549.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1551.0s)]
*  What do you think about the fight now when you look back on it? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1553.0s)]
*  I think we all wish we could have done more. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1557.0s)]
*  We made it out and we're grateful, but at the same time, there's still people that didn't make it out. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1560.0s)]
*  Not far from where the Lahaina fire began is a line of crosses, one for each person who died. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1565.0s)]
*  The 100th victim was identified last week. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1572.0s)]
*  But by our count, Maui firefighters rescued at least 200 people from the flames. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1576.0s)]
*  Last summer, California suffered one of the most savage fire years in its history. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1581.0s)]
*  Drought and scorching temperatures turbocharged fires that were more extreme than ever. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1587.0s)]
*  Two of the biggest fires in state history laid siege to more than a million acres in northern California, burning down the entire state. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1593.0s)]
*  The fire was so intense that it was hard to even breathe. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1602.0s)]
*  One of the biggest fires in state history laid siege to more than a million acres in northern California, burning dangerously close to Lake Tahoe. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1605.0s)]
*  Firefighters didn't have a day off for months. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1614.0s)]
*  Fire chiefs warned there weren't enough aircraft to go around. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1617.0s)]
*  It's a war, one told us. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1621.0s)]
*  So fire chiefs from Southern California stole a page from the military, taking the fight to the night. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1623.0s)]
*  As we first reported last fall, a fleet of high-tech helicopters fought wildfires 24-7. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1629.0s)]
*  And for the first time, the giant Chinook, you've seen them in other war zones, led the night assault. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1636.0s)]
*  It was an $18 million pilot program that the fire chiefs hope will be a game changer. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1643.0s)]
*  The U.S. Forest Service was already short-staffed when the Caldor Fire exploded last August, turning towards South Lake Tahoe. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1649.0s)]
*  Thousands of residents were forced to flee. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1660.0s)]
*  To the north, the Dixie Fire rampaged for months, demolishing historic gold rush towns. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1663.0s)]
*  The drought-parched forest burned so hot, they generated their own fire. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1670.0s)]
*  Between the two infernos, more than 8,000 bone-weary firefighters fought a relentless battle. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1674.0s)]
*  Orange County Fire Chief Brian Fennessy, a former hotshot who has been fighting fires in Southern California for 44 years, told us there was no more give in the system. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1682.0s)]
*  These fires get so hot, they're so dangerous. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1694.0s)]
*  The Dixie Fire, who has been fighting fires in Southern California for 44 years, told us there was no more give in the system. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1696.0s)]
*  These fires get so large that there aren't enough firefighters, there aren't enough airplanes, helicopters, bulldozers. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1704.0s)]
*  I would think that would be worrisome. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1710.0s)]
*  We're to the point where if we were to send much more, we're going to have firehouses that are empty. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1712.0s)]
*  And for the people that we've sworn to serve, our taxpayers, it's not acceptable to have firehouses empty for any length of time. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1717.0s)]
*  Everything is stretched. Your suppression power is... [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1726.0s)]
*  We met Brian Fennessy at the Truckee Airfield, about 45 miles from the fires. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1729.0s)]
*  After Caldor destroyed the town of Grizzly Flats, Fennessy volunteered to send his new firefighting choppers north. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1734.0s)]
*  More like flying computers with rotors on top, they're called the Quick Reaction Force. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1742.0s)]
*  Fennessy calls the fleet the Hammer. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1748.0s)]
*  This is the Hammer. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1751.0s)]
*  9-1-1, you hit it with everything you've got, these big guys, and knock it out. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1752.0s)]
*  In case a fire break glass. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1757.0s)]
*  The star of the show is the massive Chinook. This one used to fly in Afghanistan for the U.S. Army. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1759.0s)]
*  It's been retrofitted to fight a different war, dropping water or retardant. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1765.0s)]
*  Now Fennessy told us they have this powerful new tool to take that fight to the night. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1771.0s)]
*  The ability to lay retardant line, to continue to drop fire retardant after sundown, that's a first. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1777.0s)]
*  That's going to change the way you fight fires. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1785.0s)]
*  We hope so. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1787.0s)]
*  The Chinook can drop 3,000 gallons. That's about 10 times what most firefighting choppers drop. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1789.0s)]
*  No bigger helicopter has ever fought fires at night. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1796.0s)]
*  They work hard. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1800.0s)]
*  Wayne Colson, the CEO of Colson Aviation, which built the fleet, is a pioneer in night firefighting. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1802.0s)]
*  He showed us the specially designed tank. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1809.0s)]
*  Computers control the tank's doors, opening at precise GPS points. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1812.0s)]
*  You can zero in exactly on the spot you want to drop. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1818.0s)]
*  We can fly the aircraft to those GPS points and the doors will automatically open and close between those two points. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1822.0s)]
*  Colson told us it's a more surgical strike. Flame retardant can be dropped in almost straight lines. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1827.0s)]
*  At night, there's an added advantage. The fire usually dies down. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1835.0s)]
*  Is that a better time to hit the fire? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1840.0s)]
*  It absolutely is. That's when it's its weakest. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1843.0s)]
*  Usually its weakest. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1845.0s)]
*  That's the time to attack an enemy at its weakest point in time. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1847.0s)]
*  The quick reaction force works in pairs. The Chinook gets its orders from this aircraft. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1849.0s)]
*  Think of it as a traffic control tower, but in the air. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1854.0s)]
*  Wearing night vision goggles, Orange County Air Attack Officer Joel Lane uses infrared cameras to see through the smoke to map the best targets for the Chinook. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1859.0s)]
*  It's a no go for anything on the east side. We're turning around now. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1871.0s)]
*  OK, copy that. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1874.0s)]
*  Lane has spent the last 23 years in the air. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1876.0s)]
*  Improved night vision technology has revived night firefighting. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1879.0s)]
*  Most agencies halted night flying after a mid-air collision in the 1970s. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1884.0s)]
*  Lane told us the technology means they can attack fires at any hour. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1889.0s)]
*  If you time a fire, let's say for one minute and it's two acres, in two minutes it's not going to be four, it's going to be nine, and in three minutes it's going to be 27. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1894.0s)]
*  And the fire is going faster. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1905.0s)]
*  The only thing that stops that is speed and force. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1906.0s)]
*  And that's what you get with the aircraft. That is exactly what you get with the aircraft. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1909.0s)]
*  In early September, we flew with Britt Colson, Wayne's son and tech wizard at Colson Aviation. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1912.0s)]
*  He turned on the powerful thermal imaging camera and the Caldor fire burst into view. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1919.0s)]
*  Those flames are higher than the trees. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1926.0s)]
*  As we flew closer, we watched a fountain of flames exploding over the treetops. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1928.0s)]
*  There was fire everywhere, every point of light a potentially hellish new blaze. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1934.0s)]
*  Embers that come up when it's really intense, they're going to spot out far ahead. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1941.0s)]
*  Zooming in, Britt Colson showed us a spot fire that had leapt over a containment line dug by firefighters. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1945.0s)]
*  So let's say if they were trying to catch it along that ridge line there. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1953.0s)]
*  It's already jumped over. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1957.0s)]
*  It's jumped over. Without this type of technology, they're never going to see that. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1959.0s)]
*  We circled the fires at 13,000 feet. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1963.0s)]
*  Below us, we spotted the command helicopter with Joel Lane. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1967.0s)]
*  A thousand feet below that is where the Chinook flies. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1971.0s)]
*  Lane directs the big chopper to the drop zone. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1975.0s)]
*  From our perch, we could almost count the trees as we flew over a blackened landscape. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1978.0s)]
*  Then we saw boats, docks and houses. South Lake Tahoe. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1983.0s)]
*  That's South Lake Tahoe Airport right there. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1989.0s)]
*  And then you got the fire right there. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1992.0s)]
*  Right behind you. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1994.0s)]
*  So there you've got all the individual embers coming up. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1996.0s)]
*  That's burning heavily. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=1998.0s)]
*  The Chinook sweeps across the flames. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2000.0s)]
*  Start drop, I can see the wet rock down here. I mean we're getting water down on it. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2003.0s)]
*  Drops its water, then heads to the nearest lake to refill. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2007.0s)]
*  Unlike fixed wing craft that have to return to base, the Chinook can refill anywhere. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2010.0s)]
*  Hovering like some prehistoric bird, it sucks up 3,000 gallons in 90 seconds. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2017.0s)]
*  Start pull, start pulling. Start pulling the toy. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2023.0s)]
*  This doesn't come cheap. A heli-tanker can cost up to 15 million dollars and 8,000 dollars an hour to operate. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2026.0s)]
*  But Joel Lane told us it's money well spent. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2035.0s)]
*  I got you. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2038.0s)]
*  He told us about the tuna fire which ignited in dry brush near Malibu last July. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2040.0s)]
*  It was promptly doused by a quick reaction Chinook at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2045.0s)]
*  A fraction of what it would have cost if the fire had gotten out of control. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2051.0s)]
*  If you never heard of the tuna fire, says Lane, that's a win. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2056.0s)]
*  So the 10 acre fire that we catch 98 percent of the time, it's never going to make the paper. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2061.0s)]
*  You're never going to hear about it. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2065.0s)]
*  The public wakes up the next day and unless they drive by it, they never know what happened. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2067.0s)]
*  And we do that very successfully, especially in Southern California. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2071.0s)]
*  The finances that you're laying out, that yes, it's expensive to have these aircraft, but it's more expensive if you don't catch the fire. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2075.0s)]
*  Exponentially. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2083.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2085.0s)]
*  In Northern California, the Dixie Fire became the largest single fire in state history. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2087.0s)]
*  Firefighters fought the Caldor Fire for months, the cost more than a half billion dollars and climbing. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2091.0s)]
*  Yet during our trip last August, the heli-tankers flew only one out of four nights. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2099.0s)]
*  We wondered why. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2105.0s)]
*  So did Orange County Fire Chief Brian Fennessy, who had sent his best equipment to fight the state's worst fires. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2107.0s)]
*  Did they not put it to work as soon as you brought it up here? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2115.0s)]
*  Not initially, no. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2118.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2119.0s)]
*  Because they didn't have any familiarization with flying at night. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2120.0s)]
*  But it's proven. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2125.0s)]
*  And we're in the middle of chaos and uncertainty and homes are burning. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2126.0s)]
*  That doesn't work. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2131.0s)]
*  In the week we were there, the Caldor Fire grew by 40,000 acres. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2133.0s)]
*  Perhaps as alarming, we discovered the slowdown was fueled in part by infighting between the U.S. Forest Service, which oversees federal lands, and Cal Fire, responsible for state forests. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2138.0s)]
*  Chief Fennessy told us he twice offered up his new fleet and twice met with discord and confusion. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2150.0s)]
*  Again, onto our GoNoGo checklist. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2159.0s)]
*  We saw the Forest Service sign off on decisions only to have them changed by Cal Fire. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2161.0s)]
*  Firefighters told us the agencies disagreed about night missions, radio frequencies, how to feed firefighters. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2167.0s)]
*  They both challenged the credentials of the Orange County flight crews. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2175.0s)]
*  That doesn't seem like the most efficient way to handle the resources, especially in the face of a huge fire. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2178.0s)]
*  Extremely frustrating. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2186.0s)]
*  We have a system, the fire service, where we honor each other's qualifications. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2188.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is frustrating because, you know, when there's a delay in accepting these qualifications to the detriment of the public, yeah, that's a concern. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2193.0s)]
*  When Chief Fennessy first sent his choppers, two crews sat on the tarmac for 48 hours. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2201.0s)]
*  Fed up, he protested in an email, which we obtained through a Freedom of Information request. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2208.0s)]
*  I don't think the public will understand this nonsense, he wrote, especially if our crews are grounded and there are no aviation safety issues to address. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2214.0s)]
*  Cal Fire told us the crew check was a standard safety procedure and that smoke and wind prevented flying some nights. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2223.0s)]
*  Chief Fennessy told us only when he threatened to take his choppers back south did the agencies give the green light to fly. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2231.0s)]
*  Still, Brian Fennessy and two other Southern California Fire Chiefs were so dismayed the fleet was being used so little, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2239.0s)]
*  they complained in an email to the Forest Service, quote, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2246.0s)]
*  There was ample opportunity for the safe, consistent operation of the Quick Reaction Force both during the day and at night, but this did not occur. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2250.0s)]
*  Well, I have an expectation that if I'm going to loan you, you know, my stuff because you're having an emergency, you're going to put it to work. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2261.0s)]
*  If you're not going to put it to work, send it home because I've got work and I've got citizens here to protect. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2267.0s)]
*  We're going to go to work. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2272.0s)]
*  Fennessy told us the intensity of these fires demands a new approach to fighting them. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2273.0s)]
*  I'd heard from agencies at the highest level that there was not a concern for aviation safety. It was more of a concern for bureaucracy. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2279.0s)]
*  You said it. The fires are changing. Fires are changing. Climate is changing. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2289.0s)]
*  We've got to be more nimble. We've got to be able to pivot very quickly. Fires aren't going to wait for you to get your act together. No, they're not. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2293.0s)]
*  We repeatedly asked CAL FIRE and the Forest Service why the night flying choppers weren't used more. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2301.0s)]
*  Weeks later, they did get together to issue a joint statement about their, quote, shared mission. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2307.0s)]
*  They wrote, each fire presents its own unique challenges and fire managers stand shoulder to shoulder every day to overcome these hurdles. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2314.0s)]
*  The day after we left, Chief Fennessy took his quick reaction force back south where the Santa Ana winds and the number of fires were picking up. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2323.0s)]
*  Fennessy told us with fires getting more extreme, CAL FIRE and the Forest Service can't afford to sideline the big hammer. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2332.0s)]
*  These aircraft are being credited with saving countless property because they're available at night to do that. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2342.0s)]
*  And you've proven it. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2348.0s)]
*  Proven it. It's a program that I believe needs to expand not just to Northern California, but throughout the West. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2349.0s)]
*  What's the resistance? Why the resistance? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2355.0s)]
*  You know, my gut tells me, based on decades of experience in the fire service, that there's just an inherent resistance to change. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2357.0s)]
*  But we've got to evolve. We've got to pivot. We are standing in a new world. It's not a new norm. It's the norm. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2367.0s)]
*  The Quick Reaction Force has been funded for a second fire season, July through December. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2377.0s)]
*  The morning of November 8, a massive wildfire tore through California mountain communities north of Sacramento. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2393.0s)]
*  Because it started near Camp Creek Road, it was called the Camp Fire. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2400.0s)]
*  The cause is still under investigation. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2405.0s)]
*  But within a couple of hours, it devoured the town of Paradise, population 27,000. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2408.0s)]
*  About 95% of Paradise was lost. Its smaller neighbors, Con Cal and Megalia, were all but destroyed. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2415.0s)]
*  Until now, last year's wildfire in California's wine country was the worst on record in the state. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2424.0s)]
*  The Federal Climate Report released last month warns increasing extreme heat and drought conditions could make future wildfires even worse. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2431.0s)]
*  Tonight, we'll take you into the Camp Fire and show you what the firefighters saw. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2441.0s)]
*  That video and the destruction had us wondering how anything could be worse. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2448.0s)]
*  This is Paradise, or what remains of it, block after ashen block of burned houses and ruined lives. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2457.0s)]
*  Three weeks ago, children played here, people shopped here, and families prayed here. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2467.0s)]
*  The wildfire that roared through Paradise was as random as it was merciless. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2474.0s)]
*  In just a few terrifying hours, it killed about 90 people and destroyed almost 19,000 buildings, businesses and homes. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2479.0s)]
*  Paradise sits in the heart of Butte County. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2489.0s)]
*  On the morning of November 8, County Sheriff and Coroner Cory Honey woke up and saw an ominous glow. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2493.0s)]
*  He knew it was a fire and it was heading his way. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2501.0s)]
*  So at what point in the morning did you realize that you had to evacuate this whole town? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2505.0s)]
*  I think the best way that I can characterize it is it was outrunning us before we even knew we were in a race or what direction the race was going to take us. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2509.0s)]
*  It was dark. It seemed like it was nighttime because the smoke had blocked out the sun. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2518.0s)]
*  Ash and embers were raining down. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2525.0s)]
*  And as the fire grew closer, there was this real sense of it being hell on Earth. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2528.0s)]
*  The sheriff quickly mobilized his deputies. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2539.0s)]
*  Firefighters raced to defend the town, but they were overwhelmed. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2542.0s)]
*  The fire was too fast and too big. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2547.0s)]
*  Strike Team 9231C found themselves driving straight into the inferno. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2551.0s)]
*  The crew shot this video from the truck. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2557.0s)]
*  Captain John Jessen was behind the wheel. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2562.0s)]
*  He told us he's seen many wildfires in his 24 years as a California state firefighter, but all paled compared to this. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2565.0s)]
*  What made this one so different? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2574.0s)]
*  The fire front that was coming up the canyon was literally miles long and 200 foot flame lengths. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2576.0s)]
*  It's hard to describe how fast this fire was moving. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2582.0s)]
*  Residents fleeing the maelstrom had turned all routes out of paradise into gridlocked death traps. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2586.0s)]
*  The strike team got caught in the traffic jam. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2593.0s)]
*  Why are these people here? They need to get the f*** out of here. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2596.0s)]
*  Panicked people abandoned their cars. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2602.0s)]
*  A sheriff's deputy captured the chaos on his body cam. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2605.0s)]
*  Four people made their way to the strike team truck, including Eva Walker. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2609.0s)]
*  What was the fire doing at this point? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2615.0s)]
*  The bushes were catching on fire, the trees were on fire, so you're moving to get away from the flames, but there's nowhere to move to. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2617.0s)]
*  She thought she'd been saved when the strike team pulled her into the truck. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2625.0s)]
*  Captain Jessen made a desperate radio call for air support, but the smoke was too thick, the winds too strong for help from above. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2630.0s)]
*  Firefighter Casey Peck quietly started to pray. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2639.0s)]
*  I was just thinking to myself, just praying, like, please Lord be merciful and watch over us, watch over our families. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2644.0s)]
*  You were praying for your life? Yeah. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2651.0s)]
*  Just then, through the darkness, two lights appeared. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2655.0s)]
*  A firefighter driving a bulldozer responded to Jessen's call for help and started clearing an escape route. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2659.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, the bulldozer, who I swear to God is an angel, was the one who came through. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2666.0s)]
*  I don't know where that man came from. I mean, who does that? Who drives into the flames? He did. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2675.0s)]
*  You called him an angel? Called him an angel. He saved all of us. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2682.0s)]
*  Her angel was bulldozer driver Joe Kennedy. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2686.0s)]
*  So I was taking the burning cars and pushing them off the road away from the people in the cars that weren't on fire. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2691.0s)]
*  Sam Leighton was behind Kennedy in another fire truck. Both opened their doors to let people in. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2696.0s)]
*  It was a blessing and a curse to go to that fire, but I'm happy that I was there to help people. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2704.0s)]
*  Leighton, Kennedy and the strike team took nine civilians to safety, then turned around, went back in and saved more. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2709.0s)]
*  There's points where you're scared or where you think, I shouldn't have come this far into the fire. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2719.0s)]
*  But at the same time, you have to keep going because the lives and property are at stake. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2724.0s)]
*  We were in a situation where there weren't enough fire engines and there weren't enough law enforcement officers. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2729.0s)]
*  The resources all overwhelmed by this fire? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2734.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2738.0s)]
*  How would you describe this fire? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2739.0s)]
*  Apocalyptic. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2741.0s)]
*  Using this new tool, Ken Pimlott, chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, showed us how fast the campfire spread. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2742.0s)]
*  Computerized projections on this 3D map chart the course of the fire. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2752.0s)]
*  Where did the fire start? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2757.0s)]
*  The fire started in the community of Polga at about 630 in the morning on November 8th, and it was quickly accelerated by 40 mile an hour winds coming from the north. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2760.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2768.0s)]
*  The fire was growing at this time at a rate of one football field a second, so an acre a second. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2769.0s)]
*  A football field a second. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2774.0s)]
*  Yes. Within two hours, the fire is impacting the community of Paradise. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2775.0s)]
*  It took 12 hours to essentially consume all of that as a record pays. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2780.0s)]
*  How many acres in total? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2784.0s)]
*  153,300 acres. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2786.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2788.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2789.0s)]
*  Everyone says that this is the new normal. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2791.0s)]
*  We're now every year seeing fires like this that are becoming more and more extreme. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2794.0s)]
*  We had five years of drought. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2799.0s)]
*  The vegetation is just critically parched. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2801.0s)]
*  Our temperatures, the mean temperature in the state is going up. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2803.0s)]
*  And so these are all factors that are just really a combination of things that are driving very extreme events. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2806.0s)]
*  The same day, wildfire razed Paradise. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2814.0s)]
*  The Woolsey fire erupted in Southern California. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2818.0s)]
*  The wind whipped flames killed three people, destroyed 1500 structures and burned more than 90,000 acres in and around Malibu. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2821.0s)]
*  The brown fire scarred terrain can be seen from space. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2832.0s)]
*  Californians have to learn to live with fires like this. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2837.0s)]
*  These fires are showing no sign of letting up. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2840.0s)]
*  There's no reason for them to stop based on the conditions that we're seeing. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2842.0s)]
*  Hey, any luck on tracking that fellow down? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2846.0s)]
*  As sheriff, Corey Honey is coordinating law enforcement's response in Paradise. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2848.0s)]
*  This is horrible work and I'm sorry that you have to do it. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2854.0s)]
*  As coroner, he's overseen the search of every structure burned in the fire looking for remains. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2858.0s)]
*  In the immediate aftermath of the fire, there were nearly 1300 people unaccounted for. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2865.0s)]
*  That number has fallen to 25. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2871.0s)]
*  How do you check every site? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2875.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's unprecedented. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2877.0s)]
*  We have brought in search teams from all throughout California, urban search rescue, coroners teams, forensic anthropologists, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2879.0s)]
*  to see if we can determine whether or not there are human remains there. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2888.0s)]
*  And if there are, of course we want to recover them and do what's necessary to return those remains to the family. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2891.0s)]
*  Can you tell me what the search team is doing behind us right now? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2896.0s)]
*  Because this fire burns so hot and so intensely, those remains are often completely consumed or nearly completely consumed. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2900.0s)]
*  And so these guys are looking for bones or bone fragments, which is why we have the anthropologists here to help identify those. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2908.0s)]
*  Search crews and volunteer anthropologists and medical examiners meticulously sifted through ash and debris, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2914.0s)]
*  as though on an archaeological dig, zeroing in on bathrooms, front doors, porches, places people might seek shelter or get trapped. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2924.0s)]
*  It was detailed, sacred work. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2935.0s)]
*  Remains were removed in blue body bags. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2939.0s)]
*  Some, the charred fragments, fit in brown paper bags. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2944.0s)]
*  All the body bags were brought to the morgue in Sacramento. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2948.0s)]
*  So once you get these remains, how are you trying to identify who the victim is? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2952.0s)]
*  Early on, we were able to use some of the more traditional means of identifying human remains, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2959.0s)]
*  including fingerprints, dental records, things of that nature. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2965.0s)]
*  And we'll continue to do that where that's possible. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2969.0s)]
*  But at this point, what we're finding, we're going to mostly have to rely upon DNA analysis. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2972.0s)]
*  In mass casualty disasters, identifying remains using DNA normally takes months. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2978.0s)]
*  The sheriff turned to a new rapid DNA identification technology. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2985.0s)]
*  It was used here for the first time in a disaster zone. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2990.0s)]
*  Inventor Dr. Richard Seldin says he can identify remains in just hours. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=2995.0s)]
*  These victims were incinerated. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3002.0s)]
*  How much material do you need to analyze to come up with a match? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3006.0s)]
*  Just a swab, a Q-tip that had been rubbed against the right tissue, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3013.0s)]
*  or a small fragment of bone, sometimes a small fragment of muscle or liver. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3018.0s)]
*  That very small fragment would allow us to get the DNA ID and in many, many cases solve the case, make the identification. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3023.0s)]
*  Did you fear or worry that you might not be able to get some material that you could use to identify people? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3032.0s)]
*  I was shocked when I saw the first remains, the kind of samples I handled. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3040.0s)]
*  I was pretty sure it weren't going to work. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3045.0s)]
*  I told our technical team, let's do it anyway, five percent chance. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3047.0s)]
*  And the first eight samples all worked perfectly. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3051.0s)]
*  Seldin set up shop in a rented RV in the coroner's parking lot. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3054.0s)]
*  He took a process that once required an entire lab and trunked it down to a piece of plastic. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3059.0s)]
*  Swabs of body tissue or bone are placed inside what he calls the chip, where DNA is purified and separated. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3067.0s)]
*  The results are matched with DNA samples provided by relatives. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3076.0s)]
*  By the end of last week, 41 victims had been identified, 31 of them with rapid DNA. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3080.0s)]
*  Has the technology proven true to the promise? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3088.0s)]
*  Yes, we've been very, very pleased with the technology, not only in terms of its ability to confirm the identities, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3091.0s)]
*  but the speed with which it's able to do that. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3099.0s)]
*  The longer that process is, the worse it is for the family, in my view. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3102.0s)]
*  Seventy-eight-year-old Marie Weahey lived alone in the deep woods just outside Paradise. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3107.0s)]
*  Her children, Bonnie and Tommy and his wife Lisa, last heard from Marie the night before the fire. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3114.0s)]
*  She said, I love you and I love you too. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3121.0s)]
*  I haven't spoke to her since. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3125.0s)]
*  For 12 days, they searched and hoped to find Marie in a shelter. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3128.0s)]
*  They heard the sheriff was encouraging relatives of the missing to provide DNA samples. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3133.0s)]
*  Five days after Bonnie and Tommy gave their swabs, a match was made. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3139.0s)]
*  Their mother's remains were found in her truck not far from her house. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3144.0s)]
*  What does that knowing do for you? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3149.0s)]
*  We know she's been found. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3152.0s)]
*  It's on the road to recovery. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3154.0s)]
*  I don't know if you can ever say we'll ever recover from this, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3157.0s)]
*  but it gives us peace of mind to know that we can try to get some closure and that we have found her. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3160.0s)]
*  She's not going to be missing forever. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3168.0s)]
*  No. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3171.0s)]
*  The campfire destroyed just about everything in Paradise. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3172.0s)]
*  After fires like this, nature has a way of rebounding. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3177.0s)]
*  The question is, can Paradise? [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3181.0s)]
*  On the morning of November 8th, there was a thriving community, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3185.0s)]
*  and in a matter of hours, it's wiped out, it's gone. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3191.0s)]
*  How do you recover from something like this? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3195.0s)]
*  Well, when that happens, I'll let you know, but we have a long road ahead of us. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3198.0s)]
*  It's summer in Australia, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3225.0s)]
*  and it's been a season from hell. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3254.0s)]
*  Raging fires have devastated the continent, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3257.0s)]
*  scorching a reported 27 million acres and killing 33 people. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3260.0s)]
*  Bushfires are a part of life in Australia, and they're often deadly. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3266.0s)]
*  But the scale of these fires is unprecedented. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3270.0s)]
*  Areas across multiple states have ignited. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3274.0s)]
*  Australian cities have suffocated in smoke on some days, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3277.0s)]
*  giving residents the worst air quality in the world. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3281.0s)]
*  And according to one estimate, a billion animals have been killed. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3284.0s)]
*  Scientists say climate change is transforming Australia's environment, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3289.0s)]
*  making it hotter and drier, and exposing it to longer, more intense fire seasons. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3293.0s)]
*  The fires started unusually early in September, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3300.0s)]
*  and when we visited the continent this month, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3303.0s)]
*  we found that Australia is still burning. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3306.0s)]
*  The fires have devoured forests like rivers of lava, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3312.0s)]
*  smoke blanketing the landscape, the skies turning marmalade in the middle of the day. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3316.0s)]
*  It's been a black summer down under, and it's not over yet. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3323.0s)]
*  It sometimes feels as if Australia is at war, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3329.0s)]
*  doing battle with insatiable flames that are fuelled by record heat, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3332.0s)]
*  high winds, and a country parched by drought. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3336.0s)]
*  And this is what's been left behind in towns like Kabargo, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3342.0s)]
*  five hours south of Sydney, where Marilyn Mills was trapped inside her burning house. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3346.0s)]
*  So the fire came up through here, is that right? [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3352.0s)]
*  It started coming up here, just straight, and I thought, I'm just going to burn to death. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3354.0s)]
*  It sounds as if you were convinced that you were going to die. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3360.0s)]
*  And I just thought, just die. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3364.0s)]
*  You wanted to die at that point? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3368.0s)]
*  Yeah, if I couldn't have killed myself I would have done it in a second, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3370.0s)]
*  rather than burn to death. It was so hot. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3374.0s)]
*  Oh my god! [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3380.0s)]
*  60 miles away on the coast, the scenes on New Year's Eve were like a modern-day Dunkirk. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3381.0s)]
*  The fires forced people to retreat to the beaches, as flying embers gusted across the sand. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3388.0s)]
*  They actually had to jump into the ocean to escape. The fires went right to the edge. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3395.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen that before, people having to shelter on the beach and in the water? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3399.0s)]
*  On a massive scale, over hundreds of miles, in multiple communities, no, that's just unprecedented. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3404.0s)]
*  Greg Mullins was there, an experienced fire captain battling towering flames. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3411.0s)]
*  The wind was howling. When the fire came through, it sounded like a 747 jet landing. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3419.0s)]
*  So the sounds, the sights, it was just, it was apocalyptic. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3427.0s)]
*  I don't like this. No, out, out, out, out. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3431.0s)]
*  Mullins says he'd never seen a blaze move that quickly. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3435.0s)]
*  At one stage I saw kangaroos come out of the bush on fire and then just drop dead on the roadway. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3439.0s)]
*  And I've never, ever seen that before, because they're fast animals. They know where to go. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3445.0s)]
*  This time-lapse video from a dash cam shows how firefighters were forced to scramble in the face of rapidly approaching flames. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3450.0s)]
*  In less than two minutes, the fire consumed anything that didn't make it out. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3458.0s)]
*  Hundreds of bushfires have burned for weeks on end, some of them merging into mega fires. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3464.0s)]
*  And firefighters on the front lines say nature has gone awry. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3471.0s)]
*  I saw fire behaviour that I didn't expect and what I learned later was that the fire had created its own weather system. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3476.0s)]
*  What do you mean the fire had created its own weather system? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3484.0s)]
*  Big fires can form storm clouds, which then you have an inrush of air at the bottom, you have downbursts, just like a normal thunderstorm. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3488.0s)]
*  You have lightning that can start fires 20, 25 miles away and firefighters can lose their lives. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3496.0s)]
*  So one night an eight-ton fire truck was picked up by a downburst and put on its roof and killed a firefighter and injured the rest of them. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3502.0s)]
*  To drop fire retardant, Australia is relying on borrowed flying tankers from North America. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3512.0s)]
*  One of the planes went down in smoky conditions last month, killing three American firefighters on board. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3520.0s)]
*  We're so indebted to those people and every firefighter felt it, three of our brothers, albeit from the US, lost their lives trying to help us. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3528.0s)]
*  Australia's firefighters are nearly all volunteers, courageous but exhausted. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3538.0s)]
*  They're affectionately known as firees and we saw them protecting suburban homes. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3545.0s)]
*  This fire is burning out of control and it's just 25 miles from Canberra, Australia's capital city. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3551.0s)]
*  And what makes things even more dangerous are the conditions. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3558.0s)]
*  It's windy today, it's bone dry and it's nearly 110 degrees. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3561.0s)]
*  And it's the changing climate that's at the heart of the problem, according to scientists. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3568.0s)]
*  2019 was the hottest and the driest year in Australia's history. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3573.0s)]
*  So we actually saw temperature records be broken all over the country. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3577.0s)]
*  Joelle Gurgis is a climate scientist at the Australian National University [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3583.0s)]
*  and is a lead author of an upcoming United Nations report on climate change. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3588.0s)]
*  This is the type of summer you might not have expected till the middle of the century based on past projections. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3593.0s)]
*  So I think this is really redefining what it means to actually be living through a period of rapid climate change. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3598.0s)]
*  So you're saying you would have expected this kind of scenario that we saw this summer to happen in 2050? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3605.0s)]
*  Yeah, potentially, middle of the century. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3611.0s)]
*  Are you shocked? [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3613.0s)]
*  Of course I'm shocked. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3614.0s)]
*  Gurgis says Australia is more vulnerable to climate change than any other developed nation, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3615.0s)]
*  in part because it's the driest inhabited continent. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3621.0s)]
*  When it comes to climate change, is Australia a bellwether for the rest of the world? [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3625.0s)]
*  I think this summer has been a real wake-up call for most Australians. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3629.0s)]
*  And myself as a climate scientist, seeing the extreme level of heat and the bushfires [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3633.0s)]
*  and the drought conditions playing out so catastrophically has been, I think, a wake-up call to the world. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3640.0s)]
*  We have been mugged by the reality of climate change in this summer. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3646.0s)]
*  Malcolm Turnbull is a political conservative who served as Australia's Prime Minister up until August of 2018. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3651.0s)]
*  This is climate change in the raw. This is what we have been told to expect for years. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3659.0s)]
*  When you were Prime Minister, were you warned that the fires were getting worse? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3665.0s)]
*  Of course. Everyone has known this. We've been warned by the climate scientists. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3669.0s)]
*  Everyone has been aware of this except for those who, well, the climate change deniers are aware of it, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3674.0s)]
*  but they choose to deny reality. It has been a challenging time. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3681.0s)]
*  Turnbull was bounced out of office by the right wing of his own party, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3687.0s)]
*  largely over his support for cutting carbon emissions. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3691.0s)]
*  The right wing climate deniers treat an issue of science and physics and fact as though it was a question of ideology, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3695.0s)]
*  and their conduct is not just idiotic, it is downright dangerous. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3704.0s)]
*  Dangerous for us here in Australia and right around the world. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3710.0s)]
*  You're talking about people in your own party. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3714.0s)]
*  Of course I am, absolutely. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3717.0s)]
*  Dangerous and idiotic. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3718.0s)]
*  Well, of course it is dangerous and idiotic not to be taking the strongest action to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3719.0s)]
*  Turnbull was replaced by Scott Morrison, who has minimised climate change. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3729.0s)]
*  He famously stood up in parliament in 2017 and taunted his opponents with a lump of coal. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3734.0s)]
*  This is coal. Don't be afraid. Don't be scared. It's coal. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3741.0s)]
*  Morrison has prioritised protecting Australia's mining industry. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3746.0s)]
*  Coal is the country's second largest export. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3751.0s)]
*  And members of the current government argue it's not Australia's responsibility to act on climate change, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3754.0s)]
*  since the country only produces about 1% of global emissions. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3761.0s)]
*  Isn't there some truth in that? I mean, if the US doesn't act, if China and India don't act to cut emissions, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3766.0s)]
*  it doesn't matter very much what Australia does. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3772.0s)]
*  Well, if we don't act, if we don't act, a wealthy, advanced economy facing the harsh reality of climate change, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3774.0s)]
*  if we don't act and show leadership, why would anyone else act? [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3783.0s)]
*  With his country on fire, the current Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, took his family on a Hawaiian vacation. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3788.0s)]
*  When he returned home, he was given a cold shoulder as he tried to comfort victims in the fire zones. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3795.0s)]
*  We only had four trucks to defend our town. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3802.0s)]
*  He was heckled by seething residents. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3808.0s)]
*  No, you're an idiot, mate. You really are. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3811.0s)]
*  Including in the hard-hit town of Kabago, where Marilyn Mills lives. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3814.0s)]
*  A lot of people in Kabago are angry with the Prime Minister. Do you share those feelings? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3819.0s)]
*  Well, he didn't light the fire. What can he do? He's just a bloke with a whole bunch of people under him and they're all idiots. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3824.0s)]
*  So for you, it sounds like it's the entire government that you're angry with? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3832.0s)]
*  Well, they need to have a look at what threatens Australia. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3837.0s)]
*  Fire threatens Australia. That's our big thing, fire. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3840.0s)]
*  Fire, drought, all those sorts of things. That's what they need to focus on. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3844.0s)]
*  Greg Mullin says he and 22 former fire and emergency service chiefs from all over Australia [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3850.0s)]
*  wrote to Prime Minister Morrison last April, warning him of a looming catastrophe and requesting more resources to fight bushfires. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3857.0s)]
*  And what was the response? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3866.0s)]
*  Oh, that he was too busy to meet with us. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3867.0s)]
*  He refused to meet with you? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3869.0s)]
*  Point blank. Told us to buzz off, basically. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3871.0s)]
*  Why? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3874.0s)]
*  We've been told by senior public servants in Canberra that because we uttered two horrible words, climate change, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3875.0s)]
*  we were discounted as being activists and we would not get a meeting at any stage with the Prime Minister. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3882.0s)]
*  We wanted to interview the Prime Minister about the devastating fires and their connection with climate change, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3889.0s)]
*  but he declined our requests, as did other members of his government. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3895.0s)]
*  Scott Morrison has admitted that he made mistakes in the handling of this crisis, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3899.0s)]
*  but what he has not done is make any change to reduce this country's carbon emissions. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3904.0s)]
*  Climate scientist Joelle Gergus says the future of Australia hangs in the balance. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3911.0s)]
*  Are the Australian people being betrayed by their politicians? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3917.0s)]
*  At this moment, I think it is really reckless and potentially criminal, because we actually know enough about the science now. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3921.0s)]
*  I think the science is crystal clear and I think the impacts are now playing out. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3930.0s)]
*  Now, remember that Australia is actually an extraordinary continent. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3935.0s)]
*  We have the highest level of plants and animals that are found here and nowhere else on earth. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3939.0s)]
*  Australia's most iconic animals, koalas and kangaroos, have fared terribly, innocent victims of the fires. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3945.0s)]
*  One scientist estimates at least a billion animals have died. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3954.0s)]
*  We went to Kangaroo Island, off Australia's southern coast, where tens of thousands of koalas are believed to have been killed. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3960.0s)]
*  48% of the island has burned. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3968.0s)]
*  Surviving koalas have been brought to a makeshift care centre, the living room of a family that runs a wildlife park. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3971.0s)]
*  The baby koalas, some only months old, receive special attention. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3979.0s)]
*  Many koalas were singed on their paws and arrived dehydrated. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3985.0s)]
*  A mass unit has been set up to sedate them and treat their wounds, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3990.0s)]
*  so they may one day return to their habitat, or what's left of it. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3994.0s)]
*  Feeding grounds have been reduced to char, and just before we left the island, we came across this hungry kangaroo, scouring the ashes for something to eat. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=3999.0s)]
*  In the last two weeks, it's finally rained, giving everyone some respite and hope that this most brutal season of fires may be coming to an end. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=4013.0s)]
*  But the scars remain. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=4023.0s)]
*  In what used to be pristine wilderness, ringing with birdsong and brimming with wildlife, there is silence. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=4025.0s)]
*  The music of the forest, in the middle of the Australian summer, is gone. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntfQJdBc-M&t=4036.0s)]
