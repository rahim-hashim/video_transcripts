# Submarines | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8)
*  During the Cold War, while Americans and Soviets were keeping their eyes on the skies under [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=0.0s)]
*  the sea, hundreds of nuclear-armed submarines from both sides were keeping their eyes on [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=17.72s)]
*  each other, cruising almost invisibly off each other's coasts. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=23.12s)]
*  They played a sometimes deadly game of cat and mouse, each side shadowing the other, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=27.38s)]
*  ready to destroy the other at the first provocation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=31.9s)]
*  It was spying on the grandest and most secret scale. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=35.739999999999995s)]
*  But now for the first time, those secrets are beginning to emerge. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=39.739999999999995s)]
*  For ten years, John Craven was the chief scientist of the U.S. Navy, a civilian whose knowledge [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=44.9s)]
*  of underwater engineering earned him enormous power and a virtual blank check from the Pentagon. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=50.56s)]
*  He was the godfather of a submarine called the USS Halibut. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=57.28s)]
*  It was probably the most classified thing I've worked on in my life. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  You were talking about a spy ship here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=64.78s)]
*  We were talking about a spy ship. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=66.9s)]
*  Totally. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=68.3s)]
*  Totally. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=69.3s)]
*  We were talking about a spy ship totally. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=70.3s)]
*  The official version told to Congress was that the ship was a deep sea rescue vehicle. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=72.08s)]
*  In fact, Craven was creating something out of Jules Verne. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=77.38s)]
*  Halibut could go deeper than any sub. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=81.86s)]
*  Its camera-equipped robots could prowl the ocean floor. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=84.06s)]
*  The cost of the ship went 2,000 percent over the budget given to Congress. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=87.92s)]
*  Craven says many cost overruns are not the boondoggles they've been made out to be. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=93.44s)]
*  Those of us who've been in the intelligence business know that the $200-watt wrench is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=99.08s)]
*  not a waste of the taxpayers' money. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  It wasn't paid for the wrench. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=104.42s)]
*  It was paid for something else. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=106.0s)]
*  What it really was was a cover story for one of the great spy operations of the Cold War. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=107.94s)]
*  Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew broke the secrets of the underwater Cold War in a new [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=112.66s)]
*  book called Blind Man's Bluff. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=118.26s)]
*  They say that in the operations of Halibut, not even the crew knew what the ship was up to. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=121.1s)]
*  They would tell these men when they signed them up for these special projects that they [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=127.22s)]
*  were going on to research vessels. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=131.02s)]
*  It took a while before they learned it was really James Bond, not Jacques Cousteau. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=133.58s)]
*  And in 1968, when Halibut was dispatched on its first assignment, a search, even the crew [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=137.94s)]
*  had no idea where it was going. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=144.68s)]
*  The navigator knew that he had to mess up the navigation so that the crew thought they [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=147.32s)]
*  were someplace else in the world than they were. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=152.0s)]
*  The people who were doing the search were not told what they were searching for. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=154.92s)]
*  The mission, the hunt for K-129, a Soviet nuclear-armed submarine that had vanished [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=158.64s)]
*  in the Pacific. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=164.88s)]
*  The Soviet leadership had no idea where the K-129 submarine was, and they were panicky. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=166.4s)]
*  She was carrying code machines and nuclear missiles, a potential intelligence bonanza [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=172.62s)]
*  for the Americans. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=178.1s)]
*  This would be the most terrifying thing I can think of for a leader of any nation, is [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  to worry about their ballistic missile submarine. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=185.86s)]
*  Where is it and why is it gone? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=188.06s)]
*  Not even senior Soviet officers were told the sub was missing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  At the time, Admiral Lev Chernavin had command of 40 subs in the Northern Fleet. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=194.98s)]
*  I can't even explain why it was concealed from us. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=200.6s)]
*  In the case of the K-129, the Northern Fleet was kept in the dark. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=206.0s)]
*  To this day, no official Russian explanation for the disappearance has been given. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  But one rumor persists. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=216.76s)]
*  The sinking of the K-129 was caused by a collision with the U.S. submarine Swordfish. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=220.36s)]
*  Shortly after it had lost contact with the K-129, Soviet intelligence had tracked the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=226.66000000000003s)]
*  American spy sub USS Swordfish, extensively damaged, pulling into a military shipyard [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=232.38000000000002s)]
*  in Japan. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=239.12s)]
*  Swordfish's logs confirm a stopover in Japan, but the U.S. Navy denies there was any encounter [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=241.36s)]
*  with a K-129. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  The American commander of Swordfish says absolutely there was no collision that he hit an iceberg. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=250.4s)]
*  You don't believe him. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  As far as I know, there are no icebergs in the area. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=263.12s)]
*  Maybe he tried to find some to hit. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  While the Soviets were still in the dark about K-129, Halibut found it, lying three miles [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=271.68s)]
*  down on the ocean floor. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=277.44s)]
*  To this day, the U.S. Navy will not discuss the mission. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=279.41999999999996s)]
*  But Halibut's cameras ended up taking 22,000 pictures of this submarine, including one [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=284.08s)]
*  incredible shot of a skeleton of a Soviet sailor lying on the seabed near the boat, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=292.17999999999995s)]
*  wearing a sheepskin fall-weather jacket and black boots. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=299.44s)]
*  Irina Zurovina was married to the K-129's chief engineer. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=304.6s)]
*  Irina Kovzar's husband was the captain. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=309.04s)]
*  I still don't believe that he's gone. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=315.88s)]
*  Do you understand? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  Every time I see a sailor in a Navy uniform, I run ahead of him to see if this is my Volga. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=319.8s)]
*  The families of the crew were told nothing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  For 30 years, nobody would bother to think that they had died heroically in the line [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=330.32s)]
*  of duty. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=335.12s)]
*  At the time, we received an idiotic document. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=336.08s)]
*  It does not say they were killed, but rather that they were found perished. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=341.08s)]
*  As far as the Russians were concerned, the case was closed on sub-K-129. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=347.68s)]
*  But for the CIA, 22,000 pictures were not enough. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=353.2s)]
*  The CIA wanted the sub-lock, stock and missiles and spent six years and a half a billion dollars [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  secretly trying to raise it with a ship called the Glomar Explorer. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=364.6s)]
*  It was mostly a failure. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=369.48s)]
*  In 1975, the New York Times got wind of it and so did the world. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=371.32s)]
*  I was working in customs at the airport. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  I checked all the foreign newspapers and magazines brought in by passengers. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=378.2s)]
*  That's how I learned. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=382.68s)]
*  Among the few things the Glomar did raise were the remains of six Soviet sailors. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=384.48s)]
*  On board the ship, CIA technicians held a makeshift burial at sea for the men. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=390.24s)]
*  They taped it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=402.12s)]
*  It was kept secret until 1992, when the tape was presented to Russian President Boris Yeltsin [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=403.8s)]
*  by then CIA director Robert Gates. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  My message to him was that even at the height of the Cold War, in the darkest days, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  we had treated these Soviet sailors with respect and with dignity. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  Gates says the underwater intelligence wars made for some of the most harrowing espionage missions [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=423.76s)]
*  of the Cold War. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=429.8s)]
*  Both Presidents Carter and Reagan were, I think, in awe of the courage as well as the skill [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=431.64s)]
*  of these people who carried out these missions. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=438.72s)]
*  Some of their experiences were sort of out of Tom Clancy novels. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=441.36s)]
*  Even more thrilling, more dangerous than the hunt for Red October was Halibut's next mission, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=447.04s)]
*  to find and place recording devices on Soviet naval communications cables deep under the Arctic ice. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=452.92s)]
*  For two decades, Halibut and other subs sent divers down to pick up the tapes and replace them. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=460.2s)]
*  If caught, the subs had orders to self-destruct. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=467.4s)]
*  The men knew that if they were close to being caught, that they would disappear and nobody [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=471.28s)]
*  would ever tell their families where they'd been, what they'd been doing, or how they had died. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=476.44s)]
*  A kind of American kamikaze in a certain way. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=480.23999999999995s)]
*  If the situation is bad enough. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=483.23999999999995s)]
*  It could have been. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=486.96s)]
*  How would the Soviets have reacted if they had caught one of the submarines in the act [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=488.2s)]
*  of tapping into their cable? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=494.2s)]
*  You were right inside their minds. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=496.11999999999995s)]
*  I mean, this was their private communications to each other. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=498.24s)]
*  I believe that the information from this source and from other intelligence sources, in fact, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=501.88s)]
*  played a very important role in keeping the Cold War cold. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=508.44s)]
*  One threat to the balance of terror came in 1970. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=514.36s)]
*  A new class of Soviet sub nicknamed Yankee by the United States. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=517.68s)]
*  It was so quiet that American intelligence feared it might roam at will undetected off [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=522.6s)]
*  the US coast. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=528.72s)]
*  Then along came Captain Chester Whitey Mack. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  It was just a tone that went by. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=534.12s)]
*  I mean, just a blip. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=536.6s)]
*  In a minute you can lose him. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=539.84s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=541.28s)]
*  He could be anywhere out there in that big ocean. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=542.28s)]
*  And it's a big ocean. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=545.0s)]
*  Washington ordered Mack and his sub, the USS Lapon, to follow that blip. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=546.76s)]
*  That barely audible tone was one of those new Soviet subs armed with 24 long-range ballistic missiles. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=552.84s)]
*  It was truly a game of blind man's bluff. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=560.36s)]
*  There were times that we passed over under each other because that submarine was so quiet [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=564.1600000000001s)]
*  that if we got beyond 3,000 yards, we lost all track of him. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=570.6400000000001s)]
*  We spent 47 days with this guy within a mile. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=574.44s)]
*  The 47-day shadow in constant danger of a collision became the stuff of legend among [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=578.88s)]
*  submariners. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=585.64s)]
*  Mack and his crew received a presidential citation in secret. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=586.64s)]
*  Their success also proved that the Soviets could run but could not hide. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=591.5600000000001s)]
*  Other American subs, like the USS TOTOG, were not quite so successful. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=597.24s)]
*  This is TOTOG. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=604.48s)]
*  Moving. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=605.88s)]
*  I'm turning. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=606.88s)]
*  He does not hear me. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=607.92s)]
*  He sped up. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=609.92s)]
*  The USS TOTOG was ordered to follow Soviet Captain Boris Bagdasarian, whose sub was considered [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=611.92s)]
*  a threat to U.S. carriers stationed off the coast of Vietnam. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=619.92s)]
*  Bagdasarian says the TOTOG was reckless. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=623.92s)]
*  Both ships were badly damaged in the collision, and Washington and Moscow had not a clue how [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=627.92s)]
*  the other might react. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=633.92s)]
*  The Americans spent several days looking for their submarine in the collision area. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  The TOTOG couldn't signal back because I had smashed its radio antennas. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=641.9599999999999s)]
*  Without its antennas, it was floating like a cigar. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=647.9599999999999s)]
*  His sub suffered a 12-foot gash 10 feet wide. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=653.9599999999999s)]
*  It seemed an eternity before he regained control. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=657.9599999999999s)]
*  The Americans thought that you had been sunk. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=661.9599999999999s)]
*  I found that out later. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=665.0s)]
*  The Russians let the Americans think the U.S. had sunk a Soviet sub with all hands. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=669.0s)]
*  The Americans never even acknowledged there had been a collision. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=674.0s)]
*  Boris kept a souvenir of the affair, a piece of TOTOG, as he continued his career underwater, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=678.0s)]
*  mostly off the coast of California. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=686.0s)]
*  Was it like a game between you and the American submarines? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=688.0s)]
*  If it was a game, it was a cruel one. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=695.0s)]
*  It was a game for real men. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=699.0s)]
*  Real men, certainly for their families. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=706.0s)]
*  This fall, at a church in St. Petersburg, the widows of the K-129 crew joined the families of both sides, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=708.0s)]
*  Russians and Americans, who came to honor sons, husbands, and fathers lost in the war that never was. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=716.0s)]
*  The Russians lost several hundred men in accidents, the Americans at least 200. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=724.04s)]
*  USS Thresher, USS Scorpion, both lost with all hands. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=730.04s)]
*  And the men who made it home. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=738.04s)]
*  John Craven now teaches oceanography. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=740.04s)]
*  Those submarines that were so much a part of his life remain silent sentinels. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=743.04s)]
*  Hi, Sue, this is Whitey Mack. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=750.04s)]
*  Whitey Mack has traded those years of excitement for life in sails. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=752.0799999999999s)]
*  Bye-bye. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=756.0799999999999s)]
*  Boris Bagdasserian suffered radiation exposure from a badly shielded nuclear submarine reactor [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  and is in constant pain. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=765.0799999999999s)]
*  The submarines he devoted his life to have become so much junk, rusting, dying old war horses. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=768.0799999999999s)]
*  All those years of spying and submarines and the billions and billions of dollars, did it serve any purpose at all? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=776.12s)]
*  Apart from the decorations, honors and respect, prematurely gray hair and broken health, nothing else. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=788.12s)]
*  The US Navy says it will construct a new submarine base in Washington state for the Trident fleet. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=806.12s)]
*  Ten submarines still to be built at a cost of 11 billion dollars. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=818.12s)]
*  That figure to include the Trident missiles too. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=822.12s)]
*  The Trident program is being pushed even though we have a strategic arms limitation treaty with the Russians. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=825.12s)]
*  We are going to build a new submarine with new missiles to take the place of what we have already, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=831.16s)]
*  Polaris and Poseidon submarines like the one behind me. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=836.16s)]
*  Whatever the name, Polaris, Poseidon or Trident. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=840.16s)]
*  An SSBN, the Navy's shorthand for submersible ship ballistic nuclear, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=843.16s)]
*  is really nothing more than an underwater launching platform for ballistic missiles. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=848.16s)]
*  Nuclear weapons designed to prevent a nuclear war. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=853.16s)]
*  The big difference between an SSBN and an old fashioned ICBM site is that the SSBN can move. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=861.16s)]
*  And that's what it does from the freezing waters of the North Pole to the warm waters of the Indian Ocean. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=868.16s)]
*  Like the legendary Flying Dutchman, a missile submarine is destined to travel the seas without rest. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=873.16s)]
*  A specter ship, an omen of disaster. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=879.16s)]
*  For if ever a missile sub fires its weapons in anger, it will signal doomsday. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=882.16s)]
*  You don't hear much about these submarines. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=888.1999999999999s)]
*  The Navy keeps a very low profile on them for security reasons. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=890.1999999999999s)]
*  But 60 Minutes was allowed to take a short cruise on one recently, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=894.1999999999999s)]
*  the Alexander Hamilton, to get some idea of what they're like. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=898.1999999999999s)]
*  Commander Stan Skorupski, captain of the Hamilton, took her down. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=902.1999999999999s)]
*  Submerge the ship, make your depth 6-5 feet. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=906.1999999999999s)]
*  6-5 feet, aye. Chief of the watch on the 1MC, dive, dive. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=908.1999999999999s)]
*  1MC, dive, dive, aye. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=912.1999999999999s)]
*  Dive, dive! [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=914.1999999999999s)]
*  150 feet. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=918.1999999999999s)]
*  This is the missile compartment of the USS Alexander Hamilton, SSBN 617. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=926.1999999999999s)]
*  Inside these fat tubes sits more destructive power than has been loosed on Earth since men first started bombing one another. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=932.1999999999999s)]
*  16 launching tubes, each stuffed with a missile capped by an atomic bomb. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=940.1999999999999s)]
*  16 of these launching tubes on this single platform, each missile able to push its warheads 1,700 miles. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=945.24s)]
*  16 nuclear warheads, each armed with enough destructive power to pulverize a city like Moscow, or Washington, or Leningrad, or New York, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=952.24s)]
*  or if you will, Peking or Shanghai, for all of them are within range of a missile submarine lurking in the deep recesses of the ocean. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=962.24s)]
*  Subdued voices, the sailors train to stay quiet for submarines are built for silent running. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=975.24s)]
*  Subdued lighting too, no brilliant sunrises or sunsets in this nether world. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1001.28s)]
*  Instead the blinking lights of computers and the dial lights on hundreds of electronic indicators in the missile control room. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1007.28s)]
*  We talked with some of the Hamilton's crew. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1014.28s)]
*  Has it ever occurred to you guys that the entire Soviet Navy is looking for the Alexander Hamilton and its sister ships? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1017.28s)]
*  We all know that they're looking for us, but it's something you just have to live with if you're going to ride these things. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1023.28s)]
*  Do you ever think about the missiles themselves and the finality of what they stand for? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1030.32s)]
*  Oh yes, you walk by them every day and you know they're in there. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1035.32s)]
*  I think everyone probably has some inner thoughts about it, what they can do and everything. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1041.32s)]
*  The business of just being underwater for 60 days at a time, out of touch with the world, that never gets on your nerves? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1048.32s)]
*  It gets on your nerves at times, it really does. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1057.36s)]
*  You know you're away from everything, family, the United States and cities, but you get used to it. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1061.36s)]
*  Pretty strange experience coming on here for the first time. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1073.36s)]
*  I know myself, the whole first patrol, I naturally thought about my family and everything a lot. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1076.36s)]
*  But the main thing I wanted to see more than anything in the whole world, the thing that possessed me most, was seeing a tree. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1081.3999999999999s)]
*  Just a simple tree, I just wanted to see one. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1088.3999999999999s)]
*  Captain, suppose you woke up one morning fed up with everything, including the Russians, and you wanted to do it once and for all. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1091.3999999999999s)]
*  Could you fire your missiles? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1099.3999999999999s)]
*  No, I could not myself fire my missiles. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1101.3999999999999s)]
*  It was just impossible. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1104.3999999999999s)]
*  And this is a topic before I came into this program, which concerned me, and after 10 years with Polaris submarines, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1106.44s)]
*  I feel totally assured that no one man can possibly initiate the order to launch missiles. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1113.44s)]
*  What is the chain of command for that final order? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1120.44s)]
*  Where does it start, through what layers of command does it go before it gets to you? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1122.44s)]
*  It's a very direct chain of command. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1127.44s)]
*  As we know, the only person who can authorize the release of these missiles is the President. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1130.44s)]
*  And the President, through his National Command Authority, which is the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1134.48s)]
*  would pass the order to release the missiles through only one intermediary, which is Commander-in-Chief Atlantic, who I work for. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1141.48s)]
*  It works out such that the missiles belong to the President and the ship belongs to the Commander-in-Chief Atlantic. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1150.48s)]
*  Well then, how long does all of that take? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1157.48s)]
*  This could happen in a very brief time, in that once the order is given, we will in fact receive it. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1160.52s)]
*  Well, you say a brief time. You've had that grill. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1167.52s)]
*  What I'm thinking of is, when the President gets news, let's say, that missiles are coming our way, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1170.52s)]
*  how long does it take him to let you know to let your missiles go? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1176.52s)]
*  Well, I can't really discuss times, but yes, we do, in fact, on a regular basis try to assure ourselves [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1180.52s)]
*  that we are capable of receiving this order. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1187.56s)]
*  With or without orders, Captain Skorupski cannot fire the missiles by himself. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1190.56s)]
*  The failed safe system requires that two additional officers participate. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1195.56s)]
*  When you think about what goes on here aboard the Alexander Hamilton and what your mission is, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1200.56s)]
*  if those 16 missiles ever go, that means that the United States has been attacked. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1204.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1211.56s)]
*  And that may mean that you'll come back to a pulverized, incinerated country, if at all. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1212.6s)]
*  There's a possibility of that. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1221.6s)]
*  All of us know what we're out here for and we're all aware of it. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1224.6s)]
*  There's times when the awareness becomes more acute, like during our battle stations drills. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1227.6s)]
*  That's when you become really acutely aware of the fact that what you're here for. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1232.6s)]
*  Day to day, we don't talk about them at all. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1237.6s)]
*  It's a pretty terrible thing to think about. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1240.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe that's the reason we don't talk about it too much. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1242.6399999999999s)]
*  Do we talk about it? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1244.6399999999999s)]
*  Not really. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1246.6399999999999s)]
*  Do we face the facts? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1247.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1249.6399999999999s)]
*  The facts include the range of the captain's missiles and how much hiding space in the oceans he has. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1250.6399999999999s)]
*  The longer the range of the missile, the more hiding space. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1256.6399999999999s)]
*  The more seawater in which to prowl, the harder for the Russians to find ships like the Hamilton and destroy them. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1260.6399999999999s)]
*  That is really what's at the heart of the Trident debate. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1266.6399999999999s)]
*  How much hiding space do our SSBNs need? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1269.68s)]
*  Is 3 million square miles enough? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1272.68s)]
*  That's what the Poseidon missile gives him. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1275.68s)]
*  Or does he need 15 million square miles of ocean hiding space? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1277.68s)]
*  That's what the Trident I missile with a range of 4,000 miles would provide. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1281.68s)]
*  Or does he need 55 million square miles? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1286.68s)]
*  The serum offered by the Trident II missile with its 6,000 mile range. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1290.68s)]
*  Is the extra margin of safety worth what it will cost? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1295.72s)]
*  60 minutes put these questions to a brace of Rear Admirals. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1299.72s)]
*  Robert Yogi Kaufman, a former SSBN skipper who now heads the Navy's Trident program. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1302.72s)]
*  And Gene LaRocque, who resigned his commission as Rear Admiral last spring after 31 years in the Navy. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1308.72s)]
*  He heads the Center for Defense Information, a research outfit in Washington that keeps a weather eye on military spending. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1314.72s)]
*  Admiral, why do we need Trident? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1321.72s)]
*  What's wrong with what we've got now? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1323.76s)]
*  Mike, today there's nothing wrong with what we've got. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1325.76s)]
*  Today. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1328.76s)]
*  Today our Polaris Poseidon submarines roam the oceans relatively invulnerable. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1329.76s)]
*  Or let's say they are invulnerable. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1335.76s)]
*  Against today's threat. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1337.76s)]
*  But with the advancing technology that we see ourselves in the anti-submarine warfare field. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1339.76s)]
*  And that we feel the Soviets are capable of developing. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1345.76s)]
*  We can't see that survivability, that invulnerability of our submarine force is guaranteed for the future. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1349.8s)]
*  The proposed Trident submarine that the Navy is asking for may be just as vulnerable to any of these new breakthroughs by the Soviets as the current submarine force is. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1357.8s)]
*  Then what would you suggest instead, Admiral? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1368.8s)]
*  I think that we ought to proceed on the research and development for the Trident 1 missile. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1370.84s)]
*  Which will fit into the existing Poseidon submarines. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1376.84s)]
*  And that will give us an additional 1500 miles of range. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1382.84s)]
*  That will get us up to about 4,000, 4,500 miles. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1386.84s)]
*  That's right. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1389.84s)]
*  And? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1390.84s)]
*  Well that gives you then a greatly increased area for the submarines to operate in. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1391.84s)]
*  Increases it by about 450 percent. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1396.8799999999999s)]
*  The question that I am asking is, is it conceivable that the Trident 1 missile, which can go into the current Poseidon submarine, couldn't do the job effectively. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1401.8799999999999s)]
*  If one of the current Poseidon submarines with the missiles it has available to it can hit and obliterate 160 Soviet cities. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1412.8799999999999s)]
*  One surviving submarine today can destroy 160 Soviet cities. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1421.92s)]
*  That's a fair statement. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1428.92s)]
*  In the absence of any defenses, in the absence of any failure of missiles and so forth. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1430.92s)]
*  But ignoring those, I mean the number is still a large number. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1437.92s)]
*  One of them can destroy 160 Soviet cities. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1440.92s)]
*  That's right. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1443.92s)]
*  A fellow could be tied up at Charleston, South Carolina and fired into the heartland of the Soviet Union from there. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1444.92s)]
*  He could. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1449.92s)]
*  Well then what in the world do you need the Trident submarine for if you have the Trident 1 missile? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1450.96s)]
*  Because by the time we get that missile, which is also about the time that we can get the submarine, Mike, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1453.96s)]
*  these submarines that we have today will be approaching the end of their useful life. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1460.96s)]
*  And we do need, we will require a successor to them for several reasons. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1466.96s)]
*  One, they are noisier than we would like them to be. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1471.96s)]
*  Two, their equipment is wearing out. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1477.0s)]
*  They will get to the point where it will cost us more than we can afford to overhaul them, to keep them running. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1482.0s)]
*  Three, any replacement for these submarines will be expensive even if we went to that same design, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1489.0s)]
*  a Chinese copy of the Polaris Poseidon type submarine. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1499.0s)]
*  It's incumbent upon us to get on with an early introduction of the replacement ship. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1502.04s)]
*  And the replacement ship obviously you feel should be the Trident at a billion dollars a copy, give or take 300 million. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1507.04s)]
*  I certainly do. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1514.04s)]
*  For that kind of money we won't be getting just a new submarine, it'll be a super sub. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1515.04s)]
*  After three years of research and development, the Navy thinks the Trident may turn out to be twice as big as our existing SSBNs. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1520.04s)]
*  A submarine that will displace more water than Russia's only aircraft carrier, the helicopter launching Moskva. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1528.08s)]
*  Why so huge? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1535.08s)]
*  To provide a launching platform for the proposed Trident II missile, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1538.08s)]
*  the monster being designed now to throw multiple warheads 6,000 miles. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1543.08s)]
*  And instead of only 16 launching tubes, there will be perhaps 24 on the Trident. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1548.08s)]
*  But opponents of Trident question whether the super sub will be able to live up to the promises being made by its advocates. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1553.12s)]
*  Admiral Hyman Rickover, the man responsible for development of the nuclear submarine, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1560.12s)]
*  has told the Congress that the Trident will be quieter even if it is twice as big [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1565.12s)]
*  and therefore harder for the Russians to track with their anti-submarine devices. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1570.12s)]
*  With all respect to Admiral Rickover, no one knows how quiet that submarine will be. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1575.12s)]
*  Until we have built it. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1580.1599999999999s)]
*  That's one thing we have learned in the construction of weapons systems. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1583.1599999999999s)]
*  The actual performance is always much better on the drawing board than it ever is when we put it into operation. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1586.1599999999999s)]
*  We won't know if it's quieter until after it's built. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1593.1599999999999s)]
*  There is nothing really in the design of the Trident submarine which is cloud nine type technology. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1596.1599999999999s)]
*  For example, the Russian submarine is a very small, very small, very small submarine. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1603.1599999999999s)]
*  The reactor plant, the propulsion plant that we're going to use in the Trident submarine, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1609.2s)]
*  in principle has already been operating. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1615.2s)]
*  We've been operating a ship at sea with a smaller addition of this propulsion plant. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1618.2s)]
*  We know what it will do. We know it's quieter. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1624.2s)]
*  The Navy is less sure of what the Russians are up to, even though it has film of Russian submarine activity. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1627.2s)]
*  The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty limits the number of SSBNs each country can have [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1633.2s)]
*  and the overall number of underwater launching tubes on them. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1638.24s)]
*  But the Red Navy has three times as many subs as we do, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1642.24s)]
*  though they trail right now on the number of ballistic missile subs. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1646.24s)]
*  Under the treaty, they can build more, and they are. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1649.24s)]
*  We don't know exactly what they're doing. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1652.24s)]
*  We're always surprised by what we see. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1654.24s)]
*  Our intelligence lead time often is zero if it exists at all. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1657.24s)]
*  So we don't know what they're doing. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1663.24s)]
*  We don't know what it takes to make them believe that we can have enough weapons [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1666.28s)]
*  to survive their onslaught if they choose to initiate an attack. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1672.28s)]
*  And I suppose he feels the same way about us. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1681.28s)]
*  If we go ahead with the Trident program, we will have still more weapons to attack the Soviet Union. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1685.28s)]
*  Weapons we don't need. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1692.28s)]
*  The Soviets are certain to follow our lead in development of a Trident submarine. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1694.32s)]
*  They've followed us in everything else we have developed. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1699.32s)]
*  Does it ever, I suppose professionally it would be suicide for you to say that it does, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1702.32s)]
*  but anyway, has it ever occurred to you that we are all of us, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1707.32s)]
*  you, the Congress, the taxpayer captives of a mindless momentum in arming? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1711.32s)]
*  I think any of us who think about these things at all seriously wonder when it's all, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1718.36s)]
*  when do we stop? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1725.36s)]
*  What is the logical stopping point? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1726.36s)]
*  I would love to have someone give me or give all of us the finite number [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1729.36s)]
*  by means of which both sides, whoever the adversaries are, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1735.36s)]
*  would consider that they have adequate deterrence. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1739.36s)]
*  What is the most important thing that you think about when you're talking about the trident? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1742.36s)]
*  What is the logical stopping point? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1747.3999999999999s)]
*  How much is enough? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1749.3999999999999s)]
*  When do we cross the threshold from security to overkill? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1751.3999999999999s)]
*  Although the Vietnam War is over for the United States, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1755.3999999999999s)]
*  the Pentagon, with the approval of the White House, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1759.3999999999999s)]
*  is asking for more money for defense spending next year, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1761.3999999999999s)]
*  including another billion dollars for the Trident project [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1765.3999999999999s)]
*  with its new submarine and tailor-made missiles. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1768.3999999999999s)]
*  The administration says the Trident weapon system [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1771.3999999999999s)]
*  will give us more muscle at the salt negotiations. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1774.44s)]
*  Critics say that the deterrent power of our land-based ICBMs [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1777.44s)]
*  plus our strategic bombers plus these Polaris Poseidon submarines [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1781.44s)]
*  give the U.S. plenty of muscle. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1786.44s)]
*  That this instrument of steel and electronic circuitry [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1789.44s)]
*  and fissionable atoms and men is enough. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1793.44s)]
*  One of the key questions of this presidential campaign [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1804.44s)]
*  is who has the health and temperament to become the next commander-in-chief [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1807.44s)]
*  and assume the unthinkable power to use nuclear weapons. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1811.44s)]
*  The Cold War as we knew it may be over, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1815.44s)]
*  but both the U.S. and Russia still keep enough nuclear weapons [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1818.44s)]
*  on alert to end civilization. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1821.44s)]
*  And now a new Cold War is brewing with both sides [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1824.44s)]
*  developing more sophisticated and more accurate weapons. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1827.44s)]
*  Tonight we're going to show you what this new Cold War looks like [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1831.48s)]
*  from inside the U.S. Strategic Command. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1834.48s)]
*  STRATCOM, as it's called, trains every day [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1837.48s)]
*  for the possibility of nuclear war [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1840.48s)]
*  and takes extraordinary measures to make sure one person [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1843.48s)]
*  and one person only, the President of the United States, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1846.48s)]
*  can give the order to launch a nuclear weapon. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1849.48s)]
*  130, 120, 110, 130, 120, 130, 130, 130, 130, 130, 130, 130, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1852.48s)]
*  120, 140, 140. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1859.52s)]
*  USS Kentucky rising to the surface off the coast of Hawaii. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1865.52s)]
*  Nearly two football fields long, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1869.52s)]
*  it is the deadliest engine of destruction in the American arsenal, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1872.52s)]
*  able to carry almost 200 nuclear warheads [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1875.52s)]
*  atop the missiles loaded beneath those hatches. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1878.52s)]
*  Commander Brian Freck is the captain. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1881.52s)]
*  The warheads that can be carried on my missiles are extremely powerful. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1884.52s)]
*  What do you think about the response to the bomb [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1887.56s)]
*  that leveled Hiroshima? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1890.56s)]
*  Much more powerful than that. Much more powerful than Hiroshima. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1892.56s)]
*  Up to 30 times more powerful. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1896.56s)]
*  And on any given day, a number of these submarines [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1899.56s)]
*  are hiding somewhere in the world's oceans, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1902.56s)]
*  ready to respond to a launch order from the President. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1905.56s)]
*  When you're out here, are other countries looking for you? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1908.56s)]
*  I always operate on that assumption that someone's looking for me. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1911.56s)]
*  Has anybody ever found you? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1914.56s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1916.6s)]
*  60 Minutes found the Kentucky, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1918.6s)]
*  but only because we had arranged a rendezvous to go aboard. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1920.6s)]
*  If this boat were a country, you'd be a nuclear power. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1923.6s)]
*  That's true, yes, sir. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1926.6s)]
*  Does that ever give you pause [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1929.6s)]
*  to have all that power under your command? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1932.6s)]
*  It's a lot of responsibility, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1935.6s)]
*  but with that responsibility comes [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1938.6s)]
*  a lot of training and practice. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1941.6s)]
*  Die! Die! [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1945.6399999999999s)]
*  All been cycled, all been shut. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1949.6399999999999s)]
*  Operating at a depth of 160 feet, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1951.6399999999999s)]
*  the Kentucky's crew practiced the procedures needed to launch its missiles. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1954.6399999999999s)]
*  Set condition 1SQ for training. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1958.6399999999999s)]
*  This is the captain. This is an exercise. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1960.6399999999999s)]
*  Set condition 1SQ for training. Convo weapons at. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1962.6399999999999s)]
*  Span up all missiles. Chief of the watch, sound the general alarm. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1965.6399999999999s)]
*  General alarm, sir. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1968.6399999999999s)]
*  I have permission to fire. Convo weapons at. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1970.6399999999999s)]
*  Before that trigger can be squeezed, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1972.68s)]
*  multiple keys, including one that unlocks the missile tubes, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1974.68s)]
*  which take up approximately one-third of the ship, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1977.68s)]
*  have to be brought out from different safes. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1980.68s)]
*  No one person can make a launch happen. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1983.68s)]
*  So I have keys in my possession. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1985.68s)]
*  Other members of the crew have keys in their possession. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1987.68s)]
*  One key is carried to the captain by two sailors, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1990.68s)]
*  who both must hold it. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1993.68s)]
*  Captain, the launch is authorized. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1995.68s)]
*  And here's the thing you need to know about the safe where that key is kept. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=1997.68s)]
*  No one on board has the combination. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2000.72s)]
*  We get that combination with the launch order. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2002.72s)]
*  That is my way of knowing that the president has ordered the launch [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2004.72s)]
*  is when the combination he gives me opens that safe. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2008.72s)]
*  The president literally gives you the combination to the safe that the key is in? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2011.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2016.72s)]
*  You have permission to fire. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2017.72s)]
*  Two weapons, you have permission to fire, aye, sir. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2018.72s)]
*  Weapons con, you have permission to fire. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2020.72s)]
*  The Kentucky and other nuclear missile submarines, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2024.72s)]
*  along with intercontinental ballistic missiles, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2027.72s)]
*  and nuclear bombers, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2029.76s)]
*  Attention on deck. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2031.76s)]
*  are under the command of Admiral Cecil Haney. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2032.76s)]
*  Your nuclear forces are capable of executing all assigned missions. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2034.76s)]
*  Head of the U.S. Strategic Command, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2037.76s)]
*  Haney is the most powerful military officer you've never heard of, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2039.76s)]
*  in command not just of the nation's nuclear forces, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2043.76s)]
*  but its space satellites and cyber weapons as well. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2046.76s)]
*  There are no significant solar activity [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2049.76s)]
*  causing impacts to satellite operations or communications. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2052.76s)]
*  His morning briefing at Strategic Command headquarters [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2055.76s)]
*  in Omaha, Nebraska, is classified above top secret. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2058.8s)]
*  Thank you, I appreciate the update. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2061.8s)]
*  That clock marked POTUS, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2063.8s)]
*  short for President of the United States, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2065.8s)]
*  tells Haney what time zone President Obama is in [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2067.8s)]
*  in case he has to reach the commander in chief in a hurry. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2071.8s)]
*  So who in the United States government has the authority [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2074.8s)]
*  to order the use of nuclear weapons? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2078.8s)]
*  Only the president of the United States has that authority. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2080.8s)]
*  Does Congress have to approve? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2084.8s)]
*  No, Congress does not have to approve. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2086.84s)]
*  So these really are the president's own weapons? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2088.84s)]
*  It's our nation's weapons with the president's authority, yes. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2092.84s)]
*  Attention on deck! [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2095.84s)]
*  Haney took us to his global operations center, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2097.84s)]
*  a top secret facility three stories underground. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2099.84s)]
*  If a missile were launched against the United States, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2102.84s)]
*  the warning would be received here, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2105.84s)]
*  and that clock would start ticking down. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2107.84s)]
*  Colonel Barbara Buells was the watch commander. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2110.84s)]
*  I see this sign up here, red impact, blue impact time, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2113.88s)]
*  so red impact would be an enemy missile? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2116.88s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2119.88s)]
*  And you would have a time? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2120.88s)]
*  We would have a time to impact. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2121.88s)]
*  And blue impact would be any U.S. counterattack. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2123.88s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Gielin would pull out the options [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2128.88s)]
*  for a retaliatory nuclear strike. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2131.88s)]
*  My responsibility as the strike comm nuclear strike advisor [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2133.88s)]
*  is to be the expert on nuclear decision handbook [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2136.88s)]
*  and the alert status of all nuclear systems [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2139.88s)]
*  and the alert status of all U.S. nuclear forces. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2142.92s)]
*  The nuclear decision handbook. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2144.92s)]
*  You also know it's the black book. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2146.92s)]
*  Black book. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2147.92s)]
*  So is there a copy of the black book down here? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2148.92s)]
*  There is, it's in the safe down here, sir. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2150.92s)]
*  An identical copy of the black book is in that briefcase [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2152.92s)]
*  which follows the president wherever he goes. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2156.92s)]
*  So he's never away from the options? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2159.92s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2162.92s)]
*  And would they tell him what kinds of weapons you would use, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2163.92s)]
*  what targets you would hit? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2168.92s)]
*  They would be that specific, yes. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2169.92s)]
*  Would they give him an estimate of casualties? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2171.96s)]
*  Yeah, we would have to give the president answers [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2175.96s)]
*  to a lot of different questions. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2178.96s)]
*  That's one that I would expect to get. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2180.96s)]
*  Ad Mojaney would go to a room called the battle deck [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2183.96s)]
*  where he would talk directly to the president. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2186.96s)]
*  And is this the phone you would use? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2188.96s)]
*  This is one of the phones I might use, yes. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2191.96s)]
*  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of Defense, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2194.96s)]
*  I don't see the man who controls... [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2199.0s)]
*  You're looking for the president. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2201.0s)]
*  I am. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2203.0s)]
*  I can speak to the president directly from this microphone. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2204.0s)]
*  And in a crisis, how long does it take [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2207.0s)]
*  to get the president on the line? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2209.0s)]
*  Not very long. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2211.0s)]
*  If Russia launched a missile from a submarine [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2212.0s)]
*  off the coast of the United States, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2215.0s)]
*  it would take only minutes to reach its target. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2217.0s)]
*  So how long, in fact, does the president have [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2219.0s)]
*  to make a decision? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2223.0s)]
*  He has minutes, seven, eight, nine, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2224.0s)]
*  depending on details, but less than ten minutes. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2227.04s)]
*  Former Secretary of Defense William Perry [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2230.04s)]
*  was a key architect of nuclear weapons [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2232.04s)]
*  during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2235.04s)]
*  If the weapons can be launched within minutes, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2237.04s)]
*  does that mean we're still in the same old hair-trigger standoff [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2241.04s)]
*  that we were during the Cold War? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2246.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2248.04s)]
*  And we still have launch on warning, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2249.04s)]
*  the same policy we had then, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2251.04s)]
*  we still have the same hair-trigger response. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2252.04s)]
*  So what's changed since the Cold War [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2254.08s)]
*  if we're still on this hair-trigger alert? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2256.08s)]
*  Fundamentally, nothing has changed. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2259.08s)]
*  But the numbers of weapons are much lower now [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2261.08s)]
*  than during the Cold War? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2265.08s)]
*  The number of weapons are sufficient to destroy, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2266.08s)]
*  obliterate all of civilization. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2269.08s)]
*  Still? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2271.08s)]
*  Still. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2272.08s)]
*  It doesn't take that many. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2273.08s)]
*  We still have more than 1,000 nuclear weapons [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2275.08s)]
*  on alert, ready to go. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2280.08s)]
*  It doesn't take 1,000 to destroy civilization. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2282.12s)]
*  At the end of the Cold War, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2285.12s)]
*  both sides pledged to point their missiles at the open ocean. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2287.12s)]
*  But it would take just minutes to change back to real targets. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2290.12s)]
*  That provides a small hedge against an accidental war [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2294.12s)]
*  triggered by a false alarm [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2297.12s)]
*  of the kind Perry experienced in 1979 [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2299.12s)]
*  when a watch officer mistakenly inserted a training tape [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2302.12s)]
*  into a computer. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2305.12s)]
*  So it looked like 200 ICBMs were in the air. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2307.12s)]
*  So it looked like 200 ICBMs were on the way [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2310.16s)]
*  from the Soviet Union to the United States. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2313.16s)]
*  Happily, we got that situation figured out [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2316.16s)]
*  before we had to go to the President. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2318.16s)]
*  But had we not, he would have received a call [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2320.16s)]
*  at 3 o'clock in the morning and said, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2322.16s)]
*  sir, you have 7 or 8 minutes to decide [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2324.16s)]
*  what is the launch this before these missiles land [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2326.16s)]
*  on our ICBM silos. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2328.16s)]
*  And what was the failsafe there? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2330.16s)]
*  What stopped it from going to the President? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2332.16s)]
*  What stopped it was a stooped general [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2335.2s)]
*  who sensed something was wrong. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2341.2s)]
*  If you've had one serious case in 45 years, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2344.2s)]
*  that would seem like a pretty good record. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2349.2s)]
*  Yeah, it only takes one. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2352.2s)]
*  It only takes one. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2355.2s)]
*  Strategic Command is building [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2358.2s)]
*  a new $1.2 billion headquarters, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2360.2s)]
*  but it won't be any more able to survive [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2363.24s)]
*  a nuclear blast than the underground command center [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2365.24s)]
*  in the current headquarters. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2368.24s)]
*  That clock counting down the time to missile impact [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2370.24s)]
*  would also tell Admiral Haney how long he had [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2373.24s)]
*  to get out of there alive. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2376.24s)]
*  Safe escape time that you see indicated [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2378.24s)]
*  is the time left remaining for Admiral Haney [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2381.24s)]
*  as the commander of US.com to exit the battle deck [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2385.24s)]
*  to be able to make it to his commander support aircraft [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2389.24s)]
*  to be able to board that aircraft [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2392.2799999999997s)]
*  and continue to provide his advice [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2394.2799999999997s)]
*  to the President of the United States [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2397.2799999999997s)]
*  as his senior nuclear advisor. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2399.2799999999997s)]
*  On the tarmac at STRATCOM, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2403.2799999999997s)]
*  air crews drill to take off from this airborne command post [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2405.2799999999997s)]
*  fast enough to escape incoming nuclear weapons. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2408.2799999999997s)]
*  If Admiral Haney's headquarters were destroyed [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2412.2799999999997s)]
*  and he didn't make it out in time, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2414.2799999999997s)]
*  it would be up to Rear Admiral Andy Lennon [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2417.2799999999997s)]
*  to assume command [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2419.2799999999997s)]
*  and make sure the President and only the President [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2421.32s)]
*  could still give the order to launch nuclear weapons. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2424.32s)]
*  We're in voice communications with the President. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2427.32s)]
*  Talking to the President personally? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2429.32s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2431.32s)]
*  So that way we are ensuring [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2432.32s)]
*  that we're getting the President's intent. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2433.32s)]
*  How do you know it's the President? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2435.32s)]
*  We have some very complex and secure procedures [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2437.32s)]
*  to authenticate the President [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2440.32s)]
*  and to be sure that we're really talking [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2442.32s)]
*  to the President of the United States. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2444.32s)]
*  So he can't just tell you this is the President speaking? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2446.32s)]
*  He can, but we will authenticate [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2450.36s)]
*  to verify that it is the President speaking. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2452.36s)]
*  Once the President has given you that order, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2454.36s)]
*  what do you do? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2457.36s)]
*  Then we would communicate that order [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2459.36s)]
*  to our strategic forces, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2461.36s)]
*  our intercontinental ballistic missiles, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2462.36s)]
*  our bombers or our submarines. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2464.36s)]
*  Chief of Arms, down the general alarm. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2466.36s)]
*  Sail the general alarm, I serve. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2468.36s)]
*  The order would be received onboard the Kentucky [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2470.36s)]
*  and the crew would go through launch procedures [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2472.36s)]
*  they have practiced hundreds of times before. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2474.36s)]
*  Last year, the Kentucky actually fired [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2476.4s)]
*  an unarmed missile in a test flight [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2478.4s)]
*  which lit up the California sky [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2480.4s)]
*  and caused a brief UFO scare. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2482.4s)]
*  Had it carried a real warhead... [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2485.4s)]
*  This is our meteorological effects officer. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2487.4s)]
*  Stuart Miller, a young Air Force captain [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2489.4s)]
*  aboard the Airborne Command Post [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2491.4s)]
*  would begin charting the unthinkable. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2493.4s)]
*  My main role is gathering information [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2495.4s)]
*  on nuclear detonations worldwide [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2498.4s)]
*  and then applying meteorological data to them, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2500.4s)]
*  especially the ones that are in the air [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2503.4s)]
*  and then applying it to them, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2505.44s)]
*  specifically winds to figure out [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2507.44s)]
*  if there's fallout, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2509.44s)]
*  depending on the attributes of the detonation [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2511.44s)]
*  where the fallout's going, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2513.44s)]
*  how many people might be affected, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2515.44s)]
*  who might be affected, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2517.44s)]
*  things of that nature. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2519.44s)]
*  So you basically come up with a casualty estimate of... [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2521.44s)]
*  Essentially, yes. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2525.44s)]
*  That's one of the things that I can provide. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2527.44s)]
*  You must have looked at some pretty depressing scenarios. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2529.44s)]
*  We kind of do, yeah. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2532.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2534.48s)]
*  Have you ever had the conversation with yourself, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2538.48s)]
*  well, what if the president issued an order [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2541.48s)]
*  to use nuclear weapons and I didn't agree with it? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2543.48s)]
*  Who would I carry out that order? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2547.48s)]
*  The president expects me, as his combatant commander, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2549.48s)]
*  to provide him the best military advice I have. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2552.48s)]
*  So he would expect me to voice my opinion. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2556.48s)]
*  You would get... You would have a voice, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2560.48s)]
*  but if you disagreed with the decision... [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2562.52s)]
*  I'm a military man, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2565.52s)]
*  and we follow the orders of our commander-in-chief. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2567.52s)]
*  NATO, which just marked its 70th anniversary, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2578.52s)]
*  is widely considered the gold standard [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2581.52s)]
*  of military alliances, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2583.52s)]
*  binding countries on both sides of the Atlantic [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2585.52s)]
*  in common cause against Russian aggression. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2588.52s)]
*  The president Trump complains that other members [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2591.56s)]
*  of the alliance don't pay their fair share [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2593.56s)]
*  of what it costs to defend Europe [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2595.56s)]
*  against the intimidation tactics of Vladimir Putin. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2597.56s)]
*  The president has told A's he doesn't see [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2601.56s)]
*  the point of the alliance, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2603.56s)]
*  and has even mentioned withdrawing from NATO. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2605.56s)]
*  Despite those misgivings, the US and its NATO allies [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2608.56s)]
*  have been steadily increasing the frequency [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2611.56s)]
*  and size of their military exercises. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2613.56s)]
*  Last fall, NATO held the largest one yet, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2616.56s)]
*  in Norway, one of the countries [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2619.6s)]
*  President Trump has singled out [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2621.6s)]
*  for failing to spend enough on defense. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2623.6s)]
*  You might not think of Norway, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2626.6s)]
*  which has a tiny military, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2628.6s)]
*  as a vital NATO ally, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2630.6s)]
*  but we found a country that is on the front lines [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2632.6s)]
*  with Russia and serves as NATO's eyes and ears [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2634.6s)]
*  in the high north. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2638.6s)]
*  Norway's F-16s are on 15-minute alert 24-7. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2642.6s)]
*  Every time Russian military aircraft [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2646.6s)]
*  are detected, these pilots scramble to intercept them. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2648.64s)]
*  Videos they bring back show nuclear-capable [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2654.64s)]
*  Russian bombers as they fly up and down [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2657.64s)]
*  the Norwegian coast. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2660.64s)]
*  Most of the encounters are routine. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2662.64s)]
*  But sometimes, says Lieutenant General Rune Jakobsen, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2666.64s)]
*  Norway's Joint Force Commander, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2669.64s)]
*  they're anything but. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2671.64s)]
*  What we have seen lately is aggressive, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2673.64s)]
*  flying and simulated attacks against [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2677.68s)]
*  Norwegian exercises. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2684.68s)]
*  Simulated attacks? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2687.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2689.68s)]
*  How do you know it's a simulated attack? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2690.68s)]
*  An airman knows what an attack looks like. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2692.68s)]
*  So they go to the point at which [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2695.68s)]
*  they would release their weapons? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2697.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2699.68s)]
*  Jakobsen tracked those simulated attacks [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2700.68s)]
*  from his command center buried deep inside a mountain. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2703.68s)]
*  After the Cold War ended, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2706.72s)]
*  a nuclear-proof bunker seemed positively old-fashioned [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2708.72s)]
*  until lately when Russia became more threatening. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2711.72s)]
*  This is an illustration of a Russian attack formation, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2715.72s)]
*  simulated attack, that was flown in May 2017 [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2720.72s)]
*  not far north of this position. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2725.72s)]
*  And the red dot is the target? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2728.72s)]
*  The red dot is the target. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2730.72s)]
*  That doesn't look like the act of a friendly country. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2732.72s)]
*  No, that's not something you should do to your neighbor. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2735.7599999999998s)]
*  Norway shares a 120-mile border with its neighbor Russia. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2740.7599999999998s)]
*  It is some of the most remote, rugged [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2744.7599999999998s)]
*  and beautiful landscape in all of Europe. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2746.7599999999998s)]
*  Captain Carina Vinterdahl guards the northern sector [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2750.7599999999998s)]
*  with 120 soldiers. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2753.7599999999998s)]
*  They are along the border all the time, 24-7. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2755.7599999999998s)]
*  I have people along the border. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2758.7599999999998s)]
*  So I have four observation posts [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2760.7599999999998s)]
*  that are manned at all times throughout the whole year. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2763.8s)]
*  Are your soldiers armed? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2767.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2768.8s)]
*  Do they ever have to use their weapons? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2769.8s)]
*  No, but we have to be prepared. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2771.8s)]
*  We went to the most remote of those outposts [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2775.8s)]
*  in the high north of the Norwegian mainland. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2777.8s)]
*  One unit was just finishing its three weeks on watch [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2780.8s)]
*  and a new one coming in. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2783.8s)]
*  To get there, you have to lug your gear [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2786.8s)]
*  up a long, steep staircase, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2788.8s)]
*  part of which is covered over [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2790.84s)]
*  to defend against the Arctic winter. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2792.84s)]
*  The observation post is manned year-round [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2795.84s)]
*  and once you get to the top, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2798.84s)]
*  you can see why it's worth the trouble. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2800.84s)]
*  These Norwegian soldiers are able to look deep into Russia [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2802.84s)]
*  and far out to sea, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2805.84s)]
*  making this a key piece of terrain for the NATO alliance. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2807.84s)]
*  That's Russia over there [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2812.84s)]
*  and this is where the border with Norway ends. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2814.84s)]
*  It's NATO's northernmost flank [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2816.84s)]
*  and you don't need to be a military expert [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2818.88s)]
*  to know you can never leave your flank exposed. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2820.88s)]
*  That includes the Barents Sea out there. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2823.88s)]
*  Those are the home operating waters [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2826.88s)]
*  of Russia's northern fleet [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2828.88s)]
*  and are kept under constant surveillance [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2830.88s)]
*  by the US and Norway. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2832.88s)]
*  This map shows what lies just over the horizon [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2835.88s)]
*  on that thumb of land called the Kola Peninsula. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2838.88s)]
*  It is the home of Russia's northern fleet. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2841.88s)]
*  Naval bases, airfields and nuclear weapons storage sites [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2844.88s)]
*  which represent that country's single greatest concentration [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2847.92s)]
*  of military power, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2850.92s)]
*  especially submarines. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2852.92s)]
*  They have a very capable submarine force [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2855.92s)]
*  and we've seen an increase in submarine activity [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2857.92s)]
*  over the last few years that causes me pause. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2860.92s)]
*  Admiral James Fogle, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2864.92s)]
*  the commander of US naval forces in Europe, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2865.92s)]
*  is particularly concerned about this submarine, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2868.92s)]
*  the Severodvinsk. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2871.92s)]
*  Nuclear powered and armed with land attack cruise missiles [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2873.92s)]
*  with a range greater than 1,000 miles. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2876.96s)]
*  The Severodvinsk is a brand new class of submarine [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2879.96s)]
*  and it's very capable, it's very quiet. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2882.96s)]
*  So that's the most important thing [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2885.96s)]
*  I think in submarine warfare. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2888.96s)]
*  When you say quiet, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2890.96s)]
*  you're saying harder to detect, harder to track. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2891.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2894.96s)]
*  Does that sub come down into the Atlantic? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2896.96s)]
*  Suffice it to say that the Russians have increased [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2899.96s)]
*  their presence in all bodies of water around Europe [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2903.0s)]
*  and in the Atlantic. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2907.0s)]
*  Have you ever lost the Severodvinsk? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2909.0s)]
*  I'd rather not comment on submarine operations [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2912.0s)]
*  to that specific level of detail. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2915.0s)]
*  Fogle won't comment, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2918.0s)]
*  but Pentagon officials told 60 Minutes [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2919.0s)]
*  that last summer the Severodvinsk slipped into the Atlantic Ocean [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2921.0s)]
*  and for weeks evaded all attempts to find it. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2925.0s)]
*  In peacetime, losing a Russian sub in the Atlantic [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2929.0s)]
*  is embarrassing. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2932.04s)]
*  In a crisis, it could be a disaster. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2933.04s)]
*  Think about the global infrastructure [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2936.04s)]
*  that rests on the bottom of the ocean. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2939.04s)]
*  You're talking about the undersea cables? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2941.04s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2943.04s)]
*  Those fiber optic cables carry 99.4% of the data [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2945.04s)]
*  exchanged over the Internet [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2949.04s)]
*  by the US and its allies and trading partners. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2951.04s)]
*  Depending on your point of view, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2954.04s)]
*  they are either the backbone [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2956.04s)]
*  or the Achilles heel of the world economy. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2958.04s)]
*  Have Russian submarines gotten close to those undersea cables? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2961.08s)]
*  I'm not at liberty to talk about any of that. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2966.08s)]
*  That's because tracking Russian submarines [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2969.08s)]
*  is a top-secret, day-in, day-out game of hide and seek. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2971.08s)]
*  But the Norwegian military allowed 60 Minutes [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2976.08s)]
*  aboard one of its maritime patrol planes [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2979.08s)]
*  to see what sub-hunting looks like. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2981.08s)]
*  The pilot, co-pilot and engineer are up front, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2984.08s)]
*  while the crew in the back scans the road [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2987.08s)]
*  while the crew in the back scans the Norwegian sea [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2989.12s)]
*  with radar and high-powered cameras. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2992.12s)]
*  Flying at less than 300 feet, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2994.12s)]
*  they can clearly make out anything on the surface, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2996.12s)]
*  including passing cargo ships. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=2999.12s)]
*  For what's under the water, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3001.12s)]
*  they drop patterns of sonobuys [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3003.12s)]
*  which send out sound waves [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3005.12s)]
*  that will bounce off a submerged submarine. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3007.12s)]
*  Major Leif Otterholm, the plane's tactical coordinator, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3012.12s)]
*  has been flying these missions since the 1980s. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3015.12s)]
*  It is very important to collect on remote locations. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3018.16s)]
*  How big an area is it that you have to cover? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3021.16s)]
*  The area of operation for this kind of aircraft [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3024.16s)]
*  is six times larger than the area of land in Norway, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3027.16s)]
*  so it's quite big. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3031.16s)]
*  So how frequently do you encounter the Russians out here? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3034.16s)]
*  We encounter them regularly when we go further east. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3038.16s)]
*  Further east lies the headquarters of the Northern Fleet. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3042.16s)]
*  The Norwegian patrol planes frequently spot Russian submarines [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3045.2s)]
*  while they're still on the surface. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3048.2s)]
*  But the most valuable intelligence is collected by a ship, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3050.2s)]
*  one you've never heard of. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3054.2s)]
*  There it is, down there in the harbor, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3056.2s)]
*  the crown jewel of Norway's fleet. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3058.2s)]
*  That's Norway's newest spy ship, the Marjada. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3061.2s)]
*  It's at sea nearly 300 days a year [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3064.2s)]
*  monitoring the Northern Fleet, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3067.2s)]
*  but just happened to be in port [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3069.2s)]
*  the day we arrived here in Kyrkenes, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3071.2s)]
*  the town closest to the Russian border. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3073.24s)]
*  The Marjada flies the Norwegian flag, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3075.24s)]
*  but much of its eavesdropping equipment comes from the U.S. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3078.24s)]
*  Its mission is to collect intelligence [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3082.24s)]
*  on the operations of Russia's Northern Fleet, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3084.24s)]
*  which Lieutenant General Jakobsen says is arming itself [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3090.24s)]
*  with a new generation of precision-guided weapons [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3093.24s)]
*  and testing them in the waters off Norway. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3096.24s)]
*  Are you able to monitor those? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3099.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because most of the testing of new equipment [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3101.2799999999997s)]
*  is done up north of the Kola Peninsula, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3104.2799999999997s)]
*  and we are present there every day [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3107.2799999999997s)]
*  with our maritime patrol aircrafts and our vessels at sea. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3110.2799999999997s)]
*  That daily haul of intelligence, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3115.2799999999997s)]
*  all of which is directly relayed to the U.S. and NATO, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3117.2799999999997s)]
*  didn't stop President Trump [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3120.2799999999997s)]
*  from sending this letter of complaint. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3122.2799999999997s)]
*  Norway, he wrote, is the only NATO ally [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3125.32s)]
*  sharing a border with Russia [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3128.32s)]
*  that lacks a credible plan to spend [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3130.32s)]
*  2% of its gross domestic product on defense. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3132.32s)]
*  Well, I think that he has a fair point [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3135.32s)]
*  in pointing out that we need to step up. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3138.32s)]
*  Ina Eriksson-Saraita is Norway's foreign minister, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3141.32s)]
*  the first woman to hold the job. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3144.32s)]
*  So these are all your predecessors? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3146.32s)]
*  They are, they are. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3148.32s)]
*  And the Russian is the second largest. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3150.32s)]
*  So these are all your predecessors? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3152.36s)]
*  They are, they are. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3154.36s)]
*  And they're all men. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3156.36s)]
*  And they're all men. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3157.36s)]
*  You're the first woman. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3158.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3159.36s)]
*  Before that, she was defense minister [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3160.36s)]
*  in 2014, when all the members of NATO [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3162.36s)]
*  pledged to increase their military spending [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3165.36s)]
*  to 2% of their GDP. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3168.36s)]
*  So have you met that pledge? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3170.36s)]
*  No, we haven't met it yet, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3172.36s)]
*  but we are moving in the right direction [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3174.36s)]
*  and we are doing a lot of big investments. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3176.36s)]
*  The biggest of those investments [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3178.36s)]
*  is the state F-35, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3180.4s)]
*  a stealth fighter designed to evade [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3182.4s)]
*  state-of-the-art air defenses. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3184.4s)]
*  It will dramatically increase operational capabilities [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3186.4s)]
*  both in the high north and beyond. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3189.4s)]
*  Norway is buying 52 of them [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3192.4s)]
*  at a cost of $89 million each. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3194.4s)]
*  It's a very expensive airplane. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3197.4s)]
*  Well, and it also functions well, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3199.4s)]
*  and it has capabilities that we need. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3201.4s)]
*  Our F-16 has served us well, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3203.4s)]
*  but they are starting to get old. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3205.4s)]
*  Those F-16s are going on 40 years old [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3207.44s)]
*  and were never designed to be stealthy. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3210.44s)]
*  Until they are replaced by the F-35, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3212.44s)]
*  Lieutenant General Jartensen told us, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3215.44s)]
*  Norway's Air Force will be no match [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3217.44s)]
*  for Russia's modern air defenses. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3219.44s)]
*  Meaning today, if we had a conflict, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3221.44s)]
*  we would not be able to fly [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3226.44s)]
*  in the northernmost part of Norway. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3228.44s)]
*  So your Air Force today [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3231.44s)]
*  couldn't operate in the very high north? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3233.44s)]
*  No, not in a serious crisis. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3236.48s)]
*  Last fall, NATO practiced what it would do [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3241.48s)]
*  in a serious crisis, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3244.48s)]
*  bringing in 50,000 troops, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3246.48s)]
*  250 aircraft, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3251.48s)]
*  and 65 ships all under the command of Admiral Fogo. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3254.48s)]
*  This is one of the largest NATO exercises [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3258.48s)]
*  since the Cold War. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3261.48s)]
*  Called Trident Juncture, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3263.48s)]
*  it was a war game designed to repulse [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3265.52s)]
*  an invasion of Norway by an unnamed country [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3267.52s)]
*  whose identity was a mystery to no one. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3270.52s)]
*  And the message to Russia is? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3274.52s)]
*  The message to Russia or anybody else [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3276.52s)]
*  that may want to challenge the alliances, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3278.52s)]
*  think twice. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3280.52s)]
*  You don't want to mess with us. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3281.52s)]
*  It was the first time in nearly 30 years [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3283.52s)]
*  the U.S. had sent a carrier strike group, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3285.52s)]
*  the USS Harry S. Truman and his escorts, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3287.52s)]
*  above the Arctic Circle. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3290.52s)]
*  A long way from the Persian Gulf [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3292.52s)]
*  and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3294.56s)]
*  Did you feel that NATO [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3297.56s)]
*  just wasn't paying attention to Norway? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3299.56s)]
*  What we saw was that NATO over many years [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3303.56s)]
*  had been engaged heavily, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3305.56s)]
*  for instance, in Afghanistan, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3307.56s)]
*  and that's a very important mission. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3309.56s)]
*  But we also saw that some of the, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3311.56s)]
*  I would say, core areas of NATO, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3313.56s)]
*  the territorial defense, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3316.56s)]
*  maybe had not had the same attention over years. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3318.56s)]
*  Well, now you have an American aircraft carrier [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3321.6s)]
*  operating off your coast. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3323.6s)]
*  I think it is a very good way of showing [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3325.6s)]
*  that we have to practice in peacetime [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3328.6s)]
*  to be able to operate if the crisis occurs. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3330.6s)]
*  Norway will never have a military [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3333.6s)]
*  that can take on its much larger [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3335.6s)]

*  But the pilots who fly these F-16s [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3340.6s)]
*  call themselves the Guardians of the North. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3342.6s)]
*  They can't stop the Russians, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3346.6s)]
*  but they are the first to see [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3348.6s)]
*  and are the first to spot them. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3350.64s)]
*  The sea ice over the Arctic [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3360.64s)]
*  is melting and shrinking so fast, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3362.64s)]
*  we will see in our lifetime [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3364.64s)]
*  something that hasn't happened, it's believed, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3366.64s)]
*  since the end of the last Ice Age, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3368.64s)]
*  the opening of an ocean, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3371.64s)]
*  the Arctic Ocean. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3373.64s)]
*  And with that, access to trade routes [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3375.64s)]
*  and trillions of dollars worth of oil [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3377.64s)]
*  and natural gas almost as much [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3379.68s)]
*  as the entire U.S. economy. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3381.68s)]
*  But this isn't a story about climate change. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3384.68s)]
*  This is a story about the competition [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3387.68s)]
*  for those riches. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3389.68s)]
*  The Russians, for instance, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3391.68s)]
*  have already amassed a major military [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3392.68s)]
*  presence in the region. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3394.68s)]
*  It's also about pioneers, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3397.68s)]
*  U.S. scientists and naval personnel [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3399.68s)]
*  learning to tough it out [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3402.68s)]
*  in the harshness of this still [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3404.68s)]
*  ice-covered frontier. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3406.68s)]
*  We discovered just how harsh [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3408.72s)]
*  on a recent trip to the Arctic. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3410.72s)]
*  The Arctic Ocean sits on top of the globe [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3413.72s)]
*  encircled by Russia, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3416.72s)]

*  Norway, Greenland, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3421.72s)]
*  Canada, and the United States [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3423.72s)]
*  thanks to Alaska. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3426.72s)]
*  We flew, as guests of the Navy, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3429.72s)]
*  from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3431.72s)]

*  to a spot where the ice was still [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3438.7599999999998s)]
*  thick enough to support this base camp. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3440.7599999999998s)]
*  It was a small, temporary village [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3443.7599999999998s)]
*  disrupting the peace and purity of the ice [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3445.7599999999998s)]
*  white as far as the eye can see. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3448.7599999999998s)]
*  The camp was built for a scientific [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3452.7599999999998s)]
*  and military exercise [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3454.7599999999998s)]
*  called ICEX 2016. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3456.7599999999998s)]
*  Hi everyone. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3460.7599999999998s)]
*  How do you do? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3461.7599999999998s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3462.7599999999998s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3463.7599999999998s)]
*  For five weeks, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3464.8s)]
*  this no-man's-land of ice [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3465.8s)]
*  was home to an expeditionary team [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3467.8s)]
*  of sailors, scientists, and engineers [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3470.8s)]
*  whose mission was to understand how to survive [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3473.8s)]
*  in maybe the most hostile conditions on Earth. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3476.8s)]
*  The Navy says those taking part in this exercise [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3480.8s)]
*  are the first humans ever to set foot [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3483.8s)]
*  on this part of the planet. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3485.8s)]
*  It's actually beautiful beyond belief, isn't it? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3487.8s)]
*  It really is. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3489.8s)]
*  Chuck Maguire was one of the first to arrive. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3490.8s)]
*  He's an engineer with the University of Washington's [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3493.84s)]
*  Applied Physics Lab [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3496.84s)]
*  that was brought in to build this camp from scratch. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3498.84s)]
*  So you get off the plane, there's nothing. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3502.84s)]
*  There's no shelter, there's no indoors. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3504.84s)]
*  There was just ice. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3507.84s)]
*  Ice everywhere. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3508.84s)]
*  That's right. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3509.84s)]
*  And you say, how am I going to survive? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3510.84s)]
*  You pick up a hammer and start building. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3512.84s)]
*  They built a makeshift city called Sargo [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3515.84s)]
*  for roughly 60 people [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3518.84s)]
*  consisting of a command post [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3520.84s)]
*  tight living quarters [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3522.88s)]
*  a mess hall stocked with food air lifted in weekly [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3524.88s)]
*  and some very primitive toilet facilities. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3528.88s)]
*  That outhouse is really cold. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3532.88s)]
*  Outhouse is awful. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3534.88s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3535.88s)]
*  What about water? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3536.88s)]
*  You can't just eat the ice, right? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3537.88s)]
*  You can if you know what you're looking for. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3539.88s)]
*  This ice mining team knows what to look for. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3543.88s)]
*  Old sea ice [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3546.88s)]
*  that's been baking in the sun long enough [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3547.88s)]
*  that the salt has leached out. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3550.92s)]
*  Ice mining team, ice mining team, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3552.92s)]
*  we are returning back to camp. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3554.92s)]
*  They bring back chunks to melt down [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3557.92s)]
*  into the camp's only drinking water. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3559.92s)]
*  All the things that you take for granted [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3562.92s)]
*  in normal civilization, right? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3565.92s)]
*  Shelter, food, the ease of going to the bathroom, right? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3567.92s)]
*  That is all different out here. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3571.92s)]
*  What qualities do you think it takes [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3573.92s)]
*  to stay here and survive out here? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3576.92s)]
*  For weeks? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3579.96s)]
*  I think maybe you have to be a little off initially [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3580.96s)]
*  and really understand [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3584.96s)]
*  that everything outside that door [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3586.96s)]
*  is trying to kill you here. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3588.96s)]
*  If the ice and wind don't get you, polar bears might. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3591.96s)]
*  An armed sentry patrols the perimeter of the camp [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3595.96s)]
*  in case one comes looking for food. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3598.96s)]
*  Good evening everyone. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3600.96s)]
*  Another successful day here at Sargo. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3602.96s)]
*  There's a daily briefing in the command post [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3604.96s)]
*  to coordinate the various researchers [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3607.0s)]
*  who are studying and trying to understand [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3609.0s)]
*  this part of the world [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3612.0s)]
*  as they plan for a more sustained presence here. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3613.0s)]
*  They're analyzing, among other things, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3617.0s)]
*  the ice has moved about nine miles [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3619.0s)]
*  to the west-northwest today. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3621.0s)]
*  how climate change is affecting the way the ice here [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3623.0s)]
*  drifts and migrates. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3626.0s)]
*  It feels like you're on land. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3628.0s)]
*  You get the sense that you're on land. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3630.0s)]
*  It's very firm and the plane could land. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3632.0s)]
*  But we're moving, which is kind of astonishing. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3635.04s)]
*  I think every day it's interesting to wake up [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3638.04s)]
*  and recognize your eight or nine miles [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3641.04s)]
*  from where you were the day before. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3643.04s)]
*  It looks the same, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3645.04s)]
*  but it's pretty interesting to figure that out. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3646.04s)]
*  The ice moves that much every day [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3649.04s)]
*  in unpredictable directions [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3652.04s)]
*  because of the currents under water [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3654.04s)]
*  and the wind above. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3656.04s)]
*  Down here we're 23 degrees Celsius. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3658.04s)]
*  Also unpredictable is the weather. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3661.04s)]
*  We met a team of meteorologists [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3664.08s)]
*  using balloons to help with forecasting, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3666.08s)]
*  which is key for any military operation. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3669.08s)]
*  These balloons measure your temperature, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3672.08s)]
*  your dew point, the wind speed. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3674.08s)]
*  Commander Scott Parker, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3676.08s)]
*  a meteorologist with the Navy's Atlantic Submarine Force, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3678.08s)]
*  says there's virtually no weather data collected up here. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3682.08s)]
*  In other parts of the world, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3685.08s)]
*  meteorologists rely on satellites for forecasting. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3687.08s)]
*  But up here near the North Pole, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3691.08s)]
*  satellite coverage is minimal. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3693.12s)]
*  How cold does it get up here? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3695.12s)]
*  Because it's right now, I don't know. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3697.12s)]
*  It's freezing, right? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3699.12s)]
*  The lowest we've had is 26 below Fahrenheit. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3701.12s)]
*  And today is actually our warmest day. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3705.12s)]
*  And right now it's 6 below. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3707.12s)]
*  And with this wind chill factor, [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3709.12s)]
*  because the wind is really blowing. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3711.12s)]
*  It is terrible. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3713.12s)]
*  It's about 25 below zero with the wind chill. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3714.12s)]
*  And you're telling me this is the warmest day you've had? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3716.12s)]
*  This is the warmest day we've had so far. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3719.12s)]
*  Do you want to go inside? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3721.12s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3722.16s)]
*  The temperature can drop to as low as 50 below. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3723.16s)]
*  And that can wreak havoc on just about everything. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3727.16s)]
*  Weapons, communication systems, sensors, and people, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3730.16s)]
*  including these Navy divers [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3736.16s)]
*  who were here to test their latest cold weather gear [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3738.16s)]
*  and their endurance in the frigid water. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3741.16s)]
*  These robotics engineers are conducting underwater experiments [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3744.16s)]
*  in a temperature-controlled tent. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3749.16s)]
*  When we were there, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3751.2s)]
*  Doug Horner and his team were field testing [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3752.2s)]
*  these underwater drones for the first time in the Arctic. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3755.2s)]
*  When we first put it in, we checked the ballast. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3759.2s)]
*  The drones are collecting scientific data about the Arctic [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3762.2s)]
*  where the water gets warmer the deeper you go. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3766.2s)]
*  They're also getting a picture of what it looks like down below. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3769.2s)]
*  My primary emphasis here is the ability to map the under ice. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3773.2s)]
*  We have sensors, sonar specifically, which is sound, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3779.24s)]
*  which is focused upwards. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3782.24s)]
*  What we hope to do with continually putting sound upwards [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3785.24s)]
*  is to make a map. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3789.24s)]
*  You're mapping the bottom of the ice? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3791.24s)]
*  Yes, the underneath portion of the ice. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3794.24s)]
*  Why is that important? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3796.24s)]
*  I want to be able to navigate relative to that. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3798.24s)]
*  This is the idea of being able to navigate [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3800.24s)]
*  an underwater robot accurately without GPS. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3803.24s)]
*  Because in the ice, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3806.2799999999997s)]
*  you don't have the opportunity to come up to the surface [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3807.2799999999997s)]
*  for a GPS fix. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3809.2799999999997s)]
*  He says these drones could also be used [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3810.2799999999997s)]
*  to patrol the waters of the Arctic [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3813.2799999999997s)]
*  looking for enemy subs, for instance, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3815.2799999999997s)]
*  the way drones hover in the sky over a battlefield. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3818.2799999999997s)]
*  The Navy is testing this technology [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3821.2799999999997s)]
*  and amassing all of this research [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3824.2799999999997s)]
*  to prepare for an expanded presence in the Arctic [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3826.2799999999997s)]
*  as the ice continues to melt. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3829.2799999999997s)]
*  The Russians are already there in force. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3832.2799999999997s)]
*  Last year, they staged a military exercise in the Arctic [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3835.32s)]
*  as seen in this Russian Ministry of Defense footage. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3838.32s)]
*  It involved about 40,000 troops, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3842.32s)]
*  15 submarines, 41 warships, and multiple aircraft. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3845.32s)]
*  No one disputes their right to do that on their own territory. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3850.32s)]
*  It's just that it wasn't announced. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3854.32s)]
*  We pre-announce ours. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3857.32s)]
*  No one is surprised by them. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3859.32s)]
*  Whereas the exercise that Russia did [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3861.32s)]
*  was a snap exercise, which is a bit destabilizing. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3863.36s)]
*  Until May of this year, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3866.36s)]
*  retired four-star general Philip Breedlove [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3869.36s)]
*  was the supreme allied commander of NATO [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3872.36s)]
*  with responsibility for the Arctic. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3875.36s)]
*  What else is destabilizing, he says, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3878.36s)]
*  is Russia's military buildup [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3881.36s)]
*  along something called the Northern Sea Route [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3883.36s)]
*  skirting the Russian Arctic coastline. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3886.36s)]
*  The route could become an alternative to the Suez Canal [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3889.36s)]
*  saving huge amounts of time and money [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3892.4s)]
*  for the commercial shipping industry. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3895.4s)]
*  I have heard as much as 28 days decrease [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3898.4s)]
*  in some of the transit from the northern European markets [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3901.4s)]
*  to the Asian markets. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3905.4s)]
*  That is an incredible economic opportunity [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3907.4s)]
*  and it could be a very big boon to business around the world. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3910.4s)]
*  What would it mean if the Russians did gain control [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3914.4s)]
*  over the northern sea route? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3917.4s)]
*  If the Russians had the ability [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3919.44s)]
*  to militarily hold that at ransom, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3921.44s)]
*  that is a big lever over the world economy. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3924.44s)]
*  So tell us in a nutshell what's happening. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3927.44s)]
*  Along that route, what we see is Russia [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3930.44s)]
*  upgrading over 50 airfields and ports, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3933.44s)]
*  14 of them to be done this year, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3936.44s)]
*  increasing the number of ground troops, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3939.44s)]
*  putting in surface-to-air missiles, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3942.44s)]
*  putting in sensors that could be used to guide weapons [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3944.44s)]
*  that could be used to deny access. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3947.48s)]
*  In 2007, Russia went so far as to plant its flag [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3950.48s)]
*  on the seafloor under the North Pole. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3954.48s)]
*  I think it's important to understand [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3957.48s)]
*  what the Deputy Prime Minister said, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3960.48s)]
*  that the Arctic is a part of Russia, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3963.48s)]
*  that they will provide the defense for the Arctic [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3966.48s)]
*  and that they will make money in the Arctic [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3970.48s)]
*  and that the Western world may therefore [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3973.52s)]
*  bring sanctions on them, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3976.52s)]
*  but that's okay because tanks don't need visas. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3978.52s)]
*  I think it sends a pretty clear message. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3981.52s)]
*  The U.S. has not tried to match the Russian buildup, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3984.52s)]
*  the Navy relying on its fleet of nuclear [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3988.52s)]
*  and attack submarines, the most powerful in the world. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3991.52s)]
*  When we were there, the Navy was conducting [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3995.52s)]
*  a submarine warfare exercise, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=3998.52s)]
*  something it does in the Arctic every two years. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4000.56s)]
*  When a sub surfaces in the Arctic, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4003.56s)]
*  they use shovels to carve a visual landmark [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4006.56s)]
*  in the ice that the sub can see. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4009.56s)]
*  X literally marks the spot. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4012.56s)]
*  But that X is a moving target because of the drifting ice, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4015.56s)]
*  which makes maneuvering a windowless steel cylinder [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4019.56s)]
*  the size of a football field [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4023.56s)]
*  to such a pinpoint location seem impossible. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4025.56s)]
*  But on this day, the skipper and his crew, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4029.6s)]
*  punching up through thick ice, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4032.6s)]
*  nailed it on their first try. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4034.6s)]
*  It took a few minutes for the sail, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4037.6s)]
*  the shark fin on top, to completely emerge. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4039.6s)]
*  There they are. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4042.6s)]
*  When they popped the hatch, a special guest climbed out, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4044.6s)]
*  the Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4047.6s)]
*  who'd been on board for five days [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4050.6s)]
*  taking part in the naval exercise. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4052.6s)]
*  What does it mean that the Secretary of the Navy [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4055.6s)]
*  has come up to the Arctic? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4058.64s)]
*  Is there a special significance to you being here? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4060.64s)]
*  Our responsibilities are increasing [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4063.64s)]
*  as the Arctic ice melts, as the climate changes, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4065.64s)]
*  and so the Navy has got to be here. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4068.64s)]
*  We've got to provide that presence, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4071.64s)]
*  and I hope that my presence emphasizes what we do. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4073.64s)]
*  As he flew off to Alaska, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4077.64s)]
*  we climbed down the ladder [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4079.64s)]
*  into the fast-attack, nuclear-powered USS Hampton [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4081.64s)]
*  and went through a 100-degree change in temperature [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4085.68s)]
*  from 25 below to about 75. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4088.68s)]
*  Do you feel claustrophobic? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4092.68s)]
*  Oh, no, not at all. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4094.68s)]
*  You get used to it. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4096.68s)]
*  Commander of the Hampton, Theron Davis, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4097.68s)]
*  took us to the control room [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4099.68s)]
*  as the crew prepared to submerge. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4101.68s)]
*  Ferry roll. Stationary dive the ship. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4103.68s)]
*  Stationary dive the ship, aye, sir. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4105.68s)]
*  Dive. Stationary dive the ship. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4107.68s)]
*  Make your depth 150 feet. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4108.68s)]
*  What he and his crew of 20-somethings are practicing [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4110.68s)]
*  is something subs only do in the Arctic. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4113.72s)]
*  HONKING [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4116.72s)]
*  Diving down through new ice [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4119.72s)]
*  that had formed around the sub. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4121.72s)]
*  What is that? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4123.72s)]
*  That's the ice breaking away. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4125.72s)]
*  It's the first time we've surfaced [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4127.72s)]
*  through this thick ice in state of Fialis Laos, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4129.72s)]
*  so that's the ice that's beside us, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4131.72s)]
*  and as we go down, it's going to crack away from the hull. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4133.72s)]
*  We're listing. I'm tilting this one. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4136.72s)]
*  Sight on the left fence. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4138.72s)]
*  Sight on the left fence, aye, sir. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4140.72s)]
*  That's only water. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4142.76s)]
*  Once they get to a cruising level, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4144.76s)]
*  they practice hide-and-seek with another sub. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4146.76s)]
*  In some of the exercises, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4149.76s)]
*  they also test fire blank torpedoes. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4151.76s)]
*  So I'm going to show you a torpedo tube. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4154.76s)]
*  One of their challenges is ice keels, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4157.76s)]
*  huge chunks of ice that jut down from the surface [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4160.76s)]
*  and confuse sonar-guided torpedoes [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4163.76s)]
*  that can't distinguish them from enemy submarines. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4166.76s)]
*  So what we're working on is saying, [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4169.76s)]
*  hey, how can we fix that? [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4171.8s)]
*  How do we know we can go and shoot a weapon in the ice [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4173.8s)]
*  and get a hit? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4176.8s)]
*  So now we have to go up there and figure that out? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4178.8s)]
*  We return to the surface. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4180.8s)]
*  We're coming up right now. We're one, two, two feet. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4182.8s)]
*  One American sub in a region [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4184.8s)]
*  with a growing Russian military presence. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4187.8s)]
*  During our last day at the camp, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4190.8s)]
*  something dramatic happened. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4193.8s)]
*  A crack in the ice along the perimeter [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4195.8s)]
*  became a giant lake. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4197.8s)]
*  New fissures formed right through the heart of the camp [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4199.84s)]
*  up to the doorstep of the command post. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4202.84s)]
*  Everything was packed up quickly for an emergency evacuation, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4205.84s)]
*  a reminder that the most formidable adversary here [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4209.84s)]
*  may not be Russian forces, but the forces of nature. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4213.84s)]
*  You'd think when you knew that Andy Rooney [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4217.88s)]
*  has been everywhere and done everything. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4219.88s)]
*  Well, not quite. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4221.88s)]
*  It was not long ago when there were just three things [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4223.88s)]
*  I'd never done in my life. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4226.88s)]
*  Tonight, as I sit before you, there are only two. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4228.88s)]
*  I have now been down in a nuclear attack submarine. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4231.88s)]
*  I boarded a plane and flew to the North. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4234.88s)]
*  I was in the air for a few minutes [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4237.88s)]
*  and then I was on the ground. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4239.88s)]
*  I was on the ground. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4241.88s)]
*  I was on the ground. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4243.88s)]
*  I boarded the nuclear attack submarine. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4245.92s)]
*  I boarded the Miami in Groton, Connecticut. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4247.92s)]
*  I stood on a deck they called a sail [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4250.92s)]
*  while we left the harbor under the bridge. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4252.92s)]
*  All I knew about submarines was from old movies [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4257.92s)]
*  and I was surprised how much it was really like them. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4260.92s)]
*  When we submerged, they actually shouted, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4263.92s)]
*  Dive, dive! [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4266.92s)]
*  Dive, dive! [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4268.92s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4270.96s)]
*  Dive, dive! [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4272.96s)]
*  I thought that was only in Hollywood. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4274.96s)]
*  Standing up. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4276.96s)]
*  And they really did look through a periscope. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4278.96s)]
*  They called it Dancing with the One-Eyed Lady. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4280.96s)]
*  I was never more impressed with young Americans [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4283.96s)]
*  than I was watching the men, boys, many of them, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4286.96s)]
*  with no more than a high school education, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4289.96s)]
*  run one of the most complicated machines ever designed. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4291.96s)]
*  First time on study course 174. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4294.96s)]
*  A nuclear submarine. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4296.96s)]
*  The Miami is 362 feet long, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4299.0s)]
*  stuffed full of machinery and electronics. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4302.0s)]
*  It's an incredible package and every inch counts. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4305.0s)]
*  There are so many things that have to be done [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4308.0s)]
*  to keep humans alive underwater. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4311.0s)]
*  All I could think of down there was getting hit [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4313.0s)]
*  by a depth charge and being trapped inside to drown. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4316.0s)]
*  The crew seemed immune to that thought. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4320.0s)]
*  No, not at all, not anymore. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4323.0s)]
*  When I first joined, I thought about it, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4325.0s)]
*  but I don't even think about it anymore. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4328.04s)]
*  Because it has nuclear power, the boat, they call it a boat, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4330.04s)]
*  can stay out for as long as the food lasts. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4333.04s)]
*  Food is entertainment on board. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4336.04s)]
*  The guys eat four meals a day. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4338.04s)]
*  If it's food like this, it's lunch. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4340.04s)]
*  If it's leftovers and stuff, it's midnight. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4342.04s)]
*  If it's six and you get broccoli and mashed potatoes... [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4345.04s)]
*  So you really don't need a watch. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4349.04s)]
*  Whatever they feed you when you get up. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4351.04s)]
*  They share one cramped toilet and shower facility. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4353.04s)]
*  His bunk is all the privacy a sailor has. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4357.08s)]
*  The sailor in the top bunk [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4360.08s)]
*  has the toughest time going to bed. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4362.08s)]
*  Unlucky submariners sleep beneath 10 tons of torpedo. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4367.08s)]
*  Each torpedo costs $1 million. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4371.08s)]
*  The submarine is a weapon of war and no one forgets it. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4374.08s)]
*  There are a combination of torpedoes and cruise missiles [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4377.08s)]
*  plus we have 12 vertical tubes for cruise missiles out front. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4380.08s)]
*  Chief of the watch, emergency blow all main ballast tanks. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4383.08s)]
*  The best part of the trip was coming up. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4386.12s)]
*  Just the opposite of landing in an airplane [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4389.12s)]
*  and twice as exhilarating. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4392.12s)]
*  Makes you happy and a little surprised [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4394.12s)]
*  to be alive and breathing again. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4396.12s)]
*  If you think the younger generation in our country [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4398.12s)]
*  has gone to hell, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4401.12s)]
*  you haven't been down with a submarine crew. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4403.12s)]
*  It brought back all the good memories I have [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4406.12s)]
*  of why we won World War II. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSPR887Qhz8&t=4409.12s)]
