# Courageous Women | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [August 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk)
*  She wore a scarf in our first interview because she did not want you to know her. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=0.0s)]
*  She was a humble 21-year-old from a poor farm family. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=18.2s)]
*  Her dream was to own a hair salon in her village of nearly 2,000. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=22.28s)]
*  But that was before the massacre. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=27.72s)]
*  She didn't want to be on 60 Minutes, but she needed the world to know what ISIS did. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  The murder, the rape, the genocide of her people. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=36.6s)]
*  Nearly six years ago in Iraq, we discovered this hesitant, frightened woman. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=40.94s)]
*  We did not imagine that her scarf concealed not only her identity, but also a fierce invincibility, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=45.92s)]
*  which would lead her four years after our interview to the highest honor the world has to give. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=53.8s)]
*  We found her here among refugees who survived the invasion of the ISIS terrorist army. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=59.8s)]
*  Her people are Yazidis, a minority in northern Iraq that is poor, persecuted, and bound by [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  faith to its revered Mount Sinjar. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=77.44s)]
*  In 2014, ISIS invaded. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=81.56s)]
*  Two months later, we came to report on the atrocities of the self-described Islamic State. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=84.68s)]
*  Of course, no country on earth recognizes that state. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=91.68s)]
*  But if it had a border, this would be it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=95.3s)]
*  Beyond that border was the Yazidi homeland, where the faithful practice a religion that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=98.92s)]
*  predates Islam by 3,000 years. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=104.54s)]
*  In ISIS's perversion of the Muslim faith, the Yazidis were non-believers, condemned [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=108.16s)]
*  to slavery and death. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=115.32s)]
*  On Friday, August 15th, at 1130 a.m., they entered our village and told us all to come [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=119.74s)]
*  to the school. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=125.08s)]
*  There, the women and kids were put upstairs and the men downstairs. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=126.08s)]
*  What happened to you at that point? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=130.88s)]
*  As we were entering the school, I was with one of my brothers. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  There, we saw a bulldozer. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=138.28s)]
*  And I asked my brother, why is there a bulldozer here? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=139.88s)]
*  He replied, to throw dirt on the bodies when they're done killing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  Her brother was right. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=148.16s)]
*  The Yazidis, about half a million, were defenseless civilians. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=149.52s)]
*  Thousands of men and elder women were executed. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=154.8s)]
*  Boys, aged seven and older, were forced into the ISIS army. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=157.4s)]
*  What happened next? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=162.4s)]
*  They started loading up 150 girls in four dump trucks. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=163.68s)]
*  More than 3,000 women and girls, as young as nine, were trucked into slavery. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  She says she was sold and raped, sold and raped again, and then gang raped after a failed [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  escape. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=185.08s)]
*  What about the other members of your family? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=186.08s)]
*  I have no idea where my brothers are. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=193.6s)]
*  I want them all to return. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=196.0s)]
*  But most of all, I just want my mother. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=197.88s)]
*  Tell them I just want my mother. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=203.96s)]
*  She seemed broken. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=207.32s)]
*  But as our interview went on, her confidence grew. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=210.0s)]
*  As though she came to realize she wasn't speaking for herself, she was speaking for her people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  A few months later, she settled in Germany, joined a human rights group, and campaigned [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  for justice. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=227.2s)]
*  In 2018, the world learned her name because Nadia Murad was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=229.0s)]
*  The 2018 Peace Prize was meant to expose atrocities women suffer in war. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  The honor was shared with Dennis Mukwege, whose hospital treats the sexually assaulted [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  in the Democratic Republic of Congo. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm curious why you chose to speak with us five years ago. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=255.32s)]
*  At the beginning, rape was a big shame for me and for others to speak about, because [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=263.56s)]
*  it would have remained a shame on you, on your family, and on your people. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=268.4s)]
*  The biggest incentive that made me talk was those left behind, including my mother and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=275.0s)]
*  sisters. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=279.88s)]
*  I knew what was happening to those in the captivity of ISIS. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=280.88s)]
*  Nadia Murad was captive nine days when the last man who bought her left a door unlocked. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  Kind-hearted strangers smuggled her across the Islamic State line. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  She became a U.N. human rights ambassador, began learning English, wrote a memoir, and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=297.79999999999995s)]
*  vowed to see ISIS in court. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=303.92s)]
*  But for that, she needed a lawyer. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=307.0s)]
*  I met Nadia after a colleague called me and said, I have a new case for you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=310.04s)]
*  And I said, no thanks, I'm busy. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  And he said, there's just an extraordinary young woman I want you to meet, give me an [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=318.04s)]
*  hour. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=321.32s)]
*  It didn't take an hour for leading human rights attorney Amal Clooney to take the case. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=322.32s)]
*  I saw it as a test of the international system. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=327.88s)]
*  It was so egregious because it involved ISIS, it involved a clear case of genocide, it [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=330.84s)]
*  involved sexual slavery at a scale that we haven't seen in modern times. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  And I thought, if the U.N. can't act in this case, then what does the international rule [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=341.96s)]
*  of law even mean? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=347.23999999999995s)]
*  By 2015, not one free Yazidi remained in their homeland. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  This wasn't just war. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=354.28s)]
*  By international law, the executions, rape and kidnapping were war crimes. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=355.4s)]
*  This was the same dilemma that the world had after the atrocities of Nazi Germany. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=361.28s)]
*  And it's the U.S. under President Truman and President Roosevelt that said, no, we have [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=368.5s)]
*  to have trials because there must be a judicial record of the atrocities committed by the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=373.47999999999996s)]
*  Nazis. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=377.76s)]
*  Because today you do have people denying that there were gas chambers. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  And what do you have to point to? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=382.67999999999995s)]
*  You can go back and say, well, there are 4,000 documents that were submitted as exhibits [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=383.8s)]
*  in the Nuremberg trials, and the Yazidis deserve nothing less than that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=388.24s)]
*  And there might be similar stacks of evidence of the crimes against the Yazidis, but Clooney [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=392.34000000000003s)]
*  feared securing it was a race against time. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=398.04s)]
*  You had mass graves that weren't secured, where the Yazidis knew their relatives were [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=401.48s)]
*  buried and nobody was exhuming them. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  And also I noticed that witnesses were becoming more and more reluctant to speak out as time [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=408.24s)]
*  went by. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=412.44s)]
*  There was only so much we could do as a small team of lawyers, and we said this is the responsibility [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=414.08s)]
*  of the U.N. and it's the responsibility of the most powerful body within the U.N., which [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=417.92s)]
*  is the Security Council. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=422.4s)]
*  Had you ever heard of the U.N. Security Council? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=424.52s)]
*  Never. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=427.32s)]
*  In 2015, just a year after we met her, Nadia Murad asked the Security Council to hold ISIS [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=428.32s)]
*  accountable. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=435.76s)]
*  I've seen what they've done to boys and girls, all those who commit the crime of trafficking [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=436.76s)]
*  and genocide need to be brought to justice. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  The Security Council voted to approve a first step. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=446.72s)]
*  In 2017, it created an investigative team to collect evidence of ISIS's crimes in Iraq. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=450.04s)]
*  The team began exhuming some of the 202 mass graves that are known. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=456.88s)]
*  Now the question is whether the evidence will ever be heard. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=463.24s)]
*  Iraqi courts are convicting thousands of ISIS suspects of terrorism, but none has been tried [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=467.08s)]
*  for the crime of genocide against the Yazidis. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=473.04s)]
*  Small pockets of ISIS fighters remain in Syria and Iraq, but U.S. and Iraqi troops have shattered [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=477.72s)]
*  ISIS as a cohesive military force. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=484.72s)]
*  Is that justice? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=488.32s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=489.32s)]
*  You know, if you speak to Yazidi witnesses, victims, survivors, they will say, it doesn't [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=490.64s)]
*  help me if somebody's killed in a drone strike. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=497.48s)]
*  In terms of justice, that means something very different. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=500.24s)]
*  That means being able to be in a courtroom and look their abusers in the eye and tell [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=503.06s)]
*  the world what happened, what ISIS did to them. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=507.92s)]
*  And that hasn't happened yet. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=511.38s)]
*  It has happened before in other atrocities. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=514.4s)]
*  Last year, a U.N.-backed court in Cambodia convicted two former officials of genocide [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=517.96s)]
*  40 years after the Khmer Rouge murdered 1.7 million. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=523.24s)]
*  Beginning in the 1990s, U.N. war crime trials were held for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=529.36s)]
*  But Iraq is not a member of the International Criminal Court and has not agreed to war crime [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=536.5s)]
*  trials of its own. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=542.34s)]
*  What we would like to see is an openness by the Iraqis to actually have international [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=544.42s)]
*  judges be involved in these trials, potentially international prosecutors. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=548.9399999999999s)]
*  There are different ways of designing it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=552.78s)]
*  The Iraqi government could enter into a treaty with the U.N. or there could be an international [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=554.74s)]
*  court and the Iraqis could agree to transfer those responsible for international crimes [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=558.9s)]
*  to that court. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=563.56s)]
*  Today, peace, if not justice, has settled into the folds of Mount Sinjar. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=565.06s)]
*  Four days after accepting the Nobel, Nadia Marad returned with the Yazidi man she would [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=574.78s)]
*  soon marry and two replicas of her peace prize. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=580.3399999999999s)]
*  This is what the absence of justice looks like. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=586.86s)]
*  The demands of the desperate focused on a woman abducted at 21 and now returning bearing [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=590.76s)]
*  the weight of a seven-ounce medal. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=597.9s)]
*  The morning that I won the Nobel Prize, I asked my husband Abed to see if there was [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=602.5s)]
*  a way I could decline because the prize would make my life difficult. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=606.98s)]
*  But fate and God sometimes bring you something so that you can stop crimes and help others. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=613.94s)]
*  Has the Nobel Prize changed your hopes for the future? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=620.34s)]
*  Now people look at me like I can rebuild Sinjar, that I can bring more help for the victims [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=629.14s)]
*  and that I can take care of the orphans. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=635.98s)]
*  But without support, this is not going to happen by just having a Nobel. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=640.14s)]
*  In her village, she said, I have left a Nobel Prize at the Iraqi parliament. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=649.3s)]
*  I hope Iraq, after 4,000 years, will recognize Yazidis. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=654.7s)]
*  We have always been second-class citizens. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=659.5400000000001s)]
*  Later, she walked to a site that held the answer to the desperate question she asked [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=663.7s)]
*  in our first interview. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=671.5s)]
*  The long green depression in the earth was a mass grave, her mother's grave. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=673.38s)]
*  She said, dear mother, my poor mother. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=683.58s)]
*  You left a replica of your Nobel Peace Prize at your mother's grave. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=690.7s)]
*  What do you think she would have thought of that? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=697.9000000000001s)]
*  I wonder if she knows that I have talked to the world about her silent death, the killing [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=706.38s)]
*  of her six sons and her two nieces. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=710.94s)]
*  I often feel that what I have been doing is because of her. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=714.1s)]
*  I wish that she would know about it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=719.7s)]
*  She may be happy because the world now knows what ISIS has done. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=722.1400000000001s)]
*  This is the school where Nadia Murad was separated from her family. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=728.4200000000001s)]
*  Five years later, the murdered and missing are present, but unaccounted for. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=733.5400000000001s)]
*  All together, Nadia, how many members of your family were murdered? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=739.74s)]
*  We were 48 brothers, mothers, sisters, nephews and nieces in our family. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=746.86s)]
*  Nine were killed and three are missing. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=753.1s)]
*  The rest who were rescued now live in refugee camps. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=756.02s)]
*  There isn't much for refugees to return to. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=763.34s)]
*  Many homes were wrecked or looted of everything but memories. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=766.66s)]
*  Today Nadia Murad is navigating without a chart, steering by the constellation of her [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=775.18s)]
*  people's dreams. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=780.6999999999999s)]
*  An accidental leader, facing questions she cannot answer. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=782.6s)]
*  Will they have homes? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=786.78s)]
*  Will there be justice? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=788.3199999999999s)]
*  It's estimated as many as 5,000 Yazidis were murdered, 6,000 abducted, nearly 4,000 are [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=790.38s)]
*  missing still. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=798.14s)]
*  With no international trial scheduled for these crimes, evidence from mass graves is [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=800.3s)]
*  being entombed in Baghdad where it will wait until the world that hears her voice shares [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=805.74s)]
*  her courage. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=812.9s)]
*  Whatever your view of the U.S. decision to end America's longest war and withdraw troops [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=820.38s)]
*  from Afghanistan, that country's fall to the Taliban in August of 2021 has unquestionably [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=828.62s)]
*  plunged that nation once again into a deep crisis. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=835.9399999999999s)]
*  Millions are facing famine and the economy is in shambles. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=840.9s)]
*  Those suffering the most are Afghan women and girls. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=845.56s)]
*  The Taliban has closed girls' schools beyond sixth grade and barred women from universities. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=850.26s)]
*  That means that girls are banned from anything beyond a grade school education. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=857.22s)]
*  Tonight though, we're going to tell you a story of hope about a group of Afghan girls [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=862.8199999999999s)]
*  who are in school. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=868.14s)]
*  As we first reported in February, they're at a school called Sola, the Afghan word for [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=870.3s)]
*  peace and also short for School of Leadership Afghanistan. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=876.12s)]
*  It was started by a young Afghan woman named Shabana Basish Rasook who knows firsthand [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=882.04s)]
*  the power of an education. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=888.28s)]
*  And though they had to flee Afghanistan in a harrowing escape, we found the girls of [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=890.92s)]
*  Sola back in the classroom, half a world away. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=896.0s)]
*  These are the busy streets of Kigali, Rwanda, a landlocked African nation that was once [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=903.44s)]
*  the site of a horrific genocide that killed nearly a million and left two million refugees. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=909.5200000000001s)]
*  Rwanda is now at peace and has become an unlikely place of refuge for almost two years to the [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=916.5600000000001s)]
*  girls of Sola. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=924.32s)]
*  And they seem to be settling in. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=926.8800000000001s)]
*  The evening we arrived at Sola's temporary campus here, the sixth and seventh grades [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=930.72s)]
*  were holding a geography competition. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=935.96s)]
*  Classes here are taught in English. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=940.86s)]
*  The girls were racing to identify nearly 200 countries all around the globe. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=944.4s)]
*  They're wearing masks not to protect against COVID, but to hide their identities to protect [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=949.88s)]
*  their families still in Afghanistan. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=955.6s)]
*  My name is Zahra. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=958.24s)]
*  Zahra's family has left the country so she can show her face. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=960.0s)]
*  Sariah's and Najia's are still there. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=964.08s)]
*  You knew every country in the world. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=967.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=970.64s)]
*  You like it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=971.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=972.64s)]
*  You like contests. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=973.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=974.64s)]
*  They're so passionate. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=975.64s)]
*  They're so active. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=976.64s)]
*  They're so eager. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=977.64s)]
*  They're so interested. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=978.64s)]
*  Shabana Basij Rasook is Sola's founder and single-minded leader. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=979.64s)]
*  How are you all doing? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=986.36s)]
*  Good. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=988.36s)]
*  And just over five feet tall, Shabana started creating Sola when she was still a student [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=989.64s)]
*  herself. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=995.4s)]
*  Her story and her commitment to educating girls goes back to 1996, when Afghanistan [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=996.64s)]
*  fell to the Taliban the first time. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1004.48s)]
*  She was six years old and all girls' schools were closed. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1007.72s)]
*  But Shabana's parents, a former general and an educator, refused to keep their daughters [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1012.44s)]
*  locked up at home. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1018.0s)]
*  They heard about a secret school run out of a former principal's living room and saw [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1020.2s)]
*  an opportunity, despite the danger, for Shabana and her older sister to be educated. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1025.16s)]
*  The Taliban did not allow women to go outside alone, so my parents dressed me up as a boy [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1031.88s)]
*  so that I could accompany my sister to and from that secret school. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1037.88s)]
*  That was the best way that both of us could receive an education. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1041.72s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1044.52s)]
*  So they dressed you as a boy. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1045.64s)]
*  My mom cut my hair. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1048.48s)]
*  I wore boys' clothes. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1051.48s)]
*  Pants. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1052.96s)]
*  Pants and t-shirt and, yep, bus cut. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1053.96s)]
*  And the family carefully mapped out their routes. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1057.2800000000002s)]
*  You know, you take different streets every day so you don't create a routine. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1059.88s)]
*  The same shopkeeper at a certain convenience store should not notice you every day. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1064.1200000000001s)]
*  So you were always afraid or they were always afraid you'd get caught. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1070.1200000000001s)]
*  They never knew when or if we would return home. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1074.0s)]
*  But even after a close call where Shabana and her sister were followed and begged their [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1078.52s)]
*  parents to stop sending them to school, her mom and dad said no. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1083.8s)]
*  They told us things like you could be forced to leave your home. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1089.02s)]
*  You could be forced to become a refugee. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1092.2s)]
*  You could lose any material possessions that you have. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1093.84s)]
*  But the one thing that can never be taken away from you is your education. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1098.24s)]
*  When the Taliban fell after the U.S. invasion in 2001, Shabana went to a real school for [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1104.68s)]
*  the first time and she excelled, winning a place in a State Department program to spend [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1111.48s)]
*  a year of high school in the U.S. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1117.52s)]
*  I was randomly placed with this lovely host family in Wisconsin where I gained 40 pounds. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1119.96s)]
*  But that wasn't the only way the year changed her. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1128.32s)]
*  What struck me the most was living in a society for the first time in my life where girls [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1131.6s)]
*  had no concerns whatsoever that their freedom to attend school could be taken away from [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1139.12s)]
*  them anytime, which is something that every single Afghan girl who's lucky enough to [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1145.84s)]
*  go to school lives with. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1151.9599999999998s)]
*  And you can't blame them, can you? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1154.26s)]
*  No, I can't because Afghanistan is the only country in the world that won't let girls [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1155.96s)]
*  go to school. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1162.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1163.3200000000002s)]
*  So, um... [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1164.3200000000002s)]
*  Why are you tearing up? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1171.72s)]
*  That Afghanistan's the only country? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1176.48s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1178.48s)]
*  Shabana's commitment to her homeland runs deep. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1181.48s)]
*  When she got a scholarship to attend Middlebury College in Vermont, she started working not [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1184.84s)]
*  on building a great life for herself in the U.S., but what she could do for Afghanistan. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1190.3999999999999s)]
*  Her answer? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1196.86s)]
*  Start a school. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1198.56s)]
*  And by the time she graduated in 2011, an early version of SOLA was already up and running [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1199.8799999999999s)]
*  in Kabul. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1206.9199999999998s)]
*  I heard that it's different. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1208.0s)]
*  It's a leadership program. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1210.04s)]
*  Fatima was an early SOLA student. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1211.48s)]
*  You were encouraged to speak up? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1214.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1216.12s)]
*  You liked that? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1217.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1218.12s)]
*  I was like, wow. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1219.12s)]
*  I thought, like, it's such an awesome school. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1221.32s)]
*  Fatima's two younger sisters, Aideen and Sajia, took notice. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1224.48s)]
*  Sajia got in next. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1229.56s)]
*  And I was like, well, next year it's my turn. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1231.6399999999999s)]
*  Aideen remembers trying to impress Shabana, the school's founder, in her interview. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1234.28s)]
*  I was reading a lot of books and I was writing their summaries down. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1239.9199999999998s)]
*  And I was like, you know what? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1244.04s)]
*  I should take this and show her. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1245.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, I'm a smart kid. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1246.96s)]
*  You should send me here. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1248.52s)]
*  It worked. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1250.2s)]
*  Aideen started as a sixth grader in 2016, the year SOLA expanded to become a full-fledged [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1251.2s)]
*  sixth to twelfth grade girls boarding school, the only one in Afghanistan funded as a U.S. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1258.76s)]
*  nonprofit through grants and donations. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1265.48s)]
*  There were daily assemblies and the school's own special Pledge of Allegiance. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1268.92s)]
*  We all are Afghans. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1274.0s)]
*  We love Afghanistan. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1275.0s)]
*  We will try our best and work hard to improve this beautiful country. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1276.0s)]
*  Shabana's goal was both to educate her students and serve the nation by training a generation [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1280.3600000000001s)]
*  of leaders from Afghanistan's various regions and religious sects. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1286.88s)]
*  My roommate was Shia and I was Sunni and it was my first time to talk to a Shia girl. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1292.3200000000002s)]
*  And it was so interesting to hear from her. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1298.72s)]
*  Do you deliberately want the children of conservative families? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1301.0400000000002s)]
*  We certainly create an environment in which even the most conservative families in Afghanistan [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1305.72s)]
*  would feel comfortable sending their daughters. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1312.16s)]
*  Do they? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1314.88s)]
*  They do. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1315.88s)]
*  Do you teach the Quran? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1316.88s)]
*  We do. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1318.16s)]
*  For these young women to be effective leaders of Afghanistan, they have to be great Muslims, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1319.2s)]
*  great Afghans, and highly educated. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1325.64s)]
*  At the start of 2021, SOLA was thriving. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1328.32s)]
*  Shabana had secured land in Kabul and construction was underway on a new campus. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1332.72s)]
*  There were a record number of applications with students enrolled from all over the country [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1339.08s)]
*  and SOLA graduates were doing just what Shabana had envisioned. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1344.84s)]
*  Fatima had finished college and was working at the Afghan Ministry of Finance. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1349.68s)]
*  I was a professional woman. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1355.36s)]
*  I was contributing. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1357.08s)]
*  I also had all my friends who were educated women and men as well. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1358.36s)]
*  So there was a little community. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1362.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1364.48s)]
*  But the Trump administration had been negotiating with a newly emboldened Taliban, promising [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1365.48s)]
*  a withdrawal of U.S. troops. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1371.96s)]
*  And then in April of 2021, President Biden announced an unconditional exit. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1374.3999999999999s)]
*  I concluded that it's time to end America's longest war. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1380.9199999999998s)]
*  It's time for American troops to come home. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1385.28s)]
*  I knew then that it was a matter of time before it was going to be irresponsible of me to [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1387.72s)]
*  run an all-girls boarding school in Kabul. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1394.76s)]
*  She came up with the idea of taking the whole SOLA community, students and staff abroad [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1398.2s)]
*  for a semester while the American withdrawal played out. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1405.12s)]
*  So she started searching for a country, ideally one nearby, that would accept them. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1409.24s)]
*  But the warmest response she got by far was from Rwanda. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1416.0s)]
*  And she grabbed it. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1421.04s)]
*  To Rwanda? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1422.04s)]
*  We were going to go to a place called Rwanda. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1423.04s)]
*  Did you know anything? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1425.7s)]
*  Like, we all went and searched and then we found out that it was in Africa. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1426.7s)]
*  And I was like, wow. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1430.32s)]
*  Oh my God, I'm so excited. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1431.32s)]
*  Some of SOLA's alums, including Sajiya and Fatima, were asked to come as well. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1434.12s)]
*  So was the idea at that moment that you were escaping and that you weren't going to come [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1439.6799999999998s)]
*  back for a while? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1445.28s)]
*  No. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1446.56s)]
*  The idea was that the security is getting worse. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1447.56s)]
*  We would leave for a semester and then if the security gets better, we would come back. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1450.56s)]
*  If not, we would stay there for a year or more. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1456.4799999999998s)]
*  What was the atmosphere in Kabul at that point? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1459.2399999999998s)]
*  The provinces were falling one after another. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1463.2s)]
*  But then we were not hoping for Kabul to fall this soon. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1467.8400000000001s)]
*  The U.S. government wasn't expecting Kabul to fall soon either. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1472.44s)]
*  As American soldiers prepared for an announced end of August departure, SOLA brought in passport [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1476.72s)]
*  officials on August 14th to process the girls' paperwork for flights a few days later. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1483.16s)]
*  They worked into the night, but unbeknownst to all of them, it was too late. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1490.32s)]
*  The Taliban were closing in and would enter Kabul in just a few hours. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1495.88s)]
*  It was 5 a.m. in the morning when I got a knock on my door. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1501.64s)]
*  One of my teachers came and said that you guys have to leave SOLA in five minutes. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1507.4s)]
*  And I said that, why? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1512.32s)]
*  And she said if the Taliban come, they will know that here is a school and they will kill [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1513.88s)]
*  all of us. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1517.96s)]
*  All of the girls were shouting and all of us crying, what should we do? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1518.96s)]
*  Taliban came to Kabul and took all of Kabul. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1523.76s)]
*  In the chaos of the Taliban takeover and government collapse, SOLA quickly sent students home [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1527.92s)]
*  with teachers and staff. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1534.56s)]
*  Shabana scrambled to transform what was to be an orderly departure into a sudden, life-threatening [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1536.8400000000001s)]
*  escape. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1544.52s)]
*  At first, she had to keep a promise, one she'd made years earlier to a student's father. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1546.56s)]
*  He said, promise me when the Taliban come to Kabul that you will burn my daughter's [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1553.1599999999999s)]
*  records. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1560.48s)]
*  If they find out that she's a student here, they will kill me and my family. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1561.48s)]
*  So Shabana did something heartbreaking. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1568.8s)]
*  Set fire in the school's furnace and courtyard to the hard-earned records of all of SOLA's [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1571.88s)]
*  students. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1579.0400000000002s)]
*  It was incredibly painful. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1580.0400000000002s)]
*  It felt like making them disappear. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1583.1200000000001s)]
*  The girls of SOLA, their escape from Kabul, and how they're doing today when we come [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1588.1000000000001s)]
*  back. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1593.96s)]
*  Most of us remember the desperate, frantic crowds trying to get out of Kabul after the [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1601.88s)]
*  Taliban takeover in August 2021. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1612.2800000000002s)]
*  Among them were the students, teachers, staff, and staff families of SOLA, 256 people in [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1616.3200000000002s)]
*  all. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1624.0400000000002s)]
*  SOLA's founder, Shabana Basish Rassouk, managed to get all of them on U.S. approved [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1625.2s)]
*  lists to leave the country. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1631.2s)]
*  But getting them into the airport was another matter altogether. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1633.76s)]
*  There were a series of Taliban checkpoints, so arriving together as a girl school was [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1638.86s)]
*  out of the question. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1644.96s)]
*  SOLA divided the students into groups, with many posing as the children of staff members. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1647.1599999999999s)]
*  The call went out for all the groups to head to the airport on the morning of August 17th. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1654.08s)]
*  The previous day had been chaos. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1663.3799999999999s)]
*  People had been clinging to airplanes, and crowds had descended on the airport. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1667.1399999999999s)]
*  Sisters Fatima, Sajiya, and Aideen prepared to go there together. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1672.74s)]
*  We had our masks. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1677.8999999999999s)]
*  We made sure our scarves are put tightly, and we were wearing very long dresses. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1679.5s)]
*  When we left, my mom was telling us that make sure that you don't do eye contacts with [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1685.1s)]
*  the tulips. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1689.86s)]
*  So we were just really scared, and then it was just like... [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1690.86s)]
*  If I look down, they won't look at me. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1694.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1696.42s)]
*  By the time we got to close out to the airport, it was so crowded. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1697.42s)]
*  The weather is hot, and I have this black scarf and black mask, and it's suffocating. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1702.14s)]
*  Pupils were pushing each other and shouting, and all of the babies crying. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1709.06s)]
*  I saw Taliban, that they were shooting the guns and also the... [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1714.78s)]
*  They were shooting guns? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1720.02s)]
*  Like the bullets. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1721.02s)]
*  In the sky. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1722.02s)]
*  Someone took my scarf. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1723.02s)]
*  It was in my head, and then someone in the Taliban saw me, and they shouted, and I said [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1726.7s)]
*  that they will kill me now. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1731.74s)]
*  As a teacher quickly handed Najia a scarf, Fatima and her sisters were being jostled [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1733.62s)]
*  by the crowd. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1739.6999999999998s)]
*  Everybody was pushing, and in a moment, I noticed that my sisters aren't there. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1741.26s)]
*  At one point, she was gone. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1744.86s)]
*  So now it's just the two of you. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1747.2399999999998s)]
*  I remember sitting there and then crying, and I was like, I didn't want to go. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1748.4599999999998s)]
*  Can we just stop here? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1753.06s)]
*  You know, let's just go back. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1754.06s)]
*  Honestly, I understand. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1755.9799999999998s)]
*  I probably would have done just what you did. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1758.4199999999998s)]
*  It was a tragedy, you know, with women having their very young kids. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1760.78s)]
*  I was like, I just can't take this anymore. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1766.06s)]
*  I really didn't know what to do, because she was not listening to me. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1768.66s)]
*  And then one of Sula teachers came and told her that you gotta stand up, go, or stay here [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1772.3799999999999s)]
*  forever. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1778.78s)]
*  And then I took her hand, and then we went. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1780.24s)]
*  The three sisters were among more than 100 Sula students and staff, including Shabana, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1783.3999999999999s)]
*  who made it into the U.S. military-controlled airport to safety that day and were processed [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1789.5s)]
*  to leave on waiting jets. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1795.74s)]
*  Shabana was told her name was on a Taliban hit list, so she should get out right away [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1798.26s)]
*  with them. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1803.98s)]
*  But all the other students and teachers were still stuck in the crowds outside. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1804.98s)]
*  Shabana refused to go. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1811.38s)]
*  I knew if I left, it was game over. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1813.72s)]
*  Those who were stuck at different checkpoints had no way of getting through. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1817.14s)]
*  People were pushing us. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1821.64s)]
*  One of them was Zara. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1823.3000000000002s)]
*  Taliban was saying sit, and there was no place to sit. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1825.0600000000002s)]
*  Zara's group and others had to turn back while Shabana spent a first sleepless night inside [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1828.8600000000001s)]
*  the airport. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1835.5400000000002s)]
*  After two more days of waiting in these throngs, one last group of 52 was still stuck. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1837.38s)]
*  Shabana asked a U.S. Marine captain to accompany her out of the safety of the airport and [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1845.18s)]
*  back to the Taliban checkpoint. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1851.3s)]
*  Captain Nicholas Gray grabbed two members of his team and said, let's do this. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1854.3s)]
*  You were in the airport and went out? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1859.54s)]
*  And then went back. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1861.3400000000001s)]
*  This is what you do. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1862.3400000000001s)]
*  You have 10-year-old girls, 11-year-old girls, 15-year-old girls stuck on the other side. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1863.3400000000001s)]
*  You do anything you can to get them to safety. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1869.4s)]
*  And she shouted, Srya, Srya, come this way. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1873.34s)]
*  And I pushed, I pushed, I pushed, and I get her hand and... [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1875.74s)]
*  And she pulled you? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1878.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1879.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1880.6599999999999s)]
*  These pictures were taken as the very last group of students and Shabana, after three [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1881.6599999999999s)]
*  days and two nights in that airport, boarded the military transport plane that would at [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1887.4199999999998s)]
*  last fly them away. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1893.36s)]
*  She had managed to get everyone out, 256 people. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1895.76s)]
*  You have to say to yourself, I did it. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1901.58s)]
*  It's over. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1904.6999999999998s)]
*  I got everybody out. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1905.6999999999998s)]
*  It was finally having a moment to think about, oh, my God, this is it. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1907.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God, this is it. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1916.3s)]
*  So now you're looking to the future. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1918.6999999999998s)]
*  We're leaving, you know, and I was taking with me from Afghanistan some of the best [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1921.06s)]
*  educated girls, women leaders in the making. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1928.9s)]
*  I felt so heartbroken for our people, for Afghanistan. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1934.02s)]
*  I felt heartbroken for the very people who are leaving. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1939.3400000000001s)]
*  They are some of the most wanted talent in Afghanistan. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1942.46s)]
*  And as soon as they step outside of this airport, they're going to be seen as unwanted refugees [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1946.74s)]
*  wherever they end up. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1953.5s)]
*  Hello. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1955.18s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1956.18s)]
*  But her students are having a completely different experience. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1957.74s)]
*  In Rwanda, they have been welcomed. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1961.8600000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1964.6200000000001s)]
*  How are you today? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1965.6200000000001s)]
*  We found them dressed in new school uniforms since each of them had fled with just a backpack. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1966.8s)]
*  I love what you're wearing. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1973.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1975.3s)]
*  They're hand sewn with Rwandan patterns to honor their adopted home. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1976.3s)]
*  Do you like it here? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1981.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1982.8600000000001s)]
*  You wouldn't know they'd been away from their families for more than a year. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1984.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1988.54s)]
*  Sola's temporary campus here feels like a haven. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1990.34s)]
*  It's a former hotel complex. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1994.62s)]
*  It's restaurant now a dining hall with classrooms converted from hotel suites. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=1997.3s)]
*  They're getting on with the business of learning, mastering math terms in English. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2005.02s)]
*  With many of their Afghan teachers now resettled as refugees in other countries, Sola has [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2012.98s)]
*  brought in new teachers from abroad. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2020.9s)]
*  This is a school for leadership. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2024.7s)]
*  You think that you'll become leaders? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2027.34s)]
*  I want to be a surgeon. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2031.1s)]
*  I want to help poor people in Afghanistan. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2033.06s)]
*  I want to be a politician. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2035.74s)]
*  A politician? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2037.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2038.98s)]
*  Sola wants to be an astronaut. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2039.98s)]
*  And finally from Zara. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2043.1s)]
*  I want to be a spy. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2044.98s)]
*  A spy? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2046.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2047.66s)]
*  That came out of nowhere. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2048.66s)]
*  How are the girls doing? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2052.66s)]
*  Our students, our girls have been consistently and remarkably focused. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2054.34s)]
*  It is beyond inspiring to see these young girls who know they have no idea when they're [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2059.5s)]
*  going to be able to reunite with their families. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2066.5s)]
*  But though they're more than 3,000 miles away, it is the 21st century. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2070.54s)]
*  One of the most striking scenes we saw here was the daily hour after classes end when [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2078.24s)]
*  girls can call their families. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2084.52s)]
*  Watching them scattered around the room is to feel the tremendous separation. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2088.46s)]
*  But Chibana also sees the closeness. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2095.82s)]
*  Yesterday I was watching swimming practice. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2098.98s)]
*  One of them said, I've been wanting to learn how to float for such a long time and I can [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2102.6600000000003s)]
*  finally do it today. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2107.2200000000003s)]
*  And I asked her, I said, do you share these kinds of moments with your family? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2108.2200000000003s)]
*  She said, I share every single thing with my family. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2112.82s)]
*  And they are so happy for me. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2117.1000000000004s)]
*  They tell me that they are happy because I am happy. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2119.0s)]
*  What's the reception been like in Rwanda? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2123.82s)]
*  Remarkable doesn't quite capture it. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2130.86s)]
*  I've had this conversation with so many Rwandans paying, please don't forget, we were also [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2132.5s)]
*  once refugees. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2138.02s)]
*  Here we are back in Rwanda. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2139.78s)]
*  You will go back home, but for the time being, welcome home to Rwanda. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2142.26s)]
*  Why does that happen? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2148.3s)]
*  Did I throw it? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2151.42s)]
*  No. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2152.42s)]
*  There is gravity. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2154.02s)]
*  Watching these girls learn, we were struck by the realization that they're among the [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2155.7400000000002s)]
*  only Afghan middle and high school girls out of a country of 40 million who are getting [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2162.1800000000003s)]
*  a formal education. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2168.6800000000003s)]
*  But knowing how fortunate they are has made hearing the news from Afghanistan that much [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2172.34s)]
*  more painful. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2177.28s)]
*  Women as female co-workers at the Ministry of Finance have all been replaced. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2179.34s)]
*  My female colleagues received phone calls saying that they should send one of their [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2185.0s)]
*  male family members to work instead of them. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2190.0s)]
*  So wait a minute, they were being told to send male relatives to take their jobs? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2192.78s)]
*  As long as they can do the job, they should send them. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2198.82s)]
*  A year ago March, the Taliban announced that girls' schools would reopen. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2202.9s)]
*  Girls flocked in only to be told hours later to go home and stay there. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2208.5s)]
*  All over social media were videos of these young girls crying. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2217.46s)]
*  And then I was so mad on everybody for not doing anything. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2223.06s)]
*  You mean the rest of the world? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2228.1s)]
*  This bunch of men has taken the control of our entire country and they're doing whatever [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2230.1s)]
*  they want. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2235.2200000000003s)]
*  Women have been ordered to cover themselves head to toe again. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2237.1s)]
*  They're banned from public parks. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2240.98s)]
*  And just months ago banned from universities as well. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2243.38s)]
*  History repeating itself. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2247.14s)]
*  And if there's one member of the solar community who understands what Afghan girls today are [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2251.42s)]
*  facing, it's Mariam, the school's longtime cleaning woman and now seamstress. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2256.7799999999997s)]
*  She knows the power of an education because she never got one. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2263.82s)]
*  The Taliban were in power at that time. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2269.82s)]
*  I mean the first time the Taliban were in power. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2271.98s)]
*  I was not allowed to go to school. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2274.82s)]
*  Girls could not study. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2277.26s)]
*  Mariam, can you read or write? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2278.82s)]
*  I would really like to, but I can't. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2283.3s)]
*  If I could have gone to school, I would have been very happy. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2285.98s)]
*  It was very hard for me. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2290.06s)]
*  But there is something that makes her happy these days. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2292.46s)]
*  Watching her ninth grade daughter, Zarmina, who is now a student at Sola. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2296.34s)]
*  Talking about Zarmina's future, we finally saw Mariam smile. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2301.82s)]
*  Are you proud of your daughter? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2306.54s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2308.5s)]
*  We cannot, under any circumstances, submit to Taliban's vision for Afghanistan. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2311.46s)]
*  And what does that mean for us? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2318.3s)]
*  It means continue to educate more Afghan girls. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2320.1s)]
*  But how? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2322.98s)]
*  Well, she's recruiting them over Zoom from Afghan refugee communities and camps in countries [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2323.98s)]
*  around the world to bring them here to Rwanda. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2330.86s)]
*  What should the U.S. government be doing, in your view? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2334.9s)]
*  The one thing that the U.S. policymakers cannot afford to do is to forget about Afghanistan. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2338.8199999999997s)]
*  Do not look away. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2346.16s)]
*  Do not look away from Afghanistan. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2348.1s)]
*  I cannot emphasize that enough. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2350.9s)]
*  And what she wants them to see, alongside the ongoing tragedy in that country, is Sola's [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2354.18s)]
*  vision. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2360.54s)]
*  Educated girls committed to one day being leaders of a different Afghanistan. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2361.54s)]
*  We all are Afghans, they say. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2370.48s)]
*  We love Afghanistan. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2373.24s)]
*  We will try our best and work hard to improve our beautiful country. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2375.18s)]
*  You say this every day. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2382.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2384.3799999999997s)]
*  We repeat it every day that it's in our heart. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2385.3799999999997s)]
*  Do you all think you'll go back? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2389.46s)]
*  Yeah, of course we will go. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2391.18s)]
*  Is it possible that you won't go back to Afghanistan? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2394.46s)]
*  Is it possible? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2400.2999999999997s)]
*  I spend every waking hour preparing for a return. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2402.5s)]
*  It will happen. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2409.18s)]
*  I've borrowed a stone from the airport. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2411.06s)]
*  I need to return. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2414.06s)]
*  Since our story first aired, Sola has continued to bring new Afghan students from around the [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2417.3s)]
*  world to Rwanda and is developing an online academy called Sola X. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2423.46s)]
*  And in June, Shabana spoke to the UN Security Council, urging the world not to look away [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2430.2599999999998s)]
*  from the plight of Afghan girls. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2436.46s)]
*  One atrocity in Vladimir Putin's unprovoked war in Ukraine is largely hidden. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2448.38s)]
*  The torture of prisoners. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2454.42s)]
*  We met three former POWs, survivors, in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2456.94s)]
*  They were soldiers and all women. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2463.2200000000003s)]
*  What they say is extremely disturbing. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2466.62s)]
*  Their stories can't be verified independently, but they track with the testimony that the [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2469.3s)]
*  UN collected from more than 150 former prisoners. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2474.86s)]
*  At the end of a vicious battle, fear of Russian captivity was so great that one of the women [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2480.2400000000002s)]
*  we met simply looked to God and said, please, let me die. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2486.42s)]
*  They fought here, in the southern port city of Mariupol. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2493.82s)]
*  Once alive with 400,000 residents, Putin shelled Mariupol to misery. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2499.02s)]
*  In April, the last Ukrainian troops were cornered in those steel mills above the graveyard. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2506.02s)]
*  Tell me about the fight at the steel plant. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2513.66s)]
*  35-year-old Sergeant Irina Stoney is a medic. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2517.7s)]
*  We saw people dying, children dying, children's heads being blown off, civilians. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2525.02s)]
*  It's hard to bring those memories back. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2534.62s)]
*  We were scared because at least 25,000 civilians were killed. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2539.14s)]
*  She continued, we tried to help civilians, we tried to give them some assistance, at [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2545.14s)]
*  least something, water, medicine, food. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2550.42s)]
*  There were little children with us. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2555.66s)]
*  It's hard to watch your friend's head be blown off in front of you. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2558.3399999999997s)]
*  It was, you can't describe this with words, difficult, very difficult when people you [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2565.46s)]
*  know and children die for nothing. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2572.2200000000003s)]
*  Sergeant Stoney served in Mariupol with Captain Mariana Mamonova, a 31-year-old military doctor. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2580.86s)]
*  He told us, there was one time when we saw a family running as we were driving to save [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2590.94s)]
*  our soldiers and when we were coming back, the father was crying over his family, the [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2596.14s)]
*  bodies of the mom and a little child. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2603.94s)]
*  Also at the steel mill, 33-year-old Sergeant Anastasia Chornenka ran communications. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2608.18s)]
*  The fight there was desperate. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2615.46s)]
*  Yes, constant aviation, artillery, this was non-stop fighting, non-stop shelling. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2618.58s)]
*  During the battle, Chornenka often sent her family a text, just one character. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2627.8199999999997s)]
*  She said, it was very quick, if you sent a plus sign, it meant you were alive. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2637.02s)]
*  Dr. Mamonova also had a message, it should have been for her husband back home, but she [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2646.06s)]
*  would not send it. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2652.18s)]
*  When did you realize that you were pregnant? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2654.62s)]
*  I realized that I was pregnant in the middle of March and when I saw that the test result [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2664.18s)]
*  was positive, I cried, I was hysterical, but she didn't want her husband to know how much [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2672.54s)]
*  he stood to lose. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2680.02s)]
*  I knew if I died, it would be easier for him to reconcile with the loss of a wife than [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2683.34s)]
*  the loss of a wife and baby. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2689.54s)]
*  By April, the fight for Mariupol was hopeless. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2693.7799999999997s)]
*  Sergeant Stoney's unit was surrounded. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2698.02s)]
*  They took away our men separately, splitting them up. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2702.9s)]
*  Some of the men were beaten, some of our men were, how shall I put it, shot in the head. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2705.58s)]
*  The Russians killed unarmed men? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2714.94s)]
*  Yes, we were unarmed. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2718.22s)]
*  About the same time, Captain Mamonova's unit was moving in the night to reinforce troops [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2721.88s)]
*  fighting for their lives. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2728.12s)]
*  She told us, I would just say to my soldiers in my medical unit that if I was going to [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2731.4599999999996s)]
*  get captured, just shoot me. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2735.9399999999996s)]
*  Don't look at me, just shoot me. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2739.5s)]
*  And don't let me be captive. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2745.8999999999996s)]
*  Don't let me. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2748.98s)]
*  Suddenly, in our interview, she was back, hiding in the rear of a truck that ran into [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2750.7799999999997s)]
*  a Russian patrol. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2758.02s)]
*  She turned to a fellow soldier. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2759.98s)]
*  Please tell me that we did not get captured. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2764.1s)]
*  And he's looking at me, not knowing what to say. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2769.06s)]
*  I see fear in his eyes. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2774.42s)]
*  I realize that he can't tell me that we didn't get captured because we did get captured. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2777.34s)]
*  Next came a blinding light and voices warning that they would be shot. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2785.3799999999997s)]
*  Artillery shells were falling down, and at that moment I was asking God to let me die. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2795.02s)]
*  I thought, oh God, I don't want to be captured. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2801.8199999999997s)]
*  I just want to die here. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2805.54s)]
*  Please let me die. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2808.5s)]
*  She knew that the walls of Putin's prisons muffled cries of torture. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2812.78s)]
*  A UN POW investigation collected testimony of executions, starvation, attacks by dogs, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2818.78s)]
*  twisting joints until they break, and mock executions. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2826.94s)]
*  When they first talked about taking me for execution, Anastasia Chorninka told us, I [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2833.38s)]
*  only had enough time to pray and say goodbye to my children. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2841.34s)]
*  Probably the worst you feel is that you won't see your children ever again. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2846.5s)]
*  All her children knew was that the plus sign text stopped lighting up the phone. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2853.1000000000004s)]
*  You don't know where the fighting is and whether your children are in a safe place. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2860.5800000000004s)]
*  This is the most frightening thing for a mother. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2865.5800000000004s)]
*  After Putin's unprovoked invasion, the UN POW report also found Russians abused by Ukraine, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2869.98s)]
*  mostly during capture. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2879.86s)]
*  But Ukraine has opened its POW camp to international inspection while Russia hides its penal colonies. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2882.18s)]
*  Irina Stoney says that she was moved among four Russian prisons and tortured with electricity. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2891.62s)]
*  They would rape some men. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2899.54s)]
*  When we were in Tehanro prison, there was a cell for men and a cell for women, and we [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2902.22s)]
*  could hear our men screaming when they were being raped. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2907.92s)]
*  They were making our men scrape off their tattoos. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2912.5s)]
*  They were beating them badly. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2917.38s)]
*  They did the same to women. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2919.38s)]
*  They would beat them, pour boiling water on them. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2920.9s)]
*  The only thing they didn't do, they didn't rape women. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2926.66s)]
*  But the beating was brutal. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2931.58s)]
*  Abuse was very bad. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2933.5s)]
*  This is a Russian propaganda film in April that shows Mariana Mamanova in captivity. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2937.2599999999998s)]
*  She's about four months pregnant and was told privately what would become of her baby. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2945.22s)]
*  They said they would take my child away from me, and they would move the baby repeatedly [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2952.14s)]
*  from one orphanage to another so I could never find my child. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2957.3399999999997s)]
*  I wonder, as you felt your daughter moving, what did you tell her? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2962.74s)]
*  I was saying to my child that we were strong and we could do it. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2970.74s)]
*  Your mommy is strong. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2974.74s)]
*  Your mommy is military. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2976.58s)]
*  Your mommy is a doctor. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2978.74s)]
*  Your mommy will save you. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2980.9s)]
*  She asked only one thing from her child in return. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2984.2200000000003s)]
*  You will be born in Ukraine. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2988.9s)]
*  Can you hear me in there? [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2991.34s)]
*  You must be born in a free Ukraine. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2994.34s)]
*  Unknown to the prisoners, a free Ukraine was working to get them home. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=2998.82s)]
*  Andrei Yermak is chief of staff to President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3004.6600000000003s)]
*  From the very first day, Yermak told us, President Zelensky set up the job to return prisoners [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3009.62s)]
*  of war. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3018.46s)]
*  Leading negotiations for prisoner exchanges is Yermak's job. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3020.54s)]
*  So far, his team has negotiated 38 POW swaps, trades of about equal numbers. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3025.62s)]
*  1,800 Ukrainians have been freed. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3033.94s)]
*  An estimated 4,000 or so remain. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3036.9s)]
*  What is your commitment to the POWs who are still being held by Russia? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3041.02s)]
*  They should hold on and remember that your country will never forget you. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3048.3s)]
*  We will do everything to get you released. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3053.54s)]
*  Have strength and faith in our ability to return everyone home. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3057.46s)]
*  There was fresh faith in his work in October with a deal to free 108 Ukrainians at once, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3063.78s)]
*  all of them women. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3072.3s)]
*  Irina Stoney was among them, hooded, tied and told nothing. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3074.86s)]
*  We had been transported in vehicles and by plane so many times before, and we thought [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3081.1800000000003s)]
*  they were just taking us to another cell. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3086.92s)]
*  Anastasia Chorninka was also in the dark. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3090.2200000000003s)]
*  She had duct tape over her eyes, so her first inkling was something she could feel. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3093.62s)]
*  They put us on quite comfortable buses which were never used, and we thought something's [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3102.54s)]
*  not right, something's up, because the bus felt comfortable and soft. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3108.7s)]
*  Later, the tape was cut from her eyes. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3115.18s)]
*  And you realize that there is no guard behind you, and you stand there looking at the big [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3119.68s)]
*  sign that reads Ukraine. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3126.16s)]
*  I understand that you got a new tattoo after you were released. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3130.0s)]
*  May I see it? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3135.3199999999997s)]
*  It reads, they were trying to kill me, they captured me, but I didn't give in, because [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3137.44s)]
*  I was born Ukrainian. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3144.48s)]
*  Another Ukrainian birth was delayed just enough. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3148.28s)]
*  This is Dr. Mariana Mamanova walking to freedom. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3154.1200000000003s)]
*  She told us, near the end of her captivity, one kind Russian officer sent her to a hospital, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3158.5600000000004s)]
*  and weeks later, she was in a prisoner exchange. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3166.6000000000004s)]
*  How long was it from that moment of liberation until your daughter was born? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3170.28s)]
*  Four days. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3178.76s)]
*  I was liberated on the 21st of September, and my child was born on the 25th. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3180.5600000000004s)]
*  A healthy girl named Anna. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3187.2000000000003s)]
*  So she did exactly what you asked her to do, not be born until you were out of there? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3190.8s)]
*  Yes, I was stroking my bump, and I said, okay, we're home now, and you can be born. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3196.6000000000004s)]
*  Everything is good. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3204.32s)]
*  We are home. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3205.48s)]
*  No one knows freedom like those who have lost it. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3207.88s)]
*  The women we spoke to were held six months. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3212.2400000000002s)]
*  Anastasia Chorninka retired from the military. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3216.0800000000004s)]
*  Sergeant Irina Stoney is on duty near the front, and Captain Mariana Mamanova has maternity [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3219.84s)]
*  leave before she returns to the fight for Ukrainian freedom, and now freedom's future. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3228.0s)]
*  Imagine your teenage daughter was kidnapped while studying for her exams at school, and [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3237.8s)]
*  not just your daughter, but hundreds of girls in your town taken in the night. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3249.6000000000004s)]
*  The families of Chibok, Nigeria lived through that nightmare almost five years ago when [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3255.1200000000003s)]
*  the Islamic terrorist group Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates to Western education [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3260.6000000000004s)]
*  is forbidden, attacked a local school and ran off with 276 girls. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3267.28s)]
*  Some escaped, but it took the Nigerian government three years to negotiate the release of fewer [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3274.0s)]
*  than half of them. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3280.28s)]
*  Since their release, the Chibok girls, as they're known, have been largely hidden from the public, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3282.36s)]
*  but we were able to meet with them at a kind of prep school to hear the remarkable story [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3288.4s)]
*  of survival. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3293.92s)]
*  This is a hostage video released by Boko Haram from their hideout in the Sambiza forest one [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3297.32s)]
*  month after the kidnapping. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3303.1200000000003s)]
*  The Chibok girls are all covered, chanting verses from the Koran. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3305.4s)]
*  They were facing a life of misery with beatings and starvation. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3311.2000000000003s)]
*  But now, at the new foundation school on the campus of the American University of Nigeria, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3318.84s)]
*  the girls are singing again. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3324.88s)]
*  This time, it's the Christian songs they grew up with. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3328.6400000000003s)]
*  We are the Chibok girls that have been in captivity, and now we are alive. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3334.2000000000003s)]
*  Getting out alive and singing hymns, things Rebecca feared might never happen. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3340.84s)]
*  Did they let you sing when you were in captivity? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3347.0s)]
*  No, we are singing in private. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3349.32s)]
*  They won't allow us to sing like that. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3354.2799999999997s)]
*  So they whisper sing? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3357.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3359.56s)]
*  For Rebecca and her friends, just singing out loud today is a gift after their three [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3360.56s)]
*  years of living in fear and pressure to become Muslims. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3366.08s)]
*  So if you didn't convert to Islam, were you punished for not converting? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3371.2s)]
*  Yes, they say if you didn't convert to Islam, you wouldn't get home alive. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3378.7599999999998s)]
*  That's what they say. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3385.92s)]
*  Here are some of the girls two years ago, right after they were released, alive, but [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3388.3599999999997s)]
*  looking like concentration camp survivors, haunted and numb. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3394.12s)]
*  This is Rebecca, skin and bones. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3399.8799999999997s)]
*  I heard you were eating grass. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3403.24s)]
*  Yeah, some of us eat that. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3405.2s)]
*  And we are just be patient and leave later. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3408.56s)]
*  No food, no anything. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3413.8399999999997s)]
*  Look at them today, in their 20s. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3416.8399999999997s)]
*  They're healthy and full of spirit at a school created just for them, paid for by the Nigerian [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3420.2799999999997s)]
*  government and some donors, where they are making up for lost time. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3426.56s)]
*  They are from Northern Nigeria, where life can be hard and opportunities for women are [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3433.32s)]
*  limited. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3438.28s)]
*  Now in their Wi-Fi equipped dorms, they have smartphones and laptops and their own beds. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3440.0800000000004s)]
*  They go back to Chibok to see their parents twice a year, over Christmas and during the [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3448.76s)]
*  summer. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3454.32s)]
*  What we call high blood pressure. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3455.32s)]
*  Otherwise, they work hard here, going to class six days a week, studying subjects like biology [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3457.36s)]
*  and math, working toward getting into the university, which would for them be free of [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3464.0s)]
*  charge. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3469.76s)]
*  Most of the girls we spoke to were shy and reticent as they told us that their tight [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3472.76s)]
*  bond going back to Chibok helped them survive. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3478.2000000000003s)]
*  When Grace's leg was injured the night of the kidnapping, her sisters, as she calls [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3483.1600000000003s)]

*  They are taking care of me. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3493.1200000000003s)]
*  They are washing water, they are washing me, my clothes and everything. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3495.1200000000003s)]
*  We are worried about her leg. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3500.1200000000003s)]
*  We don't have anybody there that will take care of her, only us. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3502.1200000000003s)]
*  You helped each other, sick or unhappy or scared. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3507.1200000000003s)]
*  You were a unit. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3512.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3513.48s)]
*  They just had an unbelievable bond and an attachment to each other. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3514.48s)]
*  Somiari Dem is the girls' therapist on call 24-7. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3521.48s)]
*  Born in Nigeria, raised and educated in the States, she has been with this group since [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3527.48s)]
*  they arrived over a year ago. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3533.48s)]
*  Can you tell us what their experiences were like generally? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3536.12s)]
*  Just a lot of the stuff, the starvation. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3539.2799999999997s)]
*  They ate grass? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3541.44s)]
*  Eating grass, exactly. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3542.44s)]
*  The beatings, these things, being forced to get married. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3544.44s)]
*  At some point in time, the bomb, the airstrikes. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3550.44s)]
*  These are some of the things that were reoccurring events. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3553.44s)]
*  For three years? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3558.44s)]
*  For three years, yeah. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3559.44s)]
*  You were actually hit. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3560.44s)]
*  The airstrikes started as the Nigerian government pursued and attacked Boko Haram. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3562.44s)]
*  A bomb dropped where you were being held. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3568.6s)]
*  They mistakenly threw the bomb. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3571.6s)]
*  And you were injured? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3574.6s)]
*  With some particles. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3575.6s)]
*  Shrapnel. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3577.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3578.6s)]
*  And it's still inside my body. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3579.6s)]
*  It has not been removed. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3581.6s)]
*  Because the shrapnel is in her liver. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3584.6s)]
*  She is in pain, but she perseveres at school. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3587.6s)]
*  You were kidnapped because you went to school. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3591.6s)]
*  Now you're back in school. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3594.6s)]
*  Do you feel like you're doing something courageous? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3596.7599999999998s)]
*  Even what happened with me will not stop me doing what I already designed in my mind. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3599.7599999999998s)]
*  Reginald Braggs, an American, has also been at the new Foundation school since its start. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3607.7599999999998s)]
*  Getting ready for midterm? [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3612.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3614.7599999999998s)]
*  A former naval officer turned college administrator, Braggs runs the school and designed the educational program. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3615.7599999999998s)]
*  What is the biggest challenge for you in this program? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3623.92s)]
*  You know, it really is trying to help the students to meet their goal of getting into the university. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3626.92s)]
*  And part of that challenge is their English language proficiency. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3632.92s)]
*  So I had this idea, I said, what would an old-fashioned American spelling be with these guys? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3637.92s)]
*  R-N-G. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3642.92s)]
*  O-R-A-N-G-E. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3643.92s)]
*  Correct. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3646.92s)]
*  Sometimes one of them struggles over even an easy word like poor. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3648.08s)]
*  I know you. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3655.08s)]
*  Poor. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3656.08s)]
*  B-U-T. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3657.08s)]
*  No. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3660.08s)]
*  And is embarrassed. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3661.08s)]
*  But when someone like Rebecca gets a hard word right... [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3664.08s)]
*  Assembly. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3668.08s)]
*  A-S-S-E-M-B-L-Y. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3669.08s)]
*  Correct. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3672.08s)]
*  A roar goes up. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3673.08s)]
*  It's amazing how their confidence grows after this. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3675.24s)]
*  You've seen a progression. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3678.24s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3680.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3681.24s)]
*  But do you think there's a lot of pressure on them in the spelling bee? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3682.24s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3686.24s)]
*  That's okay? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3687.24s)]
*  Of course. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3688.24s)]
*  Correct. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3689.24s)]
*  This is about education for them and knowing that they can do something. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3690.24s)]
*  And it's always better when you have someone who is confident and they're doing something [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3693.24s)]
*  and the other students are observing them. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3698.24s)]
*  If they can do it, you can do it. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3701.24s)]
*  S-C-E-B-T. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3703.3999999999996s)]
*  No. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3706.3999999999996s)]
*  It's not as easy as having a can-do attitude for these girls, says Dem. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3707.3999999999996s)]
*  She thinks they're being pushed too hard and that the curriculum is too rigorous. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3713.3999999999996s)]
*  I think at times we need to kind of scale it back. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3718.3999999999996s)]
*  Trauma really changes the brains, whether memory, cognition, recall, retrieval. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3721.3999999999996s)]
*  We have to meet them where they are. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3729.3999999999996s)]
*  If not, all we're doing is making the situation worse. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3731.56s)]
*  We were told they still get flashbacks and night terrors. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3736.56s)]
*  And it doesn't help that over 100 of their friends are still missing. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3741.56s)]
*  Do you think about the ones who are still in captivity? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3745.56s)]
*  When I think about them, I'm crying. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3748.56s)]
*  And I know that place. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3751.56s)]
*  I know the condition. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3753.56s)]
*  I don't want my sisters to stay there. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3754.56s)]
*  I want them to come out. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3757.72s)]
*  Taking away any negative thoughts. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3760.72s)]
*  Dem is using an array of therapeutic treatments to help them heal. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3763.72s)]
*  Inhale. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3768.72s)]
*  She leaves them in yoga and relaxation exercises and provides individual and group therapy [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3769.72s)]
*  where most of the girls have had difficulty talking about the suffering they endured. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3776.72s)]
*  Can you tell us just a little bit about what life was like in captivity? [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3781.8799999999997s)]
*  Is it too hard to talk about? [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3788.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because I don't want to remember some things when I try maybe I will feel like crying [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3793.8799999999997s)]
*  like that. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3802.8799999999997s)]
*  But her sisters share her memories. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3806.04s)]
*  The idea here is that the trauma happened in a group, so it's good to do the healing [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3811.04s)]
*  in a group. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3817.04s)]
*  If you have any pain in your body, this white line... [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3818.04s)]
*  Dem says she never pushes the girls to open up. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3821.04s)]
*  So, for instance, she doesn't know how many were raped. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3824.04s)]
*  But she says there's a fine line between rape and forced marriage. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3828.04s)]
*  You got married? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3833.04s)]
*  You got married. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3834.2s)]
*  Mariam wasn't forced to convert. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3836.2s)]
*  She was already Muslim. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3838.2s)]
*  So she was quickly married off to a Boko Haram commander and got pregnant. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3840.2s)]
*  You gave birth there in the forest. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3845.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3848.2s)]
*  She said the birth was difficult, but her son Ali was healthy. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3849.2s)]
*  After two years, her Boko Haram husband actually helped her and Ali escape. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3853.2s)]
*  Do you feel still that you're married? [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3860.2s)]
*  No. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3863.3599999999997s)]
*  And Ali? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3864.3599999999997s)]
*  Now two-and-a-half? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3865.3599999999997s)]
*  Where is he? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3866.3599999999997s)]
*  He's in Chibok with his grandparents. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3867.3599999999997s)]
*  The new foundation school decided babies wouldn't be allowed on campus. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3870.3599999999997s)]
*  Would you like it if they let you have the baby here? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3875.3599999999997s)]
*  Yes, I like it. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3878.3599999999997s)]
*  But, you know, it can't be possible to carry Ali here. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3880.3599999999997s)]
*  What does he call you? [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3884.3599999999997s)]
*  Mariam. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3886.3599999999997s)]
*  She's been separated from her son for so long, he doesn't recognize her as his mother. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3887.3599999999997s)]
*  As a child of Boko Haram, Ali is likely to face difficult odds. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3892.52s)]
*  But Mariam feels that with a good education, she can ease the way for him. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3897.52s)]
*  The Nigerian government is paying for most of their schooling. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3903.52s)]
*  But thousands of other women and girls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram are languishing [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3907.52s)]
*  with other victims in government-run camps like this one we found just 30 minutes from [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3912.52s)]
*  the school. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3918.52s)]
*  OK. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3919.52s)]
*  The contrast with the Chibok girls at the new foundation school is glaring. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3920.68s)]
*  But their free education comes with the burden of great expectations. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3925.68s)]
*  The school's walls are plastered with sayings like, there's no limit to what I can achieve. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3930.68s)]
*  Their dorms are named after successful women like Michelle Obama and Malala. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3937.68s)]
*  Do you feel that because you're getting this wonderful education free, you're not going [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3942.68s)]
*  to feel that you need to give something back to your country? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3949.8399999999997s)]
*  If I work hard and if I become something, it's not only this Nigeria, I will help many [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3954.8399999999997s)]
*  countries. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3964.8399999999997s)]
*  You'll be like Malala. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3965.8399999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3966.8399999999997s)]
*  Maybe I will do more than her. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3967.8399999999997s)]
*  When I think about it... [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3970.8399999999997s)]
*  Don Dekel, president of the American University of Nigeria, says the new foundation school [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3973.8399999999997s)]
*  is grooming these young women to give back by becoming leaders. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3979.16s)]
*  The best revenge is massive success. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3984.3199999999997s)]
*  And I really think these young women are going to be some senators, some governors. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3986.6s)]
*  Some of these young women want to join the military. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3990.56s)]
*  They told me they want to be a general in the military and go get Boko Haram, so they [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3992.3199999999997s)]
*  can't do this to any other young girls. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3995.8399999999997s)]
*  It is ironic that their worst experience has led to opportunities beyond their wildest [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=3997.48s)]
*  dreams. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=4004.0s)]
*  They're not completely healed, but every day they get stronger physically, mentally, emotionally, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=4005.84s)]
*  and they spell better. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=4014.36s)]
*  S-O-N-D-I-E-N. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=4017.36s)]
*  Despite everything that they've been through, they push forward, they come back, even with [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=4022.36s)]
*  greater force, with greater determination, and they blow me away. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=4029.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlPhJHZrHk&t=4035.0s)]
