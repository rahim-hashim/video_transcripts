**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [February 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4)
*  global trade has been severely disrupted in the Red Sea [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=0.0s)]
*  by a dangerous militia in Yemen who the U.S. Navy is trying to stop. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=12.0s)]
*  When was the last time that the U.S. Navy operated at this pace for a couple months? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=18.0s)]
*  I think you'd have to go back to World War II where you have ships who are [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=24.88s)]
*  engaged in combat. When I say engaged in combat, where they're getting shot at, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=29.28s)]
*  we're getting shot at and we're shooting back. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=33.44s)]
*  Ah, beautiful kids, Andrew. Good, good. I'm gonna blame you, Andrew, if they don't do it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=40.32s)]
*  Can you imagine the repercussions on myself, my family, if it was me, Andrew Hitt, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=45.92s)]
*  who prevented Donald Trump from winning Wisconsin? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=53.28s)]
*  You're saying you were scared. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=56.24s)]
*  It was not a safe time. If my lawyer is right and the whole reason Trump loses Wisconsin is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=58.0s)]
*  because of me, I would be scared to death. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=65.84s)]
*  Five thousand miles from Hollywood, Oppenheimer star Killian Murphy prefers a beach to a red [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  carpet, but his Oscar nomination brings a blinding light to an artist who'd rather disappear. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=79.2s)]
*  Emily Blunt told me, half joking, your interview with Killian will be a disaster. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  Is this going to be a disaster? I don't, I hope not. I'll find out. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. I'm Bill Whitaker. I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=104.0s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. I'm John Wertheim. I'm Cecilia Vega. I'm Nora O'Donnell. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=108.08s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=113.44s)]
*  After Hamas launched its deadly terrorist attack in Israel this past October, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=126.32s)]
*  and Israel began its unrelenting war in Gaza in response, President Biden warned Iran and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=131.2s)]
*  its proxies in the Middle East to stay out of it. One of those groups decided instead that it was [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=136.8s)]
*  all in. That group is a Shia militia from Yemen known as the Houthis. Yemen is the poorest country [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  in the Middle East, but it's 1200 miles of coastline leads in and out of the Suez Canal, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=149.36s)]
*  the primary route by sea between Europe and Asia, responsible for a trillion dollars a year in global [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=155.44s)]
*  trade. So when the Houthis began to attack commercial ships in solidarity with Hamas, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=162.08s)]
*  President Biden faced a crisis in the Red Sea and sent the U.S. Navy into its first major fight [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  of the 21st century. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=174.72000000000003s)]
*  Our report begins not on the water but in the air. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=180.56s)]
*  Where from a U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane 500 feet above the Red Sea, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=183.84s)]
*  we were the first journalists to see the types of commercial ships the Houthis have targeted [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=191.84s)]
*  and the U.S. warships sent to protect them. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=196.96s)]
*  Vice Admiral Brad Cooper is the U.S. military's deputy commander in the Middle East. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=206.8s)]
*  After October 7th, as the Navy's top officer in the region, he ordered the 5th fleet into an area [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=211.36s)]
*  it typically sailed right through. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=217.52s)]
*  The Red Sea is about the size of California, in the north, the Suez Canal, in the south, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=241.36s)]
*  the 20-mile wide strait known in Arabic as the Bab el-Mandeb, or in English, as the Gate of Grief. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  It was near there three months ago that a Japanese chartered ship built to carry cars [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  was hijacked by the Houthis, who posted this video. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=269.76s)]
*  Since then, according to the Pentagon, the Houthis have attacked at least 45 ships, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=273.84s)]
*  and the U.S. Navy has shot down more than 95 drones and missiles fired by the militia [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=279.12s)]
*  that controls one-third of Yemen, including the capital Sana'a. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=285.2s)]
*  As Houthi attacks intensified in December and January, the world's largest container ship [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=290.08s)]
*  companies all made the decision to avoid the Suez and go around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=295.76s)]
*  adding as much as a month of travel time and a million dollars in fuel. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=302.8s)]
*  U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told 60 Minutes two weeks ago [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  the diversions pose a risk to the global economy, and in the near term, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=313.12s)]
*  That's going to affect Europe much more than it's going to affect us. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  Tesla and Volvo were both forced to suspend some European production last month due to supply chain [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  disruptions. There are still ships going through the Suez, mostly smaller regional carriers, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=328.32s)]
*  that are willing to run the current risks of the Red Sea. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  How much is that, in terms of that traffic, has it been reduced by half? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=338.64s)]
*  It's been reduced on any given day, sometimes 40 percent, but it's clearly flowing, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=342.8s)]
*  and I think in many respects it's flowing because of the defensive umbrella that we put over the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  southern Red Sea for sure. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=352.08s)]
*  The official name of that defensive umbrella is Operation Prosperity Guardian. It's a coalition [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  of more than 20 nations that includes the United Kingdom, but most of the ships, aircraft and fire [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=364.16s)]
*  power are coming from America. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=370.88s)]
*  When was the last time that the USAV operated in this pace for a couple months? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=377.68s)]
*  I think you'd have to go back to World War II where you have ships who are engaged in combat. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=384.56s)]
*  When I say engaged in combat, where they're getting shot at, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=390.08s)]
*  we're getting shot at, and we're shooting back. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=393.12s)]
*  Initially, the Houthis, backed by Iran, stated they would only shoot at ships linked to Israel [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=395.6s)]
*  in support of the Palestinian people and to force a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=403.92s)]
*  Their ultimate political aims, as well as their actual aim, appears to be less precise. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=410.48s)]
*  They have fired at ships tied to dozens of nations. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=416.32s)]
*  Most Africa and most Israel! [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  The Houthis' official motto is God is great, death to America, death to Israel, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=422.72s)]
*  a curse upon the Jews, victory to Islam. While their slogan may not be new, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=428.8s)]
*  their weapons and tactics are, according to Admiral Cooper. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=435.76s)]
*  The Houthis are the first entity in the history of the world to use anti-ship ballistic missiles [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=440.48s)]
*  ever firing against shipping. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  No one has ever used it? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  No one has ever used an anti-ship ballistic missile, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=448.8s)]
*  certainly against commercial shipping, much less against U.S. Navy ships. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=451.6s)]
*  Admiral Cooper took us inside the Fifth Fleet's command center at Naval headquarters in Bahrain. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=455.92s)]
*  I think there's a sense that the Houthis are sort of like a ragtag kind of terrorist group. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=462.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That can be a sense and it'll be a false sense and we would be [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=466.64s)]
*  unwise to consider that. You know, 10 years of being supplied [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=471.12s)]
*  by the Iranians, very sophisticated advanced weapons. They have hit a few ships. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  Of those targets, how many of them are directed at U.S. Naval assets? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=480.79999999999995s)]
*  The overwhelming majority over these last couple months have been directed at [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=484.96s)]
*  internationally flagged merchant ships. A small percentage of them are directly at U.S. Navy ships. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  What kind of damage would one of those anti-ship ballistic missiles do on a commercial ship? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=494.4s)]
*  Well, let's go right here. This is exactly what it looks like. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=498.88s)]
*  The Houthis attacked it and you can see in practical terms what the damage was. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=501.28s)]
*  The Houthis also have inexpensive Iranian-designed attack drones in their arsenal, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=507.2s)]
*  like the 15-foot wide Samad, with a range of up to 1,100 miles. Some of their anti-ship ballistic [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=512.64s)]
*  missiles resemble the Iranian weapons seen here and can hit targets up to about 300 miles away. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=520.0799999999999s)]
*  If there is an anti-ship ballistic missile launch, this ballistic missile travels at about Mach 5, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=527.6s)]
*  about 3,000 miles an hour. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=532.24s)]
*  How much time is there between a Houthi launch and then it could breach a U.S. ship? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=534.0s)]
*  If it's coming toward them, now just put yourself in the seat of the destroyer captain on that ship. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=540.32s)]
*  He has about 9 to 15 seconds to make a decision if they're going to shoot that down. It's intense. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=544.48s)]
*  To speak to one of those destroyer captains deployed in the southern Red Sea, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=551.28s)]
*  we took a five-mile helicopter ride from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower over to the USS Mason, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=555.76s)]
*  where we met Commander Justin Smith. The destroyer is one of four American warships in the area [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=564.96s)]
*  that have shot down more than a dozen of the Houthis' anti-ship ballistic missiles. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=571.36s)]
*  How quickly can you see those? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=576.88s)]
*  Anywhere from one to two minutes out and providing me that decision space. To give me the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=579.2s)]
*  9 to 15 seconds as the captain of this ship on what my actions are going to be. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=584.32s)]
*  You made it sound like that's a lot of time, 9 to 15 seconds. It doesn't sound like much. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  Seems very small and very short in duration, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=593.84s)]
*  but my crew has that ready proficiency to be able to engage. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=596.6400000000001s)]
*  We learned that so far in this crisis, the Navy has fired about a hundred of their standard surface [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=602.72s)]
*  to air missiles that can cost as much as $4 million each. The decision to fire one at an [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=608.56s)]
*  incoming Houthi missile or kamikaze attack drone is made in the ship's Combat Information Center, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=616.4s)]
*  or CIC. We can be attacked at any time, in any place. That's where Commander Smith showed us [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=622.56s)]
*  a video of the USS Mason doing just that. We're seeing an intercept here followed by a quick [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=630.16s)]
*  explosion showing a successful engagement. The weapon systems that you have on board here, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=635.52s)]
*  and specifically the standard missiles, those are expensive weapons and you're using them to shoot [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=642.24s)]
*  down $10,000 drones. Is that worth it? I don't think you could put a price tag on safety and [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=647.52s)]
*  the defense of our sailors on board. You have to be right 100% of the time. They just have to get [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=656.4s)]
*  right once. A day before our visit to the USS Mason, about a hundred miles away, another US [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=662.64s)]

*  Gonna win this day, we gotta win it. But Trump didn't win in Wisconsin. He lost to Joe Biden [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=999.92s)]
*  by some 20,700 votes. The Trump campaign appealed, challenging more than 200,000 absentee ballots [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1005.44s)]
*  on technical grounds in two Democratic counties. If you count the lawful votes, Trump won Wisconsin [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1013.68s)]
*  by a good margin. That was false. What he said was false. The Trump campaign won the votes in [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1020.7199999999999s)]
*  Dane County and Milwaukee County toss. Did you support that idea? It wasn't something that I was [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1025.36s)]
*  comfortable with. Dane County and Milwaukee County in Wisconsin are the most liberal counties. The [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1031.04s)]
*  majority of the black population in Wisconsin live in those two counties. Correct. Correct. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1037.04s)]
*  Personally, you did not believe all those absentee ballots should be thrown out. Well, I voted that [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1042.08s)]

*  Republican electors? That made you suspicious? It did. I was already concerned that they were [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1074.88s)]
*  going to try to say that the Democratic electors were not proper in Wisconsin because of fraud. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1081.8400000000001s)]

*  Republican electors on December 14th at the Capitol and, as a contingency, signed a document [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1106.56s)]

*  the legal arguments that the Trump team is making actually win in court. Right. And I remember asking, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1119.12s)]
*  how can this be that a court overturns the election and just because we don't meet and [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1126.96s)]
*  fill out this paperwork on the 14th that Trump would forfeit Wisconsin? And the legal analysis [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1132.0s)]
*  back was the statute's very clear. The electors have to meet at noon at the Capitol in Wisconsin [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1140.24s)]
*  on December 14th. That morning, the state Supreme Court in a four-three ruling rejected the Trump [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1146.48s)]
*  campaign's attempt to throw out more than 200,000 votes. But Andrew Hitt says he and the other [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1152.48s)]
*  Republican electors met anyway to cast fake votes because he'd been told the Trump campaign [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1158.72s)]
*  would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Kenneth Chesbrough, a pro-Trump attorney who was an alleged [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1164.72s)]
*  architect of the fake electors plan, showed up to watch. We got specific advice from our lawyers [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1170.88s)]

*  could overturn a 4-3 decision. To get the paperwork to Washington, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1409.1999999999998s)]
*  they picked Alicia Gunther, then a 23-year-old law school student working part-time for Wisconsin's [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1415.04s)]
*  Republican Party. I was on break from law school and wanted to make some extra money to pay for [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1421.12s)]
*  books and worked for the party for my month off of school. So on January 4, I got a call from the [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1427.1999999999998s)]
*  executive director of the Republican Party of Wisconsin since I was helping out at the time. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1432.8s)]
*  What did you think when you got the text? At first, I didn't know what it was. And then [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1436.6399999999999s)]
*  he followed up and asked that the Trump campaign wanted these papers flown out to D.C. because they [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1439.52s)]
*  had gotten lost in the mail. Gunther says she picked up the papers here at the state party [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1445.28s)]
*  headquarters and on January 5 flew to Washington. So this is the email. She showed us her email [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1450.6399999999999s)]
*  chain with Ken Chesbrough and the Trump campaign senior advisor, Mike Roman. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1456.48s)]
*  Explaining that I should only give the documents to Ken Chesbrough. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1460.96s)]
*  So and then they asked me to meet up with him outside the Trump hotel. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1464.32s)]
*  I mean it sounds very secretive. Yeah, I thought that that email was pretty odd and dramatic. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1469.1200000000001s)]
*  And you knew what was happening on January 6 in terms of the the certification of the vote. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1474.48s)]
*  I don't know if I was very tuned into that truly because I thought that a court of law would have [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1479.28s)]
*  needed to overturn the election for those documents to be used. Did you know what Chesbrough [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1485.04s)]
*  looked like? So he had actually sent me a selfie. He sent you a selfie? Yes. So that you would know [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1490.32s)]
*  it was him? Yeah. Can I see it? Yeah. She still has the photo saved on her phone. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1494.6399999999999s)]
*  It's Ken Chesbrough. What did he say to you? He kind of took a dramatic step back and looked at me [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1501.2s)]
*  and said you might have just made history. Ken Chesbrough told investigators he delivered [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1506.72s)]
*  the Wisconsin documents to Capitol Hill. The next day on January 6 he can be seen in videos [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1512.32s)]
*  outside the Capitol near conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. And I want to look even more deeply [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1518.88s)]
*  at the fake electors scheme. According to the January 6 select committee an aid to Wisconsin [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1525.92s)]
*  Senator Ron Johnson tried to arrange to get the fake electors slates to Vice President Pence. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1531.44s)]
*  And I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so because if Mike Pence does [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1537.6000000000001s)]
*  the right thing we win the election. But Pence's aid refused texting do not give that to him [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1543.92s)]
*  according to the committee. When the Senate chamber had to be evacuated [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1550.96s)]
*  the real electoral votes in these boxes were taken to safety. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1557.68s)]
*  And when Congress resumed they were returned into the House chamber. Pursuant to Senate concurrent [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1562.24s)]
*  Vice President Pence announced the election results and closed the session at 3 44 a.m. January 7th. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1568.56s)]
*  The Supreme Court ultimately declined to hear the Trump campaign's lawsuit in Wisconsin. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1579.12s)]
*  What do you think about Donald Trump continuing to claim that the 2020 election was stolen? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1584.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean it wasn't stolen. It wasn't stolen in Wisconsin. This past December Andrew Hitt and [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1589.52s)]
*  Wisconsin's other Republican electors settled a civil lawsuit against them by some of the [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1595.52s)]
*  state's Democratic electors. They admitted they signed a document that was used as part of an [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1600.96s)]
*  attempt to improperly overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Hitt resigned as chairman of the [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1606.56s)]
*  Wisconsin Republican Party in August 2021. He's cooperated with the January 6 committee. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1613.68s)]
*  Using our electors in ways that we weren't told about and we wouldn't have supported. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1619.84s)]
*  And he says he's also cooperated with federal prosecutors. He maintains he and the other fake [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1626.24s)]
*  electors in Wisconsin were tricked. Whenever anybody sees our text messages, our emails, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1632.3999999999999s)]
*  our documents, they understand, they know, their conclusion is we were tricked. The January 6 [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1639.6799999999998s)]
*  committee saw it. Jack Smith specifically in his indictment refers to some of the electors were [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1647.04s)]
*  tricked. That was us. The former president is known to watch 60 Minutes. If he's watching, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1654.08s)]
*  what would you want to say to him? I would say that this country needs to move forward. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1659.68s)]
*  That we need a leader who is, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1665.12s)]
*  tackles serious problems and serious issues that this country faces. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1670.32s)]
*  And we need faith in our institutions again. And the next president of the United States needs to [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1674.4s)]
*  do that. And in your opinion, that's not him. It is not him. Correct. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1682.64s)]
*  Real electors in Michigan on their fake counterparts. They were going to try to sneak in the night before. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1692.48s)]
*  Sneak in the night before and sleep in the Capitol. At 60minutesovertime.com. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1698.24s)]
*  2023 was the year the world learned to pronounce Killion. The ancient Irish name seemed to be on [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1712.96s)]
*  everyone's lips as the film Oppenheimer became a blockbuster with 13 Oscar nominations, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1720.48s)]
*  including best actor for Killian Murphy. Murphy has worked nonstop for nearly 30 years, but it was [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1728.08s)]
*  the epic drama of the atomic bomb that ignited a star. In this moment, with a golden globe under [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1735.44s)]
*  his pork pie hat and the Oscars three weeks away, Murphy is more famous than well known. So we [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1742.8s)]
*  set out to learn more. We were warned the 47 year old Irishman is reserved and wouldn't talk [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1750.24s)]
*  about himself. But we discovered finding Killian Murphy depends on where you look. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1756.16s)]
*  Ireland's Dingle Peninsula was named for a goddess before such things were written. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1762.8s)]
*  And for 6,000 years, stories have passed by ear. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1767.76s)]
*  So if verse inhabits every Irish soul, then in a country pub, Killian Murphy is among peers, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1793.2s)]
*  as he would have it. Just a man with a pint to lift and no fame to bear. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1802.1599999999999s)]
*  What is the meaning of Ireland to you? I don't think I can answer that question satisfactorily. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1809.76s)]
*  It's defined who I am as a person and my values. It's just home. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1816.96s)]
*  Home includes his wife of 20 years, two teenage sons, and Scout, a lab named for the character in [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1826.56s)]
*  To Kill a Mockingbird that figures Murphy has always let stories lead his path. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1834.96s)]
*  You find so much empathy in novels, you know, because there you are putting yourself into [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1842.72s)]
*  somebody else's point of view. And I've always been a big reader. When a movie can connect with [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1848.4s)]
*  someone and they feel seen or feel heard, or a novel can change somebody's life, or a piece of [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1854.3200000000002s)]
*  music, an album can change someone's life. And I've had all that happen to me. And that's the [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1860.3200000000002s)]
*  power of good art, I think. There's a straight line from the music in the pub to Oppenheimer. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1865.28s)]
*  I think they're from the same source. I mean, I really do. I don't see, I see it's all in a [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1872.48s)]
*  continuum. You know what I mean? It's just a form of expression. Expression in the eyes of J. Robert [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1877.44s)]
*  Oppenheimer, the physicist who created the atom bomb, but never controlled it. If they detonated [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1883.68s)]
*  too high in the air, the blast wouldn't be as powerful. With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1890.4s)]
*  we'll take it from here. I remember reading at the beginning about him that he was more riddled [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1895.2s)]
*  than answer. And I thought, oh, okay, wow. That's, that's interesting. I'm curious about your notes. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1904.3200000000002s)]
*  The Riddle was in this script by writer-director Christopher Nolan, printed in red so it couldn't [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1911.76s)]
*  be photocopied. I did genuinely think it's one of the greatest screenplays I'd ever read. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1919.2s)]
*  And you told him, I'll do it. I mean, I said I'd do it before I read it. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1923.6000000000001s)]
*  I always say that. That's quite a risk. Why would you do that? It's always paid off for me, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1928.0s)]
*  you know, in every film that I've worked with him on. I'm not going back. I'm not going back. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1932.0s)]
*  There have been six Chris Nolan films for Murphy, Dunkirk, Inception, and three Batman titles. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1939.1200000000001s)]
*  Would you like to see my mask? You told me that getting a film made and getting it seen is a [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1950.16s)]
*  miracle. It is. And then if it's anyway good, that's a miracle. And then if it connects with [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1956.48s)]
*  audiences, that's a miracle. So it's a miracle upon miracle upon miracle to have a film like [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1962.72s)]
*  Oppenheimer. It really is. His Oppenheimer was not so much a miracle as hard work. He lost 28 pounds [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1967.04s)]
*  to get the silhouette. Then he rose to the character step by step over six months, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1977.04s)]
*  reading, listening to Oppenheimer's lectures, and covering miles on the beach, performing for Scout. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1984.48s)]
*  I remember at one point I said to Chris, Chris, there appears to be, he appears to speak Dutch [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1993.28s)]
*  here. And I think he's giving a lecture in Dutch here. What are we going to do about that? And [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=1998.8799999999999s)]
*  Chris said, you mean, what are you going to do about that? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2002.6399999999999s)]
*  What's he saying? Murphy says he put all he learned in the back of his mind and acted on [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2007.04s)]
*  instinct. I think instinct is your most powerful tool that you have as an actor. Nothing must be [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2019.84s)]
*  predetermined. So therefore you mustn't have a plan about how you're going to play stuff. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2026.56s)]
*  And I love that. It's like being buffeted by the wind and being buffeted by emotion. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2031.04s)]
*  You don't get to commit the sin. And then I was all feel sorry for you. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2035.28s)]
*  Emily Blunt plays Oppenheimer's tormented wife. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2040.8s)]
*  He's very visceral to be in a scene with. It's like you, he transports you. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2049.44s)]
*  He'll kidnap you in a scene. My favorite acting moment of his in Oppenheimer is the scene [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2053.36s)]
*  after the bomb has been dropped and he's addressing all of the people at Los Alamos. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2060.64s)]
*  The world will remember this day. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2066.48s)]
*  He somehow welds together the concept of being proud of what they did and regretting it very [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2073.44s)]
*  deeply. Yes, yes. All at the same time. I know. It's too soon to, it's too soon to determine. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2082.16s)]
*  What the results of the bombing are. But I'll bet the Japanese didn't like it. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2090.0s)]
*  No one moment is about one thing. And if you're as agile as someone like Killian and is vulnerable [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2099.6s)]
*  and is clever, you can play it all. But I don't know if many people can do what he does. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2106.4s)]
*  Killian Murphy discovered agility in his hometown Cork. His mother was a teacher, his father, a school inspector. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2113.6s)]
*  In high school, Murphy and his brother had a band. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2123.68s)]
*  Performing led to acting class and his first play. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2129.28s)]
*  This is more like the size of a storage room than a theater. Yeah, but that's all we were used to. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2133.6s)]
*  His first theater, 1996, age 20, the play was Disco Pigs, which grew to bigger theaters and became a movie. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2139.7599999999998s)]
*  Why did you think you could be an actor? I didn't. I was very comfortable on stage in front of an [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2149.44s)]
*  audience from when I was little. I never had any nerves doing that. I felt that natural, you know, and thrilling. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2155.44s)]
*  In this theater, what did you learn about acting? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2164.64s)]
*  There's a fire escape door right there and that's a kind of an alleyway there and so you get a lot of [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2169.6s)]
*  like drunk guys out of their mind bashing up against the fire escape door and it used to kind [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2175.8399999999997s)]
*  of energize us. So I remember learning about like taking whatever you have, sort of responding to [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2182.0s)]
*  whatever the energy is in the room and using it. That's really good training. Yeah. Maintaining [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2189.12s)]
*  your character with the drunk guy yelling through the fire escape door. Yeah, yeah, and I think [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2195.2799999999997s)]
*  theater is such an absurd undertaking when you think of it, you know, because at any point it [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2202.24s)]
*  could collapse and go wrong. It's dangerous. Yeah, and I love that aspect of it. That love led him to [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2208.48s)]
*  drop law school and since then there have been a dozen plays and 40 movies. I love it when it [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2215.04s)]
*  becomes an immersive experience. I love getting lost in it. In the early days that was with theater, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2223.12s)]
*  it felt kind of extraordinary that with just the power of will and a couple of lights and a good [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2231.84s)]
*  script we were creating this world. So that's kind of addictive when it works well. It worked well [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2237.92s)]
*  in 2013 in a breakout role as a leading man. In the series Peaky Blinders, Murphy plays Thomas [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2244.8s)]
*  Shelby who survives World War I to lead a family of gangsters. You're mostly in the war so you know [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2253.6800000000003s)]
*  the battle plans always change and get up. Well, here it is. They're all damaged, broken men, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2261.28s)]
*  but something got knocked in him and he came back with this incredible drive and ambition and [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2269.7599999999998s)]
*  like I'm not afraid of death so now I can do whatever I want. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2276.08s)]
*  In Tommy Shelby you created a sympathetic, relatable monster. Kill and kill. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2284.16s)]
*  Tell me why it's my people listen. I like to be challenged and I when I read something I want to [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2293.92s)]
*  go I don't really know how I can do that. In 10 years of Peaky Blinders, Murphy came into his own. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2302.96s)]
*  I heard very early on in my career a director, it was one of the Sidneys, it couldn't be in Sydney [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2311.6s)]
*  no matter, it could be in Sydney Pollock, but one of them said it takes 30 years to make an actor. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2316.48s)]
*  It's not just technique and experience and all that, it's maturing as a human being and [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2322.32s)]
*  trying to grapple with life and figure it out and all of that stuff so by the time [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2331.2000000000003s)]
*  you've been doing it for 30 years you've all of that banked hopefully [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2337.76s)]
*  and eventually then I think you'll get to a point where you might be an okay actor. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2342.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2347.44s)]
*  Maturing is the theme of Murphy's next film based on the novel Small Things Like These. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2350.32s)]
*  He plays Bill Furlong tormented by injustice. His wife fears his empathy will upend their lives. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2358.0800000000004s)]
*  Don't you ever question this. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2369.76s)]
*  If you want to get on in this life, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2377.28s)]
*  there are things you have to ignore. That's Eileen Walsh. No actor has known Murphy longer. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2385.76s)]
*  She was his first partner in Disco Pigs 28 years ago. Is his work ethic rooted in fear or joy? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2393.36s)]
*  Oh that's a good question. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2404.4s)]
*  I think it can only be joy but it sometimes takes a lot of pain to get to that joy. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2408.48s)]
*  The deeper we go with acting, the cost is greater for us and physically I know Oppenheimer [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2415.04s)]
*  has cast him for the weight loss he insisted and it was his choice to do but then it was [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2424.08s)]
*  the right choice to create that amazing silhouette. But from the very beginning, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2432.24s)]
*  our warm-ups for Disco Pigs involved us punching each other quite hard [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2437.44s)]
*  and like going for it and then bursting out into it. This huge ball of velocity coming into it [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2446.64s)]
*  was the beginning of an Oppenheimer, was the whole kind of atom of us. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2455.84s)]
*  Now after three decades of work, Killian Murphy is cast in the most familiar Irish legend of all. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2465.44s)]
*  Maybe there is gold, a 24-karat gold-plated statue at the end of his spectrum of talent. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2475.6000000000004s)]
*  You have screwed this up though, you know. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2483.84s)]
*  In what way? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2486.16s)]
*  You used to be an actor. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2487.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2489.52s)]
*  And now you're a movie star. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2490.0s)]
*  Okay. Am I? I think you could be both. You know I've never understood that term really, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2491.52s)]
*  movie star. I've always just felt like I'm an actor. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2500.56s)]
*  That's I think a term for other people rather than for me. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2504.24s)]
*  The Last Minute of 60 Minutes is sponsored by UnitedHealthcare. There for what matters. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2513.2s)]

*  opponent. The report says he collapsed after taking a walk at his Arctic prison colony. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2530.08s)]
*  We spoke with him a little over three years ago in Berlin. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2537.2s)]
*  Where he was recovering from poisoning from a chemical weapon ordered, he told us, by President [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2540.72s)]
*  Putin. I think for Putin, why he's using this chemical weapon to do both. Kill me and, you know, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2546.8799999999997s)]
*  terrify others. It's something really scary and Putin is enjoying it. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2557.4399999999996s)]
*  You have said you think that Mr. Putin's responsible. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2562.9599999999996s)]
*  Think that Mr. Putin's responsible. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2567.12s)]
*  I don't think I'm sure that he's responsible. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2570.0s)]
*  Navalny returned to Russia to face trial, imprisonment, and near certain death. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2573.84s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2t2IpBmW4&t=2580.7200000000003s)]
