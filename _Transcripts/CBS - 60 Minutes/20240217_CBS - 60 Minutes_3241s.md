# Alexey Navalny and Putin's history of suspected poisonings and crackdowns | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [February 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY)
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin's political opposition has taken to the streets once again [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=0.0s)]
*  in cities across the country. They were ignited by the imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=18.72s)]
*  Navalny, who was said to be near death in the prison infirmary, partly the result of a 24-day [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=24.88s)]
*  hunger strike, which he ended Friday. Last month, President Biden announced new sanctions against [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=32.08s)]
*  Russia for incarcerating Navalny, who has become an international symbol of freedom in an increasingly [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=38.96s)]
*  autocratic country. Navalny was taken into custody as he returned to Russia in January, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=46.32s)]
*  after treatment in Germany for a near-fatal poisoning. We spoke last fall in Berlin as he [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=53.68s)]
*  recovered, and as we reported then, he told us he was aboard a flight from Siberia to Moscow [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=60.88s)]
*  when he began to feel very sick. I said to the flight attendant, and I kind of shocked him [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=68.4s)]
*  with my statement, well, I was poisoned and I'm going to die, and I immediately lay down under [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=75.12s)]
*  his feet. Alexei Navalny was on a flight to Moscow from Siberia, where he'd been campaigning [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=81.36s)]
*  against Putin's party in a local election when he collapsed with no pain, but knowing he was dying. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=87.6s)]
*  Actually, every cell of your body just telling you that's body, we are done. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  One of the other passengers turned on his phone and captured Navalny moaning in anguish. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=101.12s)]
*  The pilot made an emergency landing in Omsk, where medics, thinking Navalny must be a drug [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=106.8s)]
*  addict, administered the usual treatment for an overdose and rushed him to a local hospital, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  where they said he wasn't poisoned, but wouldn't let him leave for days. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=120.08s)]
*  Well, it was a big fight, and they thought that after 48 hours, these [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=125.12s)]
*  these poison would be untraceable, and they just keep me there until these 48 hours will be gone. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=131.28s)]
*  Navalny is under constant surveillance. His wife, Yulia, says government agents were at the hospital [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=140.56s)]
*  controlling access to her husband, and she believes, calling the shots. At the time, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=147.04s)]
*  Navalny was in a coma, unaware that his wife, Yulia, was waging a public campaign to encourage [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  Western diplomatic pressure and did you write a letter to Putin? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=160.16s)]
*  Yeah, I did it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=164.64s)]
*  Dear Mr. Putin, free my husband. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=165.92s)]
*  I wrote like, I insist that he should do it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=168.16s)]
*  I demand you free my husband. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=172.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=174.56s)]
*  It was an online campaign, let him out. And Putin thought it would be safe for him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=175.04s)]
*  Just let me out after 48 hours. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  So, after 48 hours, the Russian government allowed him to be flown by air ambulance [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=184.24s)]
*  to a hospital in Berlin known for its experience with victims of poison attacks. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=190.56s)]
*  And I gather they suspected poison right away? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=196.16s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, his team in Siberia searched his hotel room, collecting things Navalny may have touched, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=201.68s)]
*  like this water bottle, which the doctors in Berlin sent along with a blood sample [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=208.08s)]
*  to a German military lab to see exactly what the poison was. And the answer was Novichok. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=213.2s)]
*  They discovered Novichok, this nerve agent, in my blood, inside of body, on my body, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=221.04s)]
*  and all this bottle from the hotel. So, that's why we now we know that I was poisoned in the hotel, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=227.6s)]
*  because I, well, it's again, it's just a pure speculation, because no one knows what happened [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=234.88s)]
*  exactly. But I think that when I was maybe put some clothes with this poison on me, I touch it [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=241.92s)]
*  with the hand and then I seep from the bottle. So, this nerve agent was not inside of a bottle, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=250.32s)]
*  but on the bottle. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  Novichok is a highly toxic nerve agent said to be 10 times more potent than sarin gas. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=257.52s)]
*  Labs in France and Sweden corroborated the finding. There's no doubt it was military grade Novichok. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=264.08s)]
*  Maybe it's the most toxic agents invented by the humans. So, it's a new type of Novichok, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  which prove that unfortunately, Putin have a developing new program of these chemical weapon, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=280.56s)]
*  which is forbidden. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  The Russians have said that they destroyed all these chemical weapons. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=288.16s)]
*  That's why actually they deny everything, because it means that they still have this Novichok. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=292.24s)]
*  So, it means they're not just violating with the keeping it, they are continue to improve it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=298.32s)]
*  And there's no doubt that Russia is the only place that where that could have come from. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=304.64s)]
*  This is absolutely correct. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=309.44s)]
*  It's a banned substance. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=311.36s)]
*  It's a banned substance. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=313.12s)]
*  I think for Putin, why he's using this chemical weapon to do both, kill me and, you know, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=314.56s)]
*  I don't think I'm sure that he's responsible. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=324.0s)]
*  Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says the charge is completely baseless and unacceptable. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=348.32s)]
*  But Angela Merkel of Germany and Emmanuel Macron of France [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=354.88s)]
*  have persuaded the European Union to impose sanctions over this. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, all these leaders have signed on except Donald Trump. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes, I have noticed it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  Is it important to you that he condemn this action? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=371.28s)]
*  So, I think it's extremely important that everyone, of course, including and maybe in [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=375.44s)]
*  the first row president of United States to be very against using chemical weapon in the 21st century. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=384.48s)]
*  But why would Putin want to poison Alexei Navalny? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=392.96s)]
*  When we first met Navalny three years ago, he was running against Putin for president. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=396.8s)]
*  He had made a name for himself by getting his hands on incriminating [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  internal financial documents related to high-level officials and posting them on a blog. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=405.91999999999996s)]
*  Did these documents that you got prove corruption? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=412.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. I work as a whistleblower, and I'm not afraid to announce the names. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  He says he found that the Kremlin's inner circle was accumulating vast amounts of wealth [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=421.52s)]
*  and published pictures of multiple homes and yachts. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  He moved on to airing documentaries on YouTube with video of the official's lavish lifestyle. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=430.56s)]
*  And it's something very special about Mr. Putin, that he's crazy about money, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=437.36s)]
*  personal money, about his family being rich, his friends, like all his people who served with him [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=444.56s)]
*  in the KGB, all of them, they are billionaires. That's why fighting corruption means for him [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=452.4s)]
*  that he's fighting me. You know, I'm smiling because here you are. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=458.64s)]
*  You have survived the most potent nerve agent there is, and you are as fiery and worked up about [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=463.76s)]
*  your about Putin and what's going on in this country as you were when I met you a couple [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=471.84s)]
*  of years ago. Well, I'm glad. I'm glad that I survived. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=476.64s)]
*  His blog inflamed so much outrage in 2017 that tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=481.84s)]
*  against Putin. When Navalny called for a second round of protests three months later, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=489.2s)]
*  he was arrested before he even left his apartment building. He's been jailed so many times, he's [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=494.64s)]
*  lost count. He's been beaten, had green dye with acid splashed in his face. And now he can add [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  poisoning to his resume and blame President Putin. How can you say that? Why wouldn't it be one of [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=508.96s)]
*  the oligarchs whom you've embarrassed by, as you say, exposing their corruption? Even for oligarch, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=515.12s)]
*  it's impossible to get this Novichok. It's not something you can buy in the store, even if you [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  have a millions of billions of dollars. Maybe more important, you cannot use it. You will kill [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=526.64s)]
*  yourself and everyone around because it's very difficult to, you know, contain it. Yes. And then [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=532.64s)]
*  this huge cover-up operation, there is no criminal investigation so far. If Putin is not responsible, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=540.88s)]
*  why there is no investigation? And look what they're doing right now. Like Putin with the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=547.6s)]
*  conversation with the French President Macron, he said, well, Navalny poisoned himself. Seriously. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=554.8s)]
*  Mr. Putin told the president of France that you poisoned yourself. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=561.6s)]
*  Yes. It was just to annoy him. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=565.84s)]
*  Putin is contending with rounds of protests in the far eastern part of the country, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=569.52s)]
*  with people taking to the streets for the past three months. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  Navalny thinks the attempt on his life is connected. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=578.32s)]
*  Despite his controlling police, judges, courts, media and everything, still he's like, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=581.6800000000001s)]
*  he understand that he's surrounded by protests and it's increasing. So that's why he's, they decided [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=589.5999999999999s)]
*  to, you know, export extreme measures. This is what he looked like just a month ago, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=595.76s)]
*  soon after his doctors brought him out of an induced coma, rail thin with a sickly pallor. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=602.48s)]
*  This photo was taken the first day he saw his children after being taken off a ventilator. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=609.52s)]
*  So you were in a coma and then you woke up and what happened? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=615.6s)]
*  After this coma, I just jumped to the long period of kind of crazy hallucinations and several, you [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  know, steps of realizing where I am, who I am. And I could not speak and I could not write. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=629.12s)]
*  How has this affected your family? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=638.64s)]
*  Well, it was a difficult situation, but they stand it and... [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=641.6s)]
*  Including your children? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=645.84s)]
*  Including children. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=647.84s)]
*  Your son is 12 and your daughter is in college. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=648.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=651.4399999999999s)]
*  Those are tough ages to realize that your father came close to being assassinated. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=652.96s)]
*  Did they say to you, Pop, Dad, you have to stop? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  Absolutely not. No, absolutely not. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=663.68s)]
*  I am very lucky man because I have all support from my family. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=668.16s)]
*  You'd almost have to at this point. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=672.64s)]
*  Navalny, his wife, his bodyguard and I went out for a walk in front of the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=675.36s)]
*  Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and a phalanx of police showed up. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=680.24s)]
*  So you certainly travel with a lot of protection. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=684.48s)]
*  Yes, I have a lot of security. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=688.8s)]
*  He's under the protection of the German government because there's concern he could be the target of [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=690.56s)]
*  another poisoning. And yet he said he's determined to return to Moscow in a couple of months as soon [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=696.24s)]
*  as he's 100 percent and resume his work where he left off campaigning against Vladimir Putin. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=702.88s)]
*  You know, you used to be known as the man who had no fear. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=710.48s)]
*  But what about your family? Do you ever think that you are putting them in danger? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=714.5600000000001s)]
*  That is the toughest part. Yes, I don't feel any fear. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=720.32s)]
*  But children, what is kind of really horrible thought if they will try to use this Novichok [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=725.84s)]
*  somewhere around my apartment where my children is coming like, you know, this door or something, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=732.72s)]
*  but everyone can touch it. But anyway, we should fight these people because they will never stop. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=739.76s)]
*  They will poison someone else. They will poison more people. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=746.56s)]
*  Well, how do you feel now? Are you back? Totally back? You seem to be. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=750.16s)]
*  I still need some time to recover and I'm working on it. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=755.5999999999999s)]
*  But you do go to rehab. Do you go every day? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=760.0799999999999s)]
*  Yes. To learn from the scratch how to move, how to do some things. They're interesting that [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=762.7199999999999s)]
*  I feel kind of a bit of wooden or a tin man like from the Wizard of Oz, because the body [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=770.24s)]
*  lost all flexibility at all. Interesting how it's worked. I have no idea. Now it's difficult [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=778.56s)]
*  movies for me, for example, pick something from the ground. What about the psychological effect [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  of having knowing that somebody tried to kill you came that close? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=792.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, I think it's a good thing. It's very useful for politicians maybe facing that [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=799.76s)]
*  once because it's changed you a bit. So maybe ironically, I became kind of more human after [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=808.48s)]
*  these facing deaths. The Biden administration's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=815.76s)]
*  on CNN last Sunday, warned the Kremlin of consequences if Alexei Navalny dies in custody. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=822.4799999999999s)]
*  A lot's been said about Russia meddling in our 2016 presidential campaign, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=839.4399999999999s)]
*  but the Russians are already buzzing about their presidential election next March, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=845.04s)]
*  because unexpectedly, Vladimir Putin has a genuine challenger, a handsome 41-year-old lawyer, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=849.92s)]
*  Alexei Navalny, who has chosen one of the most dangerous occupations in the world, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=856.7199999999999s)]
*  running against the man who controls the Kremlin. The election process in Russia is tightly managed [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=862.64s)]
*  by the government, but Navalny has been drawing big crowds to his protests and rallies all over [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=868.88s)]
*  the country, where he laces into Putin with no holes barred. Putin is a thief and the head of [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=874.56s)]
*  the entire corrupt system. This is one brave man, not only because he has taken on the all-powerful [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=883.68s)]
*  Vladimir Putin head on, but because he's been holding rallies, many of them without official [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=890.7199999999999s)]
*  permits, which has had its consequences, one arrest after another. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=897.28s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=902.24s)]
*  During my campaign, I spent every fifth day in the jail, so now I'm kind of, you know, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=904.0s)]
*  used to it. Nothing new for me. It became a routine of my life. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=910.56s)]
*  You got out of prison just a couple of days ago. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=913.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=916.64s)]
*  You held a rally right away, and you're goading them. You're begging them to arrest you again. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=917.04s)]
*  These are people who are trying to steal my country, and I strongly disagree with it. I'm [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=924.72s)]
*  not going to be, you know, a kind of speechless person right now. I'm not going to keep silent. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=930.88s)]
*  You're not allowed to run. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=937.12s)]
*  I'm not allowed to run, and they put enormous pressure on our headquarter and on our volunteers. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=938.24s)]
*  My chief of campaign got out of jail just yesterday, so all these [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=945.5200000000001s)]
*  facts show us that he's really afraid not of me, but these people who are standing behind me. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=953.36s)]
*  We have now 170,000 volunteers. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=961.12s)]
*  Mr. Putin remains highly popular. It's all but a foregone conclusion that he'll be reelected. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=965.9200000000001s)]
*  And yet the Kremlin is doing everything it can to make it difficult for Navalny to gain traction. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=972.4s)]
*  For instance, the government says he can't be on the ballot because he was found guilty of [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=978.64s)]
*  embezzlement in what Navalny insists was a trumped-up charge, and he's barred from national [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=983.68s)]
*  television. But he's managed to get around that by reaching an ever-widening audience on social [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=989.84s)]
*  media channels and YouTube, where he has millions of followers and says he's raised almost four [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=996.16s)]
*  million dollars from ordinary Russians. What do you think the biggest issue is for most people [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1002.32s)]
*  here in Russia? Poverty and inequality, huge in Russia, even compared to the United States, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1009.84s)]
*  the European country. No opportunities at all, no future for the people. Putin is stealing their [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1016.5600000000001s)]
*  future, and Mr. Putin puts his relatives, his closest friends, his colleagues from the KGB, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1023.5200000000001s)]
*  at the chiefs of this company. And that's why they're controlling the whole economy. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1032.0s)]
*  Navalny began his public life 10 years ago in a shrewd way. He bought small shares of [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1038.0s)]
*  state-owned companies. As a shareholder, he was able to get his hands on internal financial [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1044.8799999999999s)]
*  documents, investigated evidence of misconduct, and posted it all on a blog. Did these [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1050.56s)]
*  documents that you got prove corruption? Absolutely. I work as a whistleblower, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1058.0s)]
*  and I'm not afraid to announce the names. He says he found that the Kremlin's inner circle was [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1063.12s)]
*  accumulating vast amounts of wealth and published pictures of multiple homes and yachts. He moved on [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1069.6s)]
*  to airing documentaries on YouTube with video of the officials' lavish lifestyle. How did you get [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1076.64s)]
*  the footage? Now we have our air force. We're just using drones. You sent drones up? Yes, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1083.68s)]
*  we do a lot of work with the drones because for us it's the best way to show this way of life. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1091.3600000000001s)]
*  When you publish this footage of the yachts, of these palaces, of this real estate, and you [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1099.1200000000001s)]
*  can show documents, look, this guy have a relatively modest salary, but look at this house. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1108.24s)]
*  His most watched documentary, with over 25 million views, focused on Prime Minister [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1115.4399999999998s)]
*  Dmitry Medvedev and his estates. Navalny says all five of them. The video inflamed so much [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1121.1999999999998s)]
*  outrage that in March, tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1129.6s)]
*  When Navalny called for a second round of protests three months later, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1134.3200000000002s)]
*  he was arrested before he even left his apartment building. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1139.6000000000001s)]
*  But his supporters came out in droves all across the country. And like Navalny, close to 1,700 were [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1143.68s)]
*  arrested. These were the first protests of this magnitude in Russia in six years. Back then, in [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1151.3600000000001s)]
*  2011, roughly 60,000 went to the streets in a burst of anti-Putin dissent. That's when Navalny [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1159.92s)]
*  debuted in Moscow as an opposition leader. As we were watching in the United States, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1168.48s)]
*  I think there was the impression that public opinion was going to force change here. It [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1174.4s)]
*  looked that way on television, but that is not what happened. Mr. Putin realized that [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1181.04s)]
*  his, it's not affordable for his system to give people more democracy. That's why in the [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1188.16s)]
*  2012, he completely changed his strategy and start to arrest people, start to fabricate [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1195.3600000000001s)]
*  criminal cases. Look, in the start of the 2011, I was a respectful lawyer. At the end of the 2012, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1202.64s)]
*  I was several time convict. But now he's seen as the last man standing since most of the other [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1212.16s)]
*  opposition leaders either fled the country or were found dead under mysterious circumstances. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1219.52s)]
*  Why are you still alive? This is a favorite question of my wife. I don't know. Maybe they [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1226.3200000000002s)]
*  missed the good timing for it when I was less famous. Do you feel that your visibility with [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1233.1200000000001s)]
*  so many people knowing who you are, that that's protecting you? Well, actually, I'm trying not to [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1241.04s)]
*  thinking about it a lot because if you start to think what kind of risk I have, you cannot do [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1248.8799999999999s)]
*  anything. Navalny's platform includes more spending on education and health, restoring a free press [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1257.36s)]
*  and taxing the oligarchs. In the West, he's assumed to be a Russian liberal. But there was a time when [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1267.6s)]
*  he marched with nationalists, some of them fascists, something he's tried to downplay lately. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1274.9599999999998s)]
*  You have attended nationalist, what we would call right wing rallies, I believe in support of [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1281.28s)]
*  ethnic purity, Russian ethnic purity. Have you supported that? Of course not. I was part [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1289.4399999999998s)]
*  of these rallies because I support the freedom of rallies because I support freedom for meetings. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1297.36s)]
*  They're supporters of yours. They're part of your following. A lot of them supports me and they [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1304.9599999999998s)]
*  recognize me as a leader. When he was growing up, he came from a committed communist family in a small [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1309.9199999999998s)]
*  town south of Moscow. What was your childhood like? I'm 41 years old. It means that actually I'm a guy [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1316.1599999999999s)]
*  from the Soviet Union. I was a young pioneer. I had my red tie. My father was in the military [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1324.64s)]
*  and I was very proud that my father is guarding Mother Russia from evil Americans with their [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1333.1200000000001s)]
*  bombs and missiles. Actually my biggest memory at that time as a child standing in line, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1339.2800000000002s)]
*  standing in line maybe sometimes for hours to just buy milk. He was close to his brother Oleg, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1346.16s)]
*  seven years younger. So it was painful for him when three years ago the government, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1353.52s)]
*  to get him to stop his activism he believes, convicted him and Oleg of embezzlement, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1359.04s)]
*  a ruling the European Court of Human Rights called arbitrary and unfair. To make matters worse, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1365.44s)]
*  he got a suspended sentence, but Oleg is still behind bars. He's still in prison and he spent [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1373.04s)]
*  two years in the solitary confinement which is actually in Russian condition is torturing. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1380.72s)]
*  You think he's in jail to get you to stop? Yes, absolutely. But he hasn't stopped, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1386.48s)]
*  even though he's been physically attacked. While campaigning in Siberia, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1394.08s)]
*  he was splashed in the face with green dye. It was painful but I could... It hurt. It hurt. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1398.88s)]
*  But he handled it with humor saying he was Shrek. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1406.32s)]
*  His followers dyed their own faces green and posted photos to Instagram and Twitter in solidarity. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1411.9199999999998s)]
*  Then he was splashed again. Second time was much more painful. There was acid [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1419.6s)]
*  as I understand it. My doctor in the hospital said, well, Alexei, you should be prepared that you will [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1426.72s)]
*  be blind for one eye. And so I even start to think about kind of, you know, I will be such [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1433.2s)]
*  kind of pirate with a patch. The Kremlin did allow him to travel to Spain for specialized surgery, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1440.16s)]
*  but immediately after the treatment, he returned to Moscow and went right out campaigning again. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1449.28s)]
*  Lately, he's been concentrating on rural areas, holding rallies far from the big cities [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1456.56s)]
*  in places like Siberia and the Urals. I'm traveling every weekend to spend Friday, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1462.32s)]
*  Saturday and Sunday in the region to have these rallies. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1468.1599999999999s)]
*  On our last day there, we went with him to the mid-sized industrial city of Ivanovo, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1472.0s)]
*  four hours outside Moscow, starting with a train ride. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1477.76s)]
*  Mr. Putin never ever mentioned your name. May criticize you, but never your name. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1481.84s)]
*  What do you make of that? I have no idea what they're doing. Maybe it's the kind of same thing. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1488.96s)]
*  Superstitious for them. Like, you know, you cannot name the animal because if you name it in the [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1494.24s)]
*  night, it will come and eat you or something like this. And they have a lot of nicknames and [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1500.88s)]
*  euphemism for me, like this gentleman, this guy, this convict and this convict. But they are thinking [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1505.8400000000001s)]
*  about me and believe me, they are afraid of me, afraid of us. So that is much more important for [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1515.2s)]
*  us than mentioning my name. It was snowing and dark out when we got to a wooded lot on the edge [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1522.32s)]
*  of town where a big crowd of mostly young Russians was waiting. No one thinks he has much of a chance [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1529.1200000000001s)]
*  of beating Putin in the election. But still, Putin fears him, Navalny says, because of his ability to [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1536.16s)]
*  draw crowds at rallies and into the streets. He perseveres knowing what he's doing is dangerous. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1542.88s)]
*  His supporters have been roughed up by police and pro Kremlin activists who Navalny calls thugs. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1553.92s)]
*  Is it in your mind worth your life? Because there is a big target on you, no question. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1562.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm trying not to think about it because look, I think I'm ready to sacrifice everything [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1570.08s)]
*  for my job and for the people who are surrounding me. I'm not letting them down. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1579.28s)]
*  And I'm trying not to reflect about it all the time. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1583.76s)]
*  Questions continue to surround the role Russia may have played in President Trump's election last fall [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1587.68s)]
*  and about the president's professed admiration for Vladimir Putin's skills as a strong leader. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1605.6000000000001s)]
*  What the president doesn't talk about is the unfortunate fate that stalks some of Putin's [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1611.8400000000001s)]
*  most prominent critics. They have been victims of unsolved shootings, suspicious suicides, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1617.12s)]
*  and poisonings. Tonight, the story of one of them. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1623.36s)]
*  Vladimir Karamurza was an opposition activist on the front lines, protesting Putin's policies, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1630.8s)]
*  organizing demonstrations, and town hall meetings. He knew he was on a dangerous mission. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1637.84s)]
*  When we met him last year, he told us that one day in May 2015, he learned just how dangerous. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1644.24s)]
*  I was in a work meeting with my colleagues in Moscow when I suddenly started to feel [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1651.9199999999998s)]
*  really sick. And I went within about 20 minutes from feeling completely normal to feeling like a [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1657.1999999999998s)]
*  very sick man. And I don't remember anything for the next month. You were out for a month? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1661.84s)]
*  I was in a coma for a week, and I don't remember anything for a month and had basically a cascade [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1666.08s)]
*  of all my major life organs failing one after another, just switching off, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1670.72s)]
*  you know, the lungs, the heart, the kidneys. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1674.24s)]
*  He was shuttled from hospital to hospital in Moscow for two days [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1676.24s)]
*  as doctors frantically tried to figure out what was wrong with him. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1680.4s)]
*  I was at one point connected, I think, to eight [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1684.24s)]
*  different artificial life support machines. And doctors told my wife that it's only going to be [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1687.28s)]
*  about 5 percent chance that I'll survive. But he beat the odds. When we spoke with him last year, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1690.96s)]
*  he'd been recovering for a year, but he was still walking with a limp from nerve damage. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1697.68s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1703.44s)]
*  Well, it was some kind of a very strong toxin. We don't know what it was, because, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1704.48s)]
*  you know, with these things, as people who know more about this than I do explain to me, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1708.5600000000002s)]
*  you basically have to know exactly what you're testing for in order to find it. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1712.5600000000002s)]
*  So they never found the exact compound? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1716.0s)]
*  They never did. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1717.92s)]
*  It wasn't until the fourth day and after he'd been on a dialysis machine that blood was drawn [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1718.88s)]
*  and sent to a toxicology lab in France. It found heavy metals in his blood, but no specific toxin. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1725.12s)]
*  Still, Kara Mirza maintains that he was poisoned. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1733.12s)]
*  I have absolutely no doubt that this was a deliberate poisoning, that it was intended to kill. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1736.9599999999998s)]
*  Because, as I mentioned already, the doctors told my wife that it's about a 5 percent chance [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1743.04s)]
*  of survival. And when it's that kind of percentage, it's not to scare, it's to kill. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  Can you be sure that what happened to you was directed by Mr. Putin? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1750.4799999999998s)]
*  Well, of that, I have no idea. I don't know the precise circumstances. I don't know the who or [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1755.28s)]
*  the how, but I do know why. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1758.9599999999998s)]
*  In recent years, quite a few of Putin's enemies have perished by swallowing things they shouldn't [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1764.3999999999999s)]
*  have. In 2006, Russian spy turned Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko drank tea laced with polonium [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1770.56s)]
*  210. Two years earlier, the Ukrainian politician Viktor Yushchenko had somehow ingested dioxin. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1779.36s)]
*  He survived, but was disfigured. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1787.28s)]
*  But what would the motive be in the case of the critic Vladimir Kara Mirza? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1790.56s)]
*  Cambridge educated he was for years a Washington-based reporter for a Russian TV station. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1795.36s)]
*  So he was well-connected and had perfect English, which he used to incessantly criticize the regime [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1801.84s)]
*  on the international stage. A government that is based on genuine support [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1809.04s)]
*  does not need to jail its opponents. As if his outspokenness wasn't enough to anger the Kremlin, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1813.36s)]
*  he made matters worse for himself when he joined forces with this man. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1819.28s)]
*  It's death if you cross the Putin regime. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1823.68s)]
*  Bill Browder was for years the largest foreign investor in Russia and Putin's champion. But he [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1826.8s)]
*  turned into a dogged adversary when his Russian tax attorney Sergei Magnitsky blew the whistle on [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1832.8s)]
*  alleged large-scale theft by government officials. We discovered massive corruption of the Putin [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1839.68s)]
*  regime. Sergei exposed it, testified against the officials involved. He was subsequently arrested, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1845.76s)]
*  put in pretrial detention, tortured for 358 days, and killed at the age of 37. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1852.96s)]
*  Browder was so outraged, he joined with Vladimir Kara Mirza to lobby the U.S. Congress for a law [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1859.2800000000002s)]
*  targeting those responsible for that death and other human rights violations. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1866.24s)]
*  They succeeded. The Magnitsky Act passed in 2012. It's the first law that sanctions [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1871.2s)]
*  individual Russians, 44 so far. The Magnitsky Act is designed to sanction, to freeze the assets [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1877.76s)]
*  and ban the visas for people who commit these types of crimes in Russia. So they can't get to [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1886.8799999999999s)]
*  their money, which may be stashed in the United States. And so Vladimir Putin is extremely angry [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1893.12s)]
*  that the Magnitsky Act was going to be passed. He was even angrier when it got passed, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1898.48s)]
*  and he was even angrier when people started getting added, names started getting added to the [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1903.1999999999998s)]
*  Magnitsky list. One reason Vladimir Kara Mirza is convinced he was targeted is because six people [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1907.36s)]
*  connected to the Magnitsky case, as he was, have ended up dead. One of them was Boris Nemtsov, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1914.0s)]
*  a leader of Russia's opposition and Kara Mirza's partner in lobbying for the Magnitsky Act. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1920.96s)]
*  On the 27th of February 2015, he was killed by five bullets in the back as he was walking home, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1927.12s)]
*  as he always did out in the open without bodyguards. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1933.84s)]
*  This was an assassination. In some of the deaths, proving there was foul play has been a challenge. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1936.48s)]
*  Take the case of this Russian banker who came forward with incriminating documents related to [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1943.5200000000002s)]
*  the Magnitsky case. Alexander Parapolichny was a whistleblower. At the age of 44, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1949.5200000000002s)]
*  he went jogging outside his home in Surrey, outside of London, and dropped dead. The police deemed it [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1954.72s)]
*  a unsuspicious natural death. Well, they did look for poison. They just couldn't find any. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1961.44s)]
*  They did a very first-round toxicology screen. They didn't find anything on the first run through. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1966.64s)]
*  Detecting poison can be extremely difficult, and there's a reason. This Cold War CIA memo [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1972.96s)]
*  reveals that the Soviets ran a laboratory for poisons in a large and super-secret installation [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1980.0s)]
*  known as the Chamber to test undetectable compounds. In the case of the banker in London, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1986.72s)]
*  the coroner wasn't willing to give up. He ordered more tests, and three years later, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=1994.0s)]
*  it was revealed in court that an exotic toxin was found with the help of an authority on flowers. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2000.08s)]
*  A small sample of his stomach contents was sent to a botanical garden outside of London, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2006.72s)]
*  and one of the scientists found a compound called Jelcemian elegans, which is a Chinese herb. They [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2013.76s)]
*  call it the heartbreak grass, and it causes a person to die unexpectedly without explanation. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2020.0s)]
*  Still, there's no direct evidence of a Kremlin connection. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2028.3999999999999s)]
*  But the list of those who've come to die unexpectedly after running afoul of Mr. Putin [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2032.24s)]
*  is long. Political opponents and human rights lawyers have been shot. Overly inquisitive [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2037.6799999999998s)]
*  reporters have perished in mysterious plane crashes or by car bombs, by poison or gunfire. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2044.1599999999999s)]
*  Journalist Anna Polakovskaya was poisoned and shot. Then there are enemies who kill themselves, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2052.24s)]
*  one by hanging, one by stabbing himself to death with two knives, and one by tying himself to a [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2059.6s)]
*  chair and jumping into a swimming pool. Some of Putin's opponents are in prison, others forced [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2066.72s)]
*  out of the country, like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, probably Putin's most famous living critic. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2073.6s)]
*  Are you afraid for your own life? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2080.24s)]
*  For a period of over 10 years, Vladimir Putin had ample opportunity to make a decision about [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2083.04s)]
*  putting an end to my life in a very easy way, just by snapping his fingers. And today, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2088.72s)]
*  it's a little bit more difficult. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2095.2s)]
*  Khodorkovsky was once the richest man in Russia until he took to opposing Putin. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2096.8799999999997s)]
*  He was put on trial, his oil company confiscated, and then thrown in prison for 10 years. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2102.96s)]
*  Home is now London, where he funds a Russian pro-democracy movement. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2109.7599999999998s)]
*  And this is where the plot thickens, because one of his senior organizers on the ground in Russia [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2114.72s)]
*  is none other than Vladimir Karamurza. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2120.3199999999997s)]
*  There are people who say that what's happened to Karamurza is a message to you, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2123.3599999999997s)]
*  a message to you to back off. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2130.0s)]
*  You know, for 10 years, I was receiving lots of messages from our authorities of various sorts. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2132.8s)]
*  And some of these messages were rather unpleasant concerning my physical well-being. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2141.6800000000003s)]
*  But the authorities saw I ignored these messages. I would like to believe that they have not [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2146.88s)]
*  forgotten that. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2150.88s)]
*  In 2015, once Vladimir Karamurza was stabilized, he was flown to Washington, D.C. to continue [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2151.52s)]
*  treatment near his wife, Yevgenia, and their three children, who live in the U.S. for their [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2159.92s)]
*  safety. But as soon as Karamurza got better, he was itching to go back to Russia. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2165.28s)]
*  I think what my husband believes in will always outweigh the fear. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2171.04s)]
*  Even for you? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2177.52s)]
*  Of course I'm terrified. But at the same time, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2178.7200000000003s)]
*  I married the guy 13 years ago, and I knew what I was getting into. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2182.64s)]
*  You know, I think there's nothing better this regime, the Putin regime, would like us to do [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2187.2799999999997s)]
*  than to give up and run away. And we're not going to give them that pleasure. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2191.2s)]
*  It's our country. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2195.12s)]
*  Even after being poisoned? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2195.6s)]
*  It's our country. We have to fight for it. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2196.72s)]
*  He told us this in June. He went back immediately after, even though threats against him had [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2198.64s)]
*  intensified, like this video posted on Instagram putting him in the crosshairs of a sniper rifle. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2204.9599999999996s)]
*  He was continuing his opposition work when just last month... [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2211.92s)]
*  All of a sudden, he begins experiencing this very elevated heart rate. His blood pressure [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2217.12s)]
*  drops very low. He begins sweating, and he has trouble breathing. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2224.48s)]
*  His wife thinks her husband was attacked the same way as before. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2230.7200000000003s)]
*  The first time, he had been dragged from one hospital to another to yet another while they [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2235.28s)]
*  were trying to establish the cause. This time, he was taken directly to the hospital to the [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2239.84s)]
*  same medical team that had treated him in 2015. And the moment they saw him, they knew what they [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2245.6000000000004s)]
*  were dealing with. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2251.6800000000003s)]
*  And what do you think happened? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2252.6400000000003s)]
*  The Russian doctor's official diagnosis is an acute intoxication [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2254.1600000000003s)]
*  by an undetermined substance, which is poisoning. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2258.6400000000003s)]
*  This happened just as Washington was raising questions about President Trump's relationship [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2263.04s)]
*  with Mr. Putin. So, last month, Vladimir Karamurza became an issue on the Senate floor. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2267.76s)]
*  The Vladimir has once again paid the price for his gallantry and integrity. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2273.5200000000004s)]
*  Politicians on both sides of the aisles spoke out against the apparent poisoning, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2278.96s)]
*  but the Trump administration has not. Remarkably, Karamurza survived again. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2283.76s)]
*  Less than three weeks after he collapsed, he was flown to the U.S., and two weeks later, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2289.92s)]
*  we spoke to him for a second time. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2295.36s)]
*  You look pretty good. How are you actually feeling? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2297.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, you're very kind. I don't think I feel as good as I look. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2300.8s)]
*  He said he's recovering faster because his doctors knew just what to do this time. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2303.2000000000003s)]
*  The Kremlin has denied any involvement, and since no poison has been found yet, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2308.88s)]
*  supporters of Putin question whether he was really poisoned at all. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2314.1600000000003s)]
*  We've been told that we are very naive, naive journalists, gullible, and that this whole thing [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2318.48s)]
*  is concocted by the opposition to fool the American people into thinking that that regime [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2326.4s)]
*  would do such a thing. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2333.04s)]
*  To those who say that this is a plot, I honestly, and I mean this sincerely, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2334.4s)]
*  I wish they never have to experience what I had experienced twice in the last two years. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2338.48s)]
*  When you're trying to breathe and you cannot, when you feel your organs shutting down, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2343.92s)]
*  giving up on you one after another, and when you feel the life coming out of your body in the next [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2347.68s)]
*  few hours, and you don't remember anything for the next month, and then for the next year, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2351.6s)]
*  you're trying to relearn how to walk, how to use cutlery, how to talk to your kids again. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2355.44s)]
*  I wish these people who tell you these things never have to experience this. I honestly, sincerely do. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2360.24s)]
*  You were very, very sick and went back. Now, are you finished? Are you saying I'm not going back? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2365.2s)]
*  Oh, God, no. Of course not. First of all, I'm- [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2372.96s)]
*  You're going to go back? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2374.72s)]
*  Of course I will absolutely go back to Russia. I'm Russian. This is my country. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2375.76s)]
*  And I believe in what I do and what my colleagues do. There are many of us. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2379.76s)]
*  But not many have almost died twice. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2383.76s)]
*  Many, unfortunately, have died. I'm the fortunate one. I'm still here. I'm still talking to you. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2386.4s)]
*  Many of my colleagues cannot do that. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2391.36s)]
*  Since he's been in power in Russia, Vladimir Putin has steadily cracked down on democratic freedoms [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2405.76s)]
*  and the protesters who support them, a crackdown that intensified after his [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2411.1200000000003s)]
*  re-election as president a year ago. Nothing symbolizes this better than the arrest last [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2416.0s)]
*  March of a group of young feminists after they staged a protest against Putin in Moscow's [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2421.76s)]
*  largest cathedral. And the fact that Putin is still in power is a sign of the fact that [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2427.76s)]
*  the Russian government is now the largest cathedral. It got a lot of attention since the Orthodox [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2434.4s)]
*  Church is one of the most revered institutions in post-Soviet Russia. The young women have [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2439.44s)]
*  become the poster girls of Russian descent. It's unlikely, considering they're a punk band on [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2445.6800000000003s)]
*  YouTube that makes lewd gestures in cartoonish get-ups. Most of what they do is deliberately [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2452.4s)]
*  you. Like for starters, they're obscene but attention-grabbing name Pussy Riot. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2459.6s)]
*  This is what got them arrested. Five girls in the church in their trademark masks called [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2469.84s)]
*  balaclavas praying to the Virgin Mary to drive Putin away. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2475.68s)]
*  Using vile obscenities, they blast Putin for limiting freedoms and jailing protesters. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2480.48s)]
*  The whole thing lasts only 51 seconds before they're shut down. It looked silly, like a prank, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2487.92s)]
*  which made the harsh punishment seem so out of proportion. Two of them were sent to labor [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2494.88s)]
*  camps for this. Now, a year later, we track down the other three who are arrested for [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2500.08s)]
*  the church. Two are in hiding. Katya Samasevich isn't. She was put on trial and convicted, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2507.12s)]
*  but released after seven months because she never actually danced on the altar. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2517.44s)]
*  That's her that day in white. Do you have any regrets about what happened that day? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2522.6400000000003s)]
*  No, of course not. Look what's happened. Since the election, Putin has brought in a new level [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2530.08s)]
*  of oppressive government measures in Russia. She says they chose Moscow's biggest Russian [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2536.16s)]
*  Orthodox cathedral because in last year's election, the patriarch called Putin a miracle from God. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2541.52s)]
*  The elections weren't legitimate. There was vote rigging. There was false counting. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2548.08s)]
*  It was clear that the president put himself in power. But are you advocating the overthrow [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2552.3999999999996s)]
*  of this government here? Yes, we want the government to leave power because we consider [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2557.68s)]
*  it illegitimate. But we're advocating for a peaceful overthrow. The band members are idealistic [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2563.52s)]
*  and brave and well-educated. Katya is a computer engineer. She was living at home with her dad [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2569.92s)]
*  and working in a government arms plant when she decided to become a political provocateur. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2577.12s)]
*  She began with anti-authority stunts like surprising female cops by kissing them, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2586.56s)]
*  then posting the video online. Her partner in crime was Nadia Tolokhina Kova, a philosophy student [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2593.12s)]
*  and seasoned agitator. They formed their punk band as Moscow was boiling over with protests in 2011 [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2605.12s)]
*  after Putin announced his bid for reelection. It was Russia's Arab Spring and the band made up of [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2614.4s)]
*  12 or so feminists who call themselves girls or dovushki set out to change the world. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2621.76s)]
*  They staged public disturbances like this one in the middle of Red Square right under the Kremlin [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2629.76s)]
*  howling riot, riot, shouting a profanity that Putin was so scared of protesters, quote, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2635.92s)]
*  he peed in his pants. Here you girls are, you're clearly really intelligent and you put on these [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2644.4s)]
*  crude almost juvenile acts. This is the language we've chosen, the language of punk. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2653.04s)]
*  It's not highly intellectual, it's intentionally lowered, dumbed down. We've chosen this specific [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2661.04s)]
*  kind of language to attract attention. The Kremlin didn't pay much attention until the [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2666.88s)]
*  church performance because that went viral. Katya, Nadia and another girl Maria Alokina [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2671.76s)]
*  were arrested and then quickly became a cause celeb. South Park, Amnesty International, Madonna [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2678.1600000000003s)]
*  pled for their release. Their supporters like chess master Gary Kasparov, who's been arrested [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2688.1600000000003s)]
*  many times for protesting against Putin, thought the case was trumped up. A lot of people, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2695.0400000000004s)]
*  I know who you would respect, think that to be obscene in a church on the altar was a step too [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2701.36s)]
*  far. It was not a blasphemy. They asked Virgin Mary to kick out the dictator. I believe it was [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2709.04s)]
*  an act of civil courage and they were exercising their rights. Yeah, but the words were offensive. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2715.52s)]
*  The words were offensive for Putin and for Patriarch and I believe they both deserved it. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2722.8s)]
*  But what exactly was the crime the band committed? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2729.44s)]
*  Sergey Markov, an academic who serves as a political spokesman for Putin, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2733.36s)]
*  says authorities had trouble coming up with one. What exact law did they break? You know, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2738.4s)]
*  some people say all they did was sing a song. They didn't even sing it. They lip-synched it. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2745.6s)]
*  On this issue, that's right. It's the problem with to find the law. Finally, the court founded the law. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2749.68s)]
*  What they found was the charge of hooliganism motivated by religious hate because the girls [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2757.52s)]
*  were disrespectful to the church. And Markov says if they had not been given a substantial sentence, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2763.2s)]
*  believers would have rioted. Did the authorities intervene and say, give them a harsh penalty, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2769.68s)]
*  much harsher than they deserved because of a fear of violence? Absolutely. But is that right? Do you [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2775.92s)]
*  think that's right to stretch the law? It's duty of authorities to stop the violence. But there [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2783.6s)]
*  hadn't been any violence. It's a clerical prediction. In their trial, the girls were defiant, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2792.32s)]
*  Nadia pumping her fist as she was led into court. If Putin gave them a stage, they were going to [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2797.92s)]
*  use it. Did you ever consider begging for forgiveness, throwing yourself at the mercy of the court? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2804.72s)]
*  No. The whole process was so unfair to us from the beginning. It's strange when you're innocent. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2811.6800000000003s)]
*  Are you supposed to ask for forgiveness from the judge who's ready to put you away for several [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2818.88s)]
*  years? No. This wasn't even discussed. Were you in the courtroom? Yes, all the whole time. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2823.52s)]
*  Piotr Verzilov, Nadia's husband and fellow political activist, saw his wife and the other two [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2830.1600000000003s)]
*  on display in a cage, an eerie echo of a Soviet show trial. When the verdict came, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2836.88s)]
*  it was a jolt, two years in prison. For me, it was obviously a shock. It's the last thing you [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2844.08s)]
*  expected. Yes. What about the girls? Well, the girls were smiling when it happened. They were [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2850.6400000000003s)]
*  smiling? When you're really put in this helpless situation, when you understand that your life is [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2855.6s)]
*  decided by political motives and a lot of people really do understand that you're fighting for the [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2860.48s)]
*  good cause, the best thing you can do is to actually smile. Katya was released, but Maria [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2866.32s)]
*  and Nadia, both young mothers of toddlers, were sent to faraway penal colonies. When the verdict [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2872.56s)]
*  was read, protests erupted outside the courtroom, and Garry Kasparov and two dozen others were [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2880.0s)]
*  arrested. Is this case of this punk rock group, is it really significant? Is it important? I think [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2886.4s)]
*  it is. Any attack on Putin is now a crime. Russia is now, you may call it a modern dictatorship, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2894.16s)]
*  because attacking the ruler can be punished by the criminal court. And they represent that shift. Yes. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2901.68s)]
*  They exposed it. What was it about them that drew so much attention? You may say whatever you want [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2911.2s)]
*  about their performance, but it was innocuous. I mean, just it was not threatening. And the state [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2918.72s)]
*  machine, KGB, George, you know, all going after them. I think it's just, you know, this some sort [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2925.2799999999997s)]
*  of a version of, it's not even David Goliath. It's just, you know, Goliath versus girls. That was not [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2930.72s)]
*  lost on those close to Putin. It looked like a very heavy-handed action against these weak, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2936.8799999999997s)]
*  little girls. Yeah. Like way overreaction. Yeah. We know this. No one cares. I mean, you don't. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2943.2s)]
*  No, no, no. We care about this. The image. Yeah. We doesn't like such awful image of Russia, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2950.7999999999997s)]
*  because it's create problems for us. This image doesn't allow millions of Russian who want to [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2956.56s)]
*  travel to Germany, Italy, France, and to have vacations there. They don't allow to do this. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2964.16s)]
*  It's stop investment to Russian economy. All because of this trial? Yes, of course, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2970.56s)]
*  because bad image. All because of the trial of those girls. Of course. But we have to do, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2977.44s)]
*  because we have to protect ourselves, because if we will be weak, our image will be even worse. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2985.2s)]
*  It doesn't help the image that Nadia and Maria are suffering in harsh prison conditions. Maria [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=2994.8s)]
*  is in Perm, where temperatures can dip to 50 below zero. Back in Moscow, her husband is raising their [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3001.6800000000003s)]
*  five-year-old son alone. We accompanied Nadia's husband, Piotr, on a seven-hour drive to Mordovia [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3008.48s)]
*  to see her. IK-18. That's what it's called. He says she works grueling shifts, sewing uniforms, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3015.6800000000003s)]
*  and that she's seen their five-year-old daughter, Gira, only once. Did you and Nadia talk about [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3022.56s)]
*  your child and the consequences? I'm talking about beforehand, the consequences of this little girl [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3030.0s)]
*  being raised without her mother? Well, obviously, we did talk about that enormously. But if you [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3036.72s)]
*  really want to change history, you have to be able to put everything you have on the line. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3043.12s)]
*  And then you do have a chance of changing it. Changing history is not a hobby. It's not something [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3047.92s)]
*  you can take part time. But there were four girls on the altar that day. What happened to the other [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3051.84s)]
*  two? Well, they went into hiding. We found one of them still hiding in Moscow a year later. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3057.6800000000003s)]
*  So what do they call you? Kot. Kot. You're the drummer in the group. Are you good? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3065.1200000000003s)]
*  Kot agreed to go on television for the first time, though only in disguised voice and balaclava. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3075.28s)]
*  She wanted to show us that the band still exists. So she led us into a netherworld where some members [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3081.84s)]
*  of the band get together. She says very few people know her identity. Do your parents [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3087.92s)]
*  know that you're in the protest? They know. They're not really happy about it. My dad, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3094.8s)]
*  he's religious. He thought what we did, it was sort of an anti-Christ kind of act. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3102.4s)]
*  She had managed to dodge the authorities after the performance by hiding in the rat-infested [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3108.16s)]
*  music studio where they had recorded the song that got her bandmates arrested. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3113.68s)]
*  Kot believes she will be left alone now as long as she keeps a low profile. Are you at all worried [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3119.12s)]
*  that just giving us this interview will be seen as a protest? I am a little worried. It's a feeling [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3125.84s)]
*  similar to what I had before the performances we did. Do you want it to be seen as a protest? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3133.52s)]
*  I do. I want this. I'm here to say you shouldn't give up. What happened to us is unacceptable. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3139.52s)]
*  It's been a year. President Putin is firmly back in power with solid public support. As for the [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3148.32s)]
*  opposition, several organizers of last year's protests are facing prosecution. Nadia and Maria [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3155.28s)]
*  are soon up for parole, but the band has not staged a single action since the trial, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3162.24s)]
*  and their videos are now banned. Mr. Putin seems stronger than ever. There are new laws against [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3167.7599999999998s)]
*  dissent. Sounds like it was David and Goliath, and Goliath won. I don't think it's like that. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3174.16s)]
*  It's a fight. It's an ongoing fight. Just because there was a court case doesn't mean that we're [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3181.2s)]
*  going to stop and shut our mouths. We have a lot of things to say. We're going to continue to work, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3186.0s)]
*  continue to do what we do. So the battle of Goliath and the girls goes on, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3191.12s)]
*  but like a Russian novel, it's complicated. The polls show that most Russians were offended by [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3198.96s)]
*  that dance on the altar, but most also think the punishment was way too severe. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gB5X2GydtY&t=3205.2799999999997s)]
