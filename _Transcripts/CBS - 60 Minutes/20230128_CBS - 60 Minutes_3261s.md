# Grizzlies, Elephants, Giant Pandas, Wolves | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [January 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA)
*  When Lewis and Clark first encountered grizzly bears, there may have been a hundred thousand [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=0.0s)]
*  of them in the American West from what is now Canada all the way down to Mexico. Grizzlies [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=18.96s)]
*  are among the most fearsome predators on the planet, so for the next 150 years they were [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=24.72s)]
*  systematically exterminated by settlers, ranchers, and farmers who saw them as a threat to their [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=30.96s)]
*  lives and livelihoods. By the 1960s, there were just a few hundred left in the lower 48 states. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  In 1975, grizzly bears were among the first animals to be protected under the Endangered [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=44.16s)]
*  Species Act, and what's happened since, especially in the state of Montana, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=49.84s)]
*  is a story both of conservation and conflict. Ever been face to face with a grizzly? Neither had we. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  In the Swan Mountains of northwestern Montana, we are carrying bear spray and following state [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=66.48s)]
*  bear specialist Eric Wenham and his colleague Milan Vinks deep into the woods. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=72.80000000000001s)]
*  Hey! Wenham is checking one of several traps called snares. Oh, there's a bear. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=80.8s)]
*  That he has baited with beaver meat. Grizzly bear. You hear that? The closer we get, the more agitated [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=87.12s)]
*  she's going to become, so we'll kind of be quiet, get a good weight assessment on her, and then we'll [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=95.04s)]
*  just drift right back out. Okay? I'm with you. All right. You're okay. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=100.48s)]
*  You're all right. You're okay. You're okay. You're all right. You're all right. After the wire [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=114.4s)]
*  snare around its wrist stops the first charge at Wenham, the grizzly makes another effort to get [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=124.08s)]
*  at our cameraman Don Lee. You're all right. We'll drift out. Do you have an estimate of how big that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=130.48s)]
*  bear is? How much do you think she weighs? I think it's right around 300 pounds. That's mid-size for [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=142.64s)]
*  grizzly. They can weigh as much as a thousand pounds and stand nine feet tall on their hind legs. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  We're going to mix a little bit of metatomidine in there. Wenham and Vinks mix a cocktail of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=155.68s)]
*  veterinary sedatives and load them into a dart gun. You have the dart, I have the bear spray, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=160.24s)]
*  and they're ready to go. We are set. Vinks carries a shotgun loaded with lethal ammunition just in case. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=166.56s)]
*  Wenham insists that neither the tranquilizer nor the snare do any lasting harm [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  and that he needs both as part of a project to attach radio collars to grizzlies and track [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=185.36s)]
*  their population's recovery. To me having a grizzly bear population means that the ecosystem is intact. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  Hilary Cooley is the wildlife biologist in charge of grizzly bear recovery for the U.S. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=200.8s)]
*  Fish and Wildlife Service. Grizzly bears were listed in 1975 as a threatened species in the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=206.56s)]
*  lower 48 states. You thought their survival was in jeopardy? Yeah, their range had been reduced by [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=213.36s)]
*  about 98 percent. Two places grizzlies hadn't been wiped out were Glacier and Yellowstone National [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=219.52s)]
*  Parks where a few hundred were protected from eradication. So starting 45 years ago, the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=226.96s)]
*  recovery effort focused on millions of acres around those two parks. They've probably more [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=234.0s)]
*  than tripled their numbers and their range now is more than double what it was at the time of listing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=240.56s)]
*  Since listed as an endangered species back in 1975, the grizzly bear population in this region [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=246.8s)]
*  has made a remarkable comeback, a true success story. But at the same time, another population [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=252.96s)]
*  has also been growing around here, the human population with houses and subdivisions built [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=259.52s)]
*  right next to the wilderness and that's often where the trouble starts. Montana's human population [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  has grown by 250,000 since grizzlies were protected in 1975. Most of those people live on [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  valley floors or in foothills not far from bear country. When you can look at the telemetry from [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=281.2s)]
*  their collars, you realize that at night this valley belongs to bears. A bear has walked, I've [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=287.6s)]
*  seen the telemetry, through the spot where you and I are sitting right now and we are within 100 feet [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=293.04s)]
*  of my house. Bryce Andrews is a rancher, author and field director for a non-profit called People [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=297.92s)]
*  and Carnivores which tries to minimize human bear conflict. He's seen all the videos of grizzlies [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=304.72s)]
*  going through trash cans, raiding chicken coops and backyard bird feeders, even the fridge. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=312.16s)]
*  They are true omnivores and really hungry from the moment they emerge from hibernation each spring. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  Anything with caloric value, a bear will turn it into what they need to survive. So they will eat [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=327.6s)]
*  any and everything. Any and everything. They'll come for bird seed, they'll come for the residue [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=333.44000000000005s)]
*  on a barbecue. It's their appetites that get them into trouble with humans. Absolutely. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=338.56s)]
*  The greatest trouble comes when grizzlies go after livestock or crops that ranchers and farmers [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=346.16s)]
*  count on for their livelihoods. Bears can be really hard to live with. They kill livestock. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=352.8s)]
*  There are producers who have 20, 30 cows a year killed by grizzly bears and so for those folks, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=359.2s)]
*  it's a lot. It's a big impact. The bears probably knocked down between 20 and 25 percent of my corn [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=366.72s)]
*  that I couldn't harvest every year. Greg Schock farms in Montana's Mission Valley. He says grizzlies [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  live in the woods about a mile from his home. We had 18 several years in a row in our cornfield [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  and nobody believed that I had that many until they put cameras up and actually had footage of [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=385.92s)]
*  them. 18 in your cornfield? In a hundred acre cornfield, yeah. With so many grizzlies around, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=391.6s)]
*  now nearly 2,000, the federal government would like to remove some populations from the endangered [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  species list. So far court challenges from environmental groups and Native Americans [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=405.36s)]
*  have prevented that. You think it is possible to coexist? I think we have to. If we don't coexist, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=411.36s)]
*  what's who's leaving? The bears aren't leaving and we aren't leaving. So Bryce Andrews organization [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=418.16s)]
*  does things like install high voltage electric fences around fields like this 30 acre melon farm. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=425.20000000000005s)]
*  Grizzlies are smart enough to test the fences and sometimes even get around them. We've got an [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=433.52000000000004s)]
*  electrified gate here which is off right now. Andrews has an electric fence around his backyard [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=440.64000000000004s)]
*  chicken coop but not all of his neighbors do. Generally when there are unprotected chickens in [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=446.48s)]
*  grizzly habitat it's only a matter of time before something goes wrong. The grizzly bear will win. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=451.76s)]
*  They'll win and see they have these phenomenal noses. They smell everything. Including neighborhood [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=457.20000000000005s)]
*  trash cans. If a grizzly develops a taste for garbage, gets accustomed to being near people [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=462.88s)]
*  and then teaches those bad habits to her cubs it can prove fatal. Bears that get into such trouble [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=469.68s)]
*  are often trapped by state bear managers. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=477.92s)]
*  At first they're relocated to remote regions and released [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=484.0s)]
*  but if they keep coming back, federal official Hillary Cooley may need to authorize killing them. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=490.64s)]
*  Ultimately that's my decision. What's that like? It's the worst part of the job. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=499.68s)]
*  It's but it's necessary. Why necessary? If we think it's a threat to human safety, for example [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=505.6s)]
*  a food-conditioned bear, bears can kill people and it's something we don't mess with. If there's a [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=511.76s)]
*  threat to human safety we remove it right off the bat. And remove you? Euthanize. Euthanize. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=518.0s)]
*  Just last year she had to authorize the killing of nearly 50 grizzlies. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=524.08s)]
*  Hey. The grizzly bear we saw Eric Wenham tranquilize in the Swan Mountains may never [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  have seen a human being before, let alone gotten into trouble. Do you know is it a male or a female? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=537.68s)]
*  I don't yet. How long will this grizzly be out? About an hour. About an hour? 20 minutes. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=543.28s)]
*  It's a male. Why why were you hoping for a female? We want to radio-collar females. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=549.76s)]
*  Females drive the system. They really do. One, two, three. Will you collar him? We collar some males. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=559.2s)]
*  We're not going to collar this guy. Look at those claws. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=568.4s)]
*  The forest becomes a field hospital as they attach monitors and even an oxygen bottle to the grizzly. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=571.76s)]
*  So he's at 88 oxygen. I like it when it's 90-95 so I want to get him up. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=577.76s)]
*  We measured every part of the bear. Five and a quarter. Okay. Blood is drawn. Tuffs of hair [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=588.1600000000001s)]
*  pulled for DNA analysis. I'm going to call him a five-year-old bear. Okay. So you can see these [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=595.44s)]
*  are incisors and if you run your fingernail over the top you can still feel some cusping. So tell [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=601.6s)]
*  me I can do this. Stick my hand in a grizzly bear's mouth. I'm telling you you can do that. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=607.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. How about that? Less than an hour after being darted a bit ahead of schedule, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=613.2800000000001s)]
*  he's moving a little bit here. The grizzly starts to stir. So he's starting to wake up. Okay. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=620.64s)]
*  Everybody ready to go. Get his head on out. Everybody go. We didn't need to be told again. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  As we hustled out, Wenham removed the hood from the bear's head and hurried out himself. Your [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=636.0s)]
*  first question will be does that happen often? When he was sniffing up, when he's lifting his head, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=642.16s)]
*  it's time to go. It's time to go. We had about as safe an encounter with a grizzly bear as is [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=647.92s)]
*  possible to have, but with more people going deep into bear country to hike or bike or camp or hunt, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=653.36s)]
*  there are several decidedly unsafe encounters every year. I didn't really get a warning and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=660.88s)]
*  all of a sudden there's a grizzly bear running at me and in about probably less than a second [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=667.68s)]
*  it was on me. Anders Broesty was hunting for deer and elk with a friend in the wilderness [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=673.76s)]
*  north of his Montana home on November 11th, 2018 when he stumbled upon a grizzly who'd been dozing [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=679.6s)]
*  in the snow. It bit my arm here, kind of thrashed it around and then bit my leg here, started pulling [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=686.64s)]
*  on me and kind of tossing me around and then it just dropped my foot and ran off. Do you have any [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=694.1600000000001s)]
*  idea why he didn't just finish you off or drag you off? Nope. Broesty's hunting partner, Dan, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=699.68s)]
*  reached him within a minute or two. Luckily they had a cell phone signal to call 911. State bear [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=707.1999999999999s)]
*  specialist Eric Wenham was one of the first responders on the scene and he snapped a photo [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=714.64s)]
*  of a very large paw print in the snow. They had to chopper you out? Two choppers. How long are you [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=721.12s)]
*  in the hospital? I was in the hospital for six days. In that six days I had three different [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=728.32s)]
*  surgeries. My arm was broken, my thumb was broken and my hand was dislocated. My foot was basically [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=734.32s)]
*  held to my my ankle with soft tissue. This is the grizzly that attacked Anders Broesty in a photo [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=740.48s)]
*  taken four years earlier when state bear managers trapped and released him. DNA samples proved the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=747.84s)]

*  that? I'm okay with it. I was intruding so to me the bear's response was not any more inappropriate [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=761.12s)]
*  than what somebody else's response would be if I trespassed into their home. Broesty, who is the [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=768.32s)]

*  and he says he and his friend Dan plan to go hunting again this November 11th, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=781.1199999999999s)]
*  the anniversary of the attack. I think it's part of what makes Montana wild. If we didn't have [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=786.9599999999999s)]
*  grizzly bears like it'd be a little less wild. They're a part of our ecosystem. They play a role [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=794.0s)]
*  in everything that's going on around here. I think that's kind of cool. I'd prefer not to see one [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=799.92s)]
*  that close again though. For two decades a group of wild African elephants has been watched over, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=805.92s)]

*  Turcalo. As you're about to see, Andrea's own story is pretty amazing but not nearly as compelling [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=829.52s)]
*  as the insights into elephant behavior her research has revealed, especially when it comes to the [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=835.84s)]
*  secret language of elephants. Elephants communicate in a complicated, sophisticated language that [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=841.1999999999999s)]
*  scientists are trying to decipher and compile into the world's first elephant dictionary. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=847.12s)]
*  When we heard that this is all happening in one of the most magical places on earth, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=852.3199999999999s)]
*  a remote clearing in central Africa where forest elephants, the rarest, most mysterious and most [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=856.96s)]
*  threatened member of the species congregate, well, we simply had to go. The Sanga River flows through [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=863.12s)]
*  the Congo Basin along the border between Cameroon and the Central African Republic in the second [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=871.68s)]
*  largest rainforest on earth. This remote corner of the world is the place Andrea Turcalo, a field [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=877.68s)]
*  biologist from Taunton, Massachusetts, has called home for nearly two decades. Andrea lives in a [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=884.32s)]
*  compound that she and a group of pygmies built from scratch. The pygmies help her run the place. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=890.88s)]
*  Commuting to her job is a hike. The last couple of miles took us through some interesting terrain. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=898.4000000000001s)]
*  Okay, now we're going to enter the forest and the advice I'd like to give everyone [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=905.2s)]
*  at this point is to stick together. Stick together? Yeah, because if we happen to run [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=908.8800000000001s)]
*  into elephants, we should all stay together and move in the same direction so we don't confuse them. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=912.72s)]
*  We don't want a confused elephant. A confused elephant could be dangerous. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=916.96s)]
*  Fortunately, running into one on the trail is rare. So who made this trail, Andrea? This was made by [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=921.12s)]
*  hundreds of years of elephant traffic in this forest. Elephants made the trail. Yeah, I mean, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=927.12s)]
*  if you look at their feet, it's obviously, you know, they do a lot of road work. The elephants [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=931.44s)]
*  have stumped out the equivalent of a vast interstate highway system. They took us past [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  giant teak trees through a thick primordial forest. Andrea has hiked this trail twice a day [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=941.12s)]
*  for nearly 20 years. Where does it go? We could hear something before we could see anything. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=947.36s)]
*  Suddenly, the trail ended and right before us was an opening called the Dzanga clearing [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=957.52s)]
*  and more than 50 forest elephants. The setting was extraordinary straight out of Jurassic Park, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=962.8s)]
*  tranquil aside from an occasional roar. Andrea, do you remember the very first time you saw this place? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=971.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was in the late 80s and I actually slept here. Slept here? Yeah, and I slept on the ground [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=980.7199999999999s)]
*  in a tent and all night there was this symphony of elephants. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=987.2800000000001s)]
*  And when I woke in the morning, it was like I had landed in paradise. The clearing is a watering hole, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=993.2800000000001s)]
*  a spa and a sanctuary, a place where elephants take their time, the measured graceful pace of [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=999.36s)]
*  the largest land animal on earth. They come to the clearing for the minerals, which they can't seem [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1006.4000000000001s)]
*  to get enough of. It's a place where elephants play. These elephants are playing sort of amateur [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1013.2s)]
*  wrestling for pachyderms. Nobody gets hurt. Kids fall and get up the way kids do. This elephant [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1019.76s)]
*  is giving himself a massage, a tree massage. Here's one trying to hide unsuccessfully. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1027.92s)]
*  All this and so much more observed by Andrea and others day after day. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1035.28s)]
*  It's been now 19 years that I've been observing this particular population of elephants. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1042.08s)]
*  Very long time. Yeah, it is a long time, but it takes a long time to know elephants. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1046.08s)]
*  When Andrea first came here, she knew almost nothing about forest elephants. Today, she's the [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1050.8799999999999s)]
*  world's leading expert on them. From an observation deck on the edge of the clearing, she collects [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1056.3999999999999s)]
*  scientific data for Cornell University and the Wildlife Conservation Society. She watches elephants [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1061.6799999999998s)]
*  almost every day for hours, counting their numbers, monitoring their health, and observing [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1068.48s)]
*  their social behavior. What are the basic differences between the boys and the girls? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1074.88s)]
*  Females and their young stay together for longer periods of time. As you can see, these groups are [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1079.92s)]
*  made up of adult females and they're young. Bulls tend to leave their groups early and be solitary, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1084.16s)]
*  but they occasionally meet up with their families and speak to each other. But the boys go off on [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1089.6s)]
*  their own and just sort of drop by now and then. Yeah, they like adventure. They don't like the [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1093.2s)]
*  group life. Are there other ways in which elephants are like us? The females tend to be like to be [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1098.0s)]
*  courted by older experienced males. Uh-huh, they don't like the young ones. No, the young ones want [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1104.72s)]
*  to want to get to the point too quickly. Now what are they making noise about right now? That's the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1109.2s)]
*  Penelope family. And it's their way of saying hello. Andrea knows it's the Penelope family [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1117.2s)]
*  because she named them and nearly a thousand other elephants. She also recognizes them by [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1122.64s)]
*  their voices. Voices researchers are trying to translate into what could someday become [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1128.5600000000002s)]
*  an elephant dictionary. I find this elephant dictionary compiling exceedingly fascinating. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1134.16s)]
*  I mean, how large a dictionary will it be? We don't know. We have to really know a lot more about [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1140.16s)]
*  the behavior of these animals to sort of sort out these different vocalizations and what they mean. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1145.5200000000002s)]
*  Andrea's expertise brought her to the attention of Cornell University. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1151.04s)]
*  Peter Regge, a behavioral biologist from Cornell, says the dictionary is still in its early stages. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1155.28s)]
*  We're in kindergarten. We're just learning the very first few words and Andrea is going to help us [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1161.76s)]
*  put those words together. You say we're in kindergarten now. Yes. Are we in the process [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1170.72s)]
*  of compiling a child's dictionary? Even an infant's dictionary. It's a very, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1175.52s)]
*  very complex process because we can't ask the elephant what did you just say. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1182.72s)]
*  But they can match elephant sounds with behavior they can see and classify those sounds into [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1187.76s)]
*  distinct categories. Can you tell me what some of them are? Well, there's these low frequency [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1193.76s)]
*  rumbles. It sounds like a big cat purring. Those are the vocalizations that help keep [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1198.88s)]
*  groups in contact with each other. There are protest calls. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1203.12s)]
*  In newborns, you have a particularly high cry and when you hear it, you know it's a very, very young calf. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1213.36s)]
*  And some of these big bulls, when they go into must, which is this sexual state, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1221.84s)]
*  they make a special rumble, which is very low and very pulsating. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1226.9599999999998s)]
*  Most days, Andrea works into the evenings compiling data and exchanging information with researchers back in the U.S. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1234.08s)]
*  via the internet, which she also uses to stay in touch with home. This is NPR Worldwide from Washington. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1242.9599999999998s)]
*  The archive of elephant behavior and sounds she's created is amazing and surprising. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1249.4399999999998s)]
*  These fearsome noises are actually elephants greeting one another. Glad to see you come a little closer. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1255.2s)]
*  These are sounds of annoyance. The big bulls are telling the youngsters to hit the road. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1266.96s)]
*  Back in 2000, Andrea filmed the death of a baby and the traumatized prize of the other elephants. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1275.36s)]
*  These elephants kept poking the body over and over, frantically trying to coax the baby back to life. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1282.08s)]
*  Then the elephants formed a procession that filed past the body. They'd feel it or they'd smell it and [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1288.8799999999999s)]
*  then they'd vocalize. It was like a funeral procession that went on three or four days. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1295.04s)]
*  Must have been an amazing sight. They seem to recognize death and it upsets them. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1298.6399999999999s)]
*  It sort of brought home how emotional these animals are. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1303.36s)]
*  But it turns out that these vocalizations are just a small fraction of the sounds elephants make. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1306.48s)]
*  Until a few years ago, scientists had no idea that most of what elephants are saying [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1312.08s)]
*  can't be heard by the human ear. The base of their vocalization is infrasonic. In other words, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1317.52s)]
*  the frequency on which their call is built is below what we can hear. The elephants use those low sounds [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1324.16s)]
*  to find one another in the dense forests where they spend most of their time. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1332.08s)]
*  Elephants are using very low frequencies which travel far. How far? At least two or three kilometers. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1339.1999999999998s)]
*  No kidding, more than a mile. Yes. An elephant standing here can communicate with sound with an [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1346.48s)]
*  elephant more than a mile away. Yes. Six thousand miles away in upstate New York at a lab at Cornell [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1353.52s)]
*  University, researchers are listening to everything from the sound of hummingbirds to the sound of [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1362.4s)]
*  whales. The elephant listening project grew out of an accidental discovery made by its founder, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1367.92s)]
*  Katie Payne, one of the world's leading experts on elephant communication. I love animals, right? So [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1375.52s)]
*  I went to the zoo. The elephant cage. Elephant cage. And I began to realize that I was feeling [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1382.24s)]
*  a throbbing in my ears and in the air that I couldn't really explain. And I said, you know, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1387.52s)]
*  do you suppose elephants are making sounds below the pitches that I can hear? And we recorded for [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1395.2s)]
*  a month. And lo and behold, we found that elephants had a great many sounds that people didn't know [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1401.92s)]
*  about. She gave us examples of sounds that we can hear. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1408.96s)]
*  Sound which I interpret generally as everything is in order. Everything's okay with the world. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1419.28s)]
*  Everything's okay. But then how do you discover the meaning of these sounds? You just watch and [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1427.28s)]
*  watch and watch and record and record and record and keep the two together. Which brings us back [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1433.1200000000001s)]
*  to Andrea. Once or twice a year, she visits Cornell with her latest recordings. And you're [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1438.64s)]
*  giving them the material with which they work. Yes. This is a scene we filmed on the 1st of May, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1444.48s)]
*  the first birth we witnessed in 19 years. Oh, they're two females. After owing and eyeing over [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1449.5200000000002s)]
*  the new baby, as anyone would, the scientists get down to the business of figuring out what the [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1456.24s)]
*  elephant sounds mean. I'm betting that these two calls are the same individual. Figuring out which [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1462.16s)]
*  elephant is talking, where it's located and what it's saying has been a big challenge. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1468.08s)]
*  Researchers initially strung nine acoustic recording devices around the clearing. As the [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1473.4399999999998s)]
*  sound reached each recorder at a different time, they could pinpoint the location of the speaking [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1478.8s)]
*  elephant. Picking up sounds too low to hear was another challenge. But recording the sounds [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1483.76s)]
*  normally and playing them back faster was a revelation. For example, the clearing at night [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1489.12s)]
*  sounds like this. Played back three times faster, this is what the clearing sounds like. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1495.44s)]
*  You can hear the elephant's rumbling calls. But to figure out what the calls mean, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1509.76s)]
*  the Cornell team spends more time looking than listening. Using these computer generated [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1514.96s)]
*  spectrograms, they can see the low frequency sounds. And then we can actually visually [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1519.76s)]
*  look at the calls. And what does this visualization tell us? It tells us that there is incredible [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1526.0s)]
*  complexity. Many of their calls are actually similar in some ways to human speech. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1531.6s)]
*  Peter, does all this research into elephant sounds have any practical purpose? We're using [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1536.4s)]
*  sound recordings to monitor forest elephants because they're so difficult to see. And this [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1543.44s)]
*  becomes more and more critical because their population is threatened. So knowing where the [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1548.88s)]
*  animals are gives us a way to begin attacking what has to be preserved or where do we need to put [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1555.3600000000001s)]
*  more protection. Protection because poaching has become almost epidemic. It's estimated that [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1560.96s)]
*  annually 10% of Djanga's elephants are killed for their ivory. Andrea works closely with Djanga's [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1566.96s)]
*  armed guards, but so far their efforts have not stopped the slaughter. Do you see it as your [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1573.44s)]
*  personal responsibility to protect the elephants here? I've made it my personal responsibility. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1578.64s)]
*  For me, if I've been given this great privilege to study this particular population of elephants, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1583.92s)]
*  I think my priority is to protect them. Otherwise I have no right to study them. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1589.3600000000001s)]
*  Excuse me, we have a vocalization. That's a protest. A protest. That's somebody who's probably [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1595.3600000000001s)]
*  being refused something by its mother. Baby elephants protest in a rather loud fashion, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1600.72s)]
*  don't they? Yeah, they're just like little bratty children. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1605.52s)]
*  Andrea believes if she weren't here, the clearing would become a killing field. It's clear that [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1610.8s)]
*  in a very pragmatic sense you are saving the elephants. But in another sense they've saved me. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1617.68s)]
*  I have something very important in my life to do and I think a lot of people don't get to do that. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1624.48s)]
*  Andrea plans to stay here at least another 15 years and as night falls over her clearing [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1629.12s)]
*  and fishermen flow gently down the Sanga, you can hear the crickets. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1636.6399999999999s)]
*  What you can't hear are the elephants, but that doesn't mean they aren't talking. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1641.12s)]
*  Chinese call them xiang mao, meaning bear that looks like a cat. The adjective they use is mung, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1659.36s)]
*  which translates cute like a baby. Until recently the giant panda was on its way to extinction, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1667.12s)]
*  but then it was saved by its one evolutionary advantage. It's adorable. In 2016 the panda's [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1674.56s)]
*  conservation status was upgraded from endangered to just vulnerable. Because the giant panda is [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1683.44s)]
*  China's national symbol, the Chinese have worked four decades to perfect breeding the bears in [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1689.44s)]
*  captivity. They've achieved one of the biggest successes in conservation, but there is more work [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1696.24s)]
*  to do. The next step is introducing captive pandas into the wild. That research slowed after a few [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1702.32s)]
*  freed bears were found dead and as you're about to see, no Chinese scientists can afford to lose [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1710.24s)]
*  even one baby cute cat bear. Giant pandas have been chewing bamboo for about three million years, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1717.04s)]
*  but they were so elusive in the high mountains of China pandas weren't discovered by western [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1729.6s)]
*  naturalists until 1869. Today their fans know where to find them. Each morning humans compete [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1735.76s)]
*  for position at the Qingdu research base of giant panda breeding in central China. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1743.04s)]
*  A ticket is about eight bucks. Some days there are 100,000 visitors, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1750.96s)]
*  so yes that's $800,000 a day, but the experience is priceless. If these bears were in the wild, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1756.8s)]
*  they'd be rare and solitary. They would be in alpine forests as high as 13,000 feet, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1765.1200000000001s)]
*  and we saw about 30 feet up how they went unnoticed for so long. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1773.1200000000001s)]
*  At the research base, each bear is known by name, light online, and wrapped in the flag. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1779.12s)]
*  A selfie with China's national symbol is a tap of patriotism. When I'm out on the street and if [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1786.3999999999999s)]
*  anybody asks me about what I do, I tell them I work with giant pandas, they immediately [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1793.28s)]
*  look at me and say, oh, you're a giant panda. I'm a giant panda. I'm a giant panda. I'm a giant [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1799.6799999999998s)]
*  panda. They immediately thank me and then they follow it up with that is our national treasure. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1807.36s)]
*  Enriching the treasure is the work of Mark Vallituto, a wildlife veterinarian from the [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1813.36s)]
*  Smithsonian Institution in Washington on loan to the Qingdu research base. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1818.3999999999999s)]
*  So what we see here is actually a normal healthy panda lung and a normal healthy panda heart. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1825.76s)]
*  The Smithsonian has helped propagate pandas since China sent Richard Nixon home with a [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1834.48s)]
*  pair in 1972. Back then, China barely had two to spare. By the 1980s, there were only about [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1839.68s)]
*  1,200 left in China's bamboo forests, which humans were cutting down. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1849.1200000000001s)]
*  Is bamboo the only thing they eat? 99 percent of their diet in the wild is bamboo. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1856.0800000000002s)]
*  A forest is delivered every day to the Qingdu base. The common name panda means bamboo eater. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1861.12s)]
*  But because this member of the grass family is so low in nutrition, each bear spends up to 16 [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1871.6s)]
*  hours a day shredding 40 pounds of leaves and stems, and that is hardly enough to keep them alive. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1878.8799999999999s)]
*  So the rest of the day, the bears burn as few calories as possible. Even mating is incredibly rare. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1886.48s)]
*  Only once a year can a female be prepared for breeding, and that is within a very small three-day window. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1899.3600000000001s)]
*  A female panda is capable of breeding three days a year? Exactly, very small time. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1905.6s)]
*  A very small time for a very small bear. And how old are these cubs? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1912.96s)]
*  One month. Dr. Wu Kanju told us when these cubs are newborn, they average about four ounces, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1920.56s)]
*  the size of a stick of butter. And how many cubs do you bring into the world in a year? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1928.48s)]
*  This year is five babies. Of the five cubs that are born here this year, how many do you expect to survive? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1934.24s)]
*  About half the time pandas have twins, but the mother can't care for both. In the wild, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1950.08s)]
*  the smaller, the weaker twin will be left off to die because the mother doesn't have enough [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1956.8s)]
*  energy to produce the amount of milk that's required for two babies. But in captivity, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1962.16s)]
*  twins are fed in the nursery, and with a touch, mom is called to duty to nurse the twins one at a time [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1967.68s)]
*  so both survive. The cub's eyes won't open for about six weeks, so mother helps him to her breast, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1975.52s)]
*  and like every nursing mom, a change of position helps, especially when her back is killing her. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1982.8000000000002s)]
*  The cubs are dependent up to three years. She'll raise only five or maybe eight in her lifetime. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1990.72s)]
*  How big do they become? So the females can be up to maybe around 200 pounds, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=1997.84s)]
*  and the males up to 300 pounds. Why are they black and white? You know, as a very interesting [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2003.44s)]
*  question, it's a mechanism to protect themselves, like many, many other animals out there that are [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2009.2s)]
*  black and white or various different colors. It's camouflage? You know pandas love the snow. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2013.9199999999998s)]
*  So the white parts really help them hide in the snow, whereas the black would be presumptive of shadows. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2019.36s)]
*  The panda is a curious bear. In the last century, many biologists didn't think it belonged in the [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2028.32s)]
*  bear family. Pandas don't hibernate, and though they're virtual vegetarians, they have the [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2034.32s)]
*  digestive tract of a carnivore. Panda nutrition was a mystery when Dr. Hao Rong came here nearly [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2040.24s)]
*  30 years ago. She's director of research and told us that the base started as a shelter for [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2047.6s)]
*  injured pandas that had been rescued. There were very few pandas, she said. All of them were [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2054.64s)]
*  seriously ill, close to impossible to breed. We were also broke. I was the only scientist. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2064.24s)]
*  You had a dozen pandas. Yes. How many do you have now? Now it's 200. 200 healthy pandas have grown [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2071.76s)]
*  from the research into nutrition and understanding those fleeting female hormones. It's gone so well [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2080.88s)]
*  that a new area of research has opened, panda geriatrics. The bears live about 20 years in the [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2088.6400000000003s)]
*  wild, but up to 35 in the company of man. In 1937, a leading American naturalist described the giant [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2097.52s)]
*  panda as an extremely stupid beast, dull and primitive. But Mark Vallituto showed us pandas [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2106.56s)]
*  understand commands. The whistle signals something good is about to happen, generally involving [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2116.08s)]
*  apple slices. Then on cue, the bear volunteered its arm through the bars to a metal tray [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2123.76s)]
*  and gripped a handle. It's having a blood test. All of the pandas, the adult pandas here, are trained [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2131.76s)]
*  specifically to offer their arm for a blood sample. It really helps us as veterinary animals from [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2139.28s)]
*  having to be anesthetized and allows the animal to be an active participant in the process. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2145.76s)]
*  And allows the animal to be an active participant in their health. And that's it. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2151.76s)]
*  I've seen people throw a bigger fuss than he did. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2160.1600000000003s)]
*  They're incredibly complex creatures, just like many other bear species or carnivorous [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2164.7200000000003s)]
*  species like dogs and cats. Like dogs, pandas come at the sound of their name. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2170.0800000000004s)]
*  They know their day will start with apples and continue at the endless bamboo buffet. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2176.0s)]
*  But success in captivity does not necessarily mean salad days for the species. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2190.96s)]
*  To thrive genetically, they must come home to the wild. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2198.08s)]
*  This is really an exciting time because they're doing so well in captivity. And [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2202.32s)]
*  we can really consider them safe. That's not so for the wild populations. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2209.1200000000003s)]
*  Melissa Songer is a Smithsonian conservation biologist working at the foot of Mount Qingchong, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2213.84s)]
*  near the center of China. This is the Chengdu Field Research Center. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2220.7200000000003s)]
*  And most people know it as Panda Valley. And it was established for the purpose of preparing [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2226.08s)]
*  captive pandas for release into the wild. One of the amazing things that we saw is how well [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2232.7200000000003s)]
*  trained they are. But it strikes me that that's a blessing and a curse. They don't have the [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2238.56s)]
*  opportunity to learn how to find food or defend against predators. Even mating is very complex [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2243.36s)]
*  in the wild. So yes, they're highly trained, but they aren't really trained to be in the wild. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2248.48s)]
*  Then do you train them to be wild? And if so, how do you do that? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2253.92s)]
*  They're not going to be fed. They're going to have to move around and find food. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2258.16s)]
*  And taking it step by step, so acclimatizing them to a very different situation is an important [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2261.6800000000003s)]
*  phase before full release. Like sending the kids off to college. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2267.36s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. There are fewer than 2,000 wild pandas living in only three mountainous provinces [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2271.36s)]
*  of China. They're segregated into small groups cut off from one another by roads, farms and villages. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2278.64s)]
*  About half of those populations are less than 10 pandas. And so that kind of puts them at risk for [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2286.96s)]
*  losing genetic diversity. It puts them at risk for other events, natural disasters, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2293.12s)]
*  diseases that might come through. So it's a dangerous number. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2297.92s)]
*  To reduce the danger, two research bases are testing competing ideas. One from a research [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2302.48s)]
*  station called Wulong minimizes contact with people to the point of dressing the trainers [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2309.12s)]
*  in panda suits that are scented with panda urine so the bears don't even get a whiff of humanity. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2315.52s)]
*  The other approach encourages the human relationship in case a panda needs to be rescued. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2324.0s)]
*  While the bears walk on the wild side, they're monitored with radio collars [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2331.04s)]
*  in case they get into trouble. So far, 14 pandas have been released. Three have died. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2335.84s)]
*  But those few failures have slowed the research because if a panda is killed, it's not just some [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2343.36s)]
*  bear. It's a bear with a name and a million likes on its webpage. Anytime you release a captive animal [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2350.32s)]
*  to the wild, you're taking a risk. And you prepare as best you can, but there are things [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2358.16s)]
*  you can't really prepare for. One of the pandas who died was attacked by dogs. Another appears to [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2363.04s)]
*  have fallen from a tree. The captive-born pandas take longer to establish territory, but for the [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2369.7599999999998s)]
*  most part, they fit in. China says it will soon spend more than a billion dollars on a 10,000 [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2376.0s)]
*  square mile panda national reserve to connect those pockets of wild bears. It suggests that [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2384.32s)]
*  species can be saved. It absolutely does. But more than that, what's even better than the [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2393.36s)]
*  survivability of this species is that they are an umbrella species, meaning that the care that we [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2399.92s)]
*  provide for the pandas and the tracks of land that we preserve will also save a whole multitude of [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2405.92s)]
*  other species that also need our care that a lot of people don't even know about. Which raises a [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2415.1200000000003s)]
*  fair question. If a multitude of species is saved, if climate benefits from five million acres of [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2421.2000000000003s)]
*  forest reserve, are we saving the panda? Or is the panda saving us? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2429.2s)]
*  It's safe to say that wolves have an image problem. Since ancient times, they've been portrayed [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2445.6s)]
*  in fables and legends and the Bible as fearsome, voracious predators. The story of the big bad wolf [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2461.7599999999998s)]
*  may be the most memorable and frightening of all the fairy tales told by the Brothers Grimm. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2468.7999999999997s)]
*  That grim reputation actually produced a very real result in America in the early 20th century. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2474.48s)]
*  Wolves were wiped off the landscape, trapped, poisoned, and hunted until there was not a single [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2481.6s)]
*  one left in the American West. When the National Park Service decided to bring wolves back to [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2488.24s)]
*  Yellowstone Park in the 1990s, it followed a bitter debate between wildlife groups who wanted them [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2494.3199999999997s)]
*  restored and ranchers who most definitely didn't. Two decades later, the wolves of Yellowstone still [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2500.96s)]
*  stir strong emotions, but they've also had an impact that almost no one saw coming. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2508.8s)]
*  In the dead of winter, Yellowstone Park is a beautiful but forbidding place. Howling wind, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2517.2s)]
*  sub-zero temperatures, six feet of snow. Just finding enough food to survive is a profound [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2524.24s)]
*  struggle for every animal. Waterfowl, bison, elk, foxes, they all have to work for every morsel. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2531.2799999999997s)]
*  Yellowstone was the world's first national park founded in 1872 and it remains one of the most [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2543.4399999999996s)]
*  visited. Millions of people come here every summer, but they used to pretty much leave it [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2550.48s)]
*  to the wildlife in the winter until the wolves came back. Oh, they're behind the tree. Now, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2556.32s)]
*  reports of a wolf sighting can produce a traffic jam along the 150-mile stretch of road the Park [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2563.28s)]
*  Service keeps open in the winter. Oh, we got a wolf up moving. Oh, neat. Visitors with spotting [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2569.68s)]
*  scopes gather in absolutely frigid weather for a momentary long-distance view. Bill, these folks [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2575.6s)]
*  came from Germany to see wolves. How about that? Doug Smith runs the Yellowstone Wolf Research [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2582.88s)]
*  Program for the Park Service. And no one predicted this would happen. Actually, you know, we... The [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2588.16s)]
*  appeal of coming in to see the wolves? Yes, and it truly has been amazing and hundreds of thousands [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2594.96s)]
*  of people a year, we estimate, come here just to see wolves. Wolf tourism pumps $35 million a year [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2602.16s)]
*  into the local economy, much of it spent in the winter, which is prime wolf watching time. We've [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2611.52s)]
*  seen wolves all three days that we've been out. Glenn Mai is a retired FBI agent from Arlington, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2617.92s)]
*  Virginia. Kathy Lombard is a retired cop from New Hampshire. They both paid an outfitter [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2623.52s)]
*  thousands of dollars to take them wolf watching. So what is it about wolves that bring you all the [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2630.24s)]
*  way out here from New Hampshire to sit out here and just hope for the chance to see them? They've [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2637.12s)]
*  been able to bring wolves back into Yellowstone and they've thrived. So that's just an awesome [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2642.3999999999996s)]
*  thing to see. It was January 12, 1995, when the first gray wolves captured in Canada were carried [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2649.2799999999997s)]
*  into Yellowstone Park. It drew both national attention and fierce opposition, so much that [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2658.32s)]
*  armed guards were posted to protect those wolves. So the first wolves released into Yellowstone Park [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2666.4s)]
*  were released right back here in this thicket? Yes, so a total of 41 over three years. How many [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2673.76s)]
*  are in the park now? We've got 96 in 10 packs and it's been roughly 100 wolves the last 10 years. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2680.4s)]
*  Very stable. Those 10 packs of about 10 wolves each are without a doubt the most closely observed [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2688.32s)]
*  and studied wolves on earth. Our goal is to keep touch with each pack. That's our goal. They do that [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2696.1600000000003s)]
*  by trying to attach radio collars to at least two wolves in each of the park's packs. So you fly out [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2704.0800000000004s)]
*  in the airplane, find wolves in the open. That airplane radios a waiting helicopter on the ground. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2710.72s)]
*  That helicopter flies out with a gunner in the back seat. That gunner is almost always Smith himself. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2719.04s)]
*  And you fly up alongside that wolf and you shoot a tranquilizing dart into it. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2729.3599999999997s)]
*  Ducks in, ducks in. Five minutes it goes down. We process the wolves. We take blood. We measure them. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2736.08s)]
*  We look at their health and we attach a radio collar and then we follow them for their life hopefully. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2743.3599999999997s)]
*  That life by the way typically lasts about five years. Yellowstone wolves are fierce and territorial. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2749.6s)]
*  The leading cause of death is attacks from other wolves and their look is uncontrollable. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2757.84s)]
*  That look says I ain't going to conform to your rules and I'll die before I do and that's powerful. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2765.1200000000003s)]
*  That is a location of a wolf. Data from the radio collars has helped Smith's team to learn volumes [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2774.32s)]
*  about wolf behavior. Let me see where the boulder is by itself. Yeah it also helps all those wolf [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2780.7200000000003s)]
*  watchers find them. Park Service employee Rick McIntyre is out every day listening for signals. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2785.6s)]
*  So that is from a black male wolf 1107. And then spreading the word. Would you like to see a gray wolf? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2793.2s)]
*  Okay there you go. So it's a little bit right of center. Oh yeah. Oh look here comes a whole pack. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2801.6s)]
*  Wow. So see if you can count them all there would be two grays and six blacks. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2809.52s)]
*  Four, five, six black ones and the white one that went by. And there should be a second gray. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2815.7599999999998s)]
*  How about that? We had spotted the Junction Butte pack along a ridgeline about two miles away. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2821.9199999999996s)]
*  Like most packs it's led by an alpha male and an alpha female. The only two wolves in a pack who [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2830.16s)]
*  mate with each other. The gray alpha female is still leading to the right. Oh yeah. And you see [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2836.96s)]
*  how the ones behind her are playing. She's determined to lead them to the west. They're [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2843.28s)]
*  running along the top. Right along the ridge. Yeah. That's magnificent. We can see these wolves [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2849.04s)]
*  from the ground and it's been a sensation. So we've learned a lot about pack dynamics [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2855.68s)]
*  and personalities and how social they are. What do you mean? Describe that for me. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2862.16s)]
*  They want to be together. They're a pack animal. So the power of the wolf is the pack. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2869.04s)]
*  Nowhere is that power more evident than when a wolf pack is on the hunt for elk, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2877.68s)]
*  its favorite prey. They work together because they have to. Your average wolf weighs 100 pounds [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2882.96s)]
*  or so but your average prey animal is much bigger. A bull elk is 750 pounds, a cow elk is 500. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2889.84s)]
*  So how's a roughly 100 to 120 pound animal going to take that down? They do it, Doug Smith says, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2896.4s)]
*  both by coordinating their attack and by zeroing in on vulnerable prey. They're going to take the [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2903.44s)]
*  week. So they're making their living off of calf elk, old elk, injured elk. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2910.64s)]
*  Without wolves, there was an overpopulation of elk in Yellowstone. As wolves have cut the size of [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2918.64s)]
*  those herds, there's been an unexpected side effect. Plants that elk feed on have made a [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2924.72s)]
*  comeback, which has in turn produced benefits for other species. All the little trees have come back [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2930.48s)]
*  since wolf recovery. This gully filled with shrubs has all come back since wolf recovery. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2938.08s)]
*  And the wolves are a factor in all of that? Very simply put, wolves eat elk, elk eat this. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2944.8s)]
*  When the elk get reduced, they eat less. So beavers and songbirds can respond to the growth in that [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2952.8s)]
*  vegetation. Doug Smith is quick to say that it's not as simple as he just made it sound. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2959.36s)]
*  But that hasn't stopped some environmentalists from declaring wolves the saviors of Yellowstone's [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2965.36s)]
*  ecology. There's some people who will try to convince you that wolves could probably [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2971.2000000000003s)]
*  solve many peace and world hunger. Randy Newberg is a Montana hunter who hosts a TV show and podcast [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2977.04s)]
*  for hunters. He remembers how emotional the debate over reintroduction was between wolf haters and [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2984.48s)]
*  wolf lovers. Wolves are wolves. They aren't the big bad wolf and they don't have a rainbow shooting [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2991.76s)]
*  out their ass like everyone would think they do. There's something romantic about a wolf, right? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=2997.36s)]
*  Unless you've seen it chewing on a live cow. Eric Kostas' family has been raising cattle and [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3004.32s)]
*  sheep on this Montana ranch for 100 years. He says he was worried from the moment the first [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3011.76s)]
*  wolves were brought back to Yellowstone, which is about 100 miles to the south. You know, they [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3018.96s)]
*  weren't going to stay in the park. They're a wild animal. They'd go where they want to go. I'm sure [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3024.8s)]
*  you knew it was only a matter of time before they were going to get here. Oh yes, there was no doubt [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3029.76s)]
*  and there was a set of tracks. Eric Kosta knew that wolves would follow migrating elk out of [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3035.28s)]
*  Yellowstone and onto his ranch and that they'd attack his livestock if given the chance. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3041.04s)]
*  He started hiring range riders to watch over his cattle and he bought guard dogs to help keep [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3047.04s)]
*  wolves away from his sheep. Live sheep pay for things. Live cattle pay for things. Dead ones don't. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3053.1200000000003s)]
*  His defensive measures have kept wolves away from his livestock, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3060.4s)]
*  but neighboring ranchers have lost both cattle and sheep to wolves. The thing that's never [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3064.6400000000003s)]
*  monitored when I talk to these people is the lost nights of sleep, the nervousness. I saw a wolf [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3070.24s)]
*  track on my place today or I actually saw a wolf. Wolves are around. You can't measure or compensate [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3077.8399999999997s)]
*  for that. Are wolf attacks on livestock a serious problem? No, it's rare that it happens, but if [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3083.12s)]
*  it's happening to you it's a serious problem. It was that fear of wolf attacks that drove ranchers [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3090.56s)]
*  and settlers to eradicate them in the early 20th century. After the Endangered Species Act was [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3096.8s)]
*  passed in 1973, wolves were among the first to be listed and a campaign began to restore them to [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3103.2000000000003s)]
*  Yellowstone Park. After that happened in the 90s, wolves quickly spread out of Yellowstone and into [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3110.96s)]
*  neighboring states. So many that there are now nearly 2,000 in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3118.32s)]
*  After a long and bitter legal battle, those states finally won the authority to manage [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3126.48s)]
*  and sometimes kill wolves outside the National Park. Has this management of the wolves helped to [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3132.7200000000003s)]
*  lessen some of those passions, to calm some of those emotions? I think so. So to have wolves, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3141.6800000000003s)]
*  you have to kill the wolves? In some situations, yes. The first situation is cut and dried. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8wi8PIVXQA&t=3149.2000000000003s)]
