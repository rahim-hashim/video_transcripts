# World’s Most Interesting Places: Vol. 3 | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [May 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew)
*  On this Easter Sunday, we thought it would be fitting to take you on a journey to Easter [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=0.0s)]
*  Island. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=17.76s)]
*  It's one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world, far into the Pacific, 2200 miles [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=18.76s)]
*  due west from the coast of Chile. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=24.68s)]
*  Dutch explorers gave it its name after they spotted it on Easter Sunday in 1722. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=27.32s)]
*  What they found has fascinated and confounded the world ever since. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=33.44s)]
*  Giant stone statues, the tower over the island's landscape. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=37.84s)]
*  They're called Moai, and as we learned our first morning on Easter Island, there's nothing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=42.08s)]
*  quite like them anywhere else in the world. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=47.28s)]
*  When dawn breaks on Easter Island, it is the Moai that first feel the sun. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=52.66s)]
*  These 15 Moai at a site called Tangariki are perhaps the most famous. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=58.059999999999995s)]
*  Carved out of volcanic rock, they're placed on a stone platform called an Ahu. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  The tallest is nearly 30 feet. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=68.34s)]
*  They stand, strange, silent sentinels, facing away from the sea, watching over the land [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=70.78s)]
*  and its people. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=77.38s)]
*  At least a thousand Moai can be found scattered across this island, which is about the size [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=79.06s)]
*  of Washington, D.C. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=84.0s)]
*  Many more Moai remain buried underground. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=85.86s)]
*  To the descendants of those who built them, these are more than statues made of stone. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  They are immortal branches of an ancient family tree. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=94.10000000000001s)]
*  The Moai represents an ancestor, and we believe in ancestor that goes beyond this life, but [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=98.2s)]
*  is helping us, guiding you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=106.5s)]
*  Is a Moai a distinct individual ancestor, or can it also be the family line of that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=109.42s)]
*  ancestor? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  Both. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=116.89999999999999s)]
*  Pedro Edmonds-Pauoa is the longtime mayor of the only town on Easter Island. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  So when you see the Moai today, it's not just something from the past, it's something that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=122.96s)]
*  is alive, that has power right now. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=127.69999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=130.34s)]
*  We indigenous people from this island believe in that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=131.34s)]
*  The indigenous people here believe their ancestors and family lines are represented [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=135.22s)]
*  by specific groups of Moai. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=140.04s)]
*  Mayor Edmonds-Pauoa says his are at a site called Tahai. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=142.54s)]
*  My genealogy traces all the way to that site 85 times. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=146.54s)]
*  It goes back that far? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=151.18s)]
*  Yes, more than a thousand years. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=152.5s)]
*  That is entirely possible. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=155.16s)]
*  No one knows for sure the exact date the first people came here, but it's believed to have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=157.06s)]
*  been somewhere around 800 to 1200 years ago. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=161.78s)]
*  Archaeological evidence indicates they sailed from an unknown island in Polynesia, a dangerous [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=165.7s)]
*  journey across more than a thousand miles of open ocean. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  Those first settlers brought with them their tradition of carving, but they made much smaller [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=175.78s)]
*  statues. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=180.17999999999998s)]
*  They also brought a belief in a mystical force called mana. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=181.22s)]
*  How do you describe mana? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=185.29999999999998s)]
*  What is mana? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=186.73999999999998s)]
*  Mana is beyond description. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=187.74s)]
*  If we were to describe it in today's language, it's knowledge. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  Knowledge. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=195.74s)]
*  We interpret it as wisdom, as an energy that gives you strength. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=196.74s)]
*  Do the Moai still have mana? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=202.06s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=204.02s)]
*  It has soul. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=205.02s)]
*  It has life. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=206.02s)]
*  They're alive? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=207.02s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=208.02s)]
*  According to legend, when important islanders died, their mana flowed out of their bodies [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=209.02s)]
*  into the Moai. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=214.82000000000002s)]
*  The mana is here. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=216.62s)]
*  The mana is here. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=218.22s)]
*  It's a hard concept for my small mind to imagine. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=219.5s)]
*  For a human like you guys from the city don't understand these things because you worry [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=222.78s)]
*  about working like disciplined animals. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=227.38s)]
*  Those who believe in mana say it's not just in the Moai, it can be found in everything [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=232.66s)]
*  here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=237.9s)]
*  In the waves that constantly crash ashore, in the rocky soil and in the green grass that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=238.9s)]
*  blankets the island. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=244.7s)]
*  These objects in the middle of what looks like a barren landscape, they speak to you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=246.62s)]
*  They draw you in. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=251.14s)]
*  They make you want to know more. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=252.14s)]
*  I think that that's the power of them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=255.54s)]
*  And when you see how tall they really are... [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=257.65999999999997s)]
*  Joanne Van Tilburg is a UCLA professor of archeology. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=259.82s)]
*  She's been coming here for nearly 40 years, working with local researchers and artists, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=263.5s)]
*  excavating and cataloging the statues, trying to understand the mysteries and what she calls [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=269.06s)]
*  the magic of the Moai. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=274.18s)]
*  They're tight-lipped, these statues. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=276.22s)]
*  They don't give up their secrets easily. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=278.22s)]
*  And they don't give them up to outsiders easily. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=281.22s)]
*  To learn the Moai's secrets, you have to start where nearly all of them were made. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=284.1s)]
*  Around the vent of a dormant volcano, this is the ancient quarry of Rana Raraku. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=288.98s)]
*  There are some 400 Moai here, more than in any other spot on the island. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=294.42s)]
*  The largest one, never raised upright, is almost 70 feet long and weighs at least 250 tons, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  as heavy as some passenger jets. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=307.46000000000004s)]
*  Based on excavations Joanne Van Tilburg and other archaeologists have done, an analysis [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=310.14s)]
*  of soil samples and objects found around the statues, Van Tilburg believes the height of [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=315.26s)]
*  Moai construction was around 1300 to the mid 1400s, though Moai did continue to be carved [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=320.66s)]
*  until, or just after, their first contact with Europeans in 1722. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=327.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean is it not possible with carbon dating or other scientific techniques to know exactly [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=333.26000000000005s)]
*  when something was made? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=338.38s)]
*  Unfortunately not. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=339.38s)]
*  You can't date stone, this stone, in that manner. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=340.38s)]
*  When the first archaeological survey was done on the island in 1914, all the Moai, except [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=344.14000000000004s)]
*  those in the quarry, were found lying on the ground. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=349.38s)]
*  There are several plausible theories how they got there. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=352.70000000000005s)]
*  Some statues may have simply fallen from neglect, others were knocked over in earthquakes, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=355.74s)]
*  and some were intentionally toppled during fighting between competing family groups. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=361.14s)]
*  Today, some Moai are only partially visible, just their famous faces stick out of the ground. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=365.98s)]
*  The rest of their bodies are buried under sediment that's naturally built up over the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=372.06s)]
*  centuries. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=376.3s)]
*  This one is at least only about one third above ground. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=377.58s)]
*  Wow, so two thirds of these are actually below ground? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=380.7s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=383.3s)]
*  At first glance, the Moai all look alike, but Van Tilburg says no two are the same. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=384.3s)]
*  How are they different? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=390.5s)]
*  Well, they're different in the line of their mouth, they're different in of course their [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=391.5s)]
*  size and shape, they're different in their expressions, whether their head is tilted [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=394.3s)]
*  up or lowered slightly or to the side. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=398.24s)]
*  These two Moai, they're unfinished? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=400.54s)]
*  They're unfinished. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=402.74s)]
*  Visitors here have long debated how the Moai were made, given the stone age conditions [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=403.74s)]
*  on the island when the statues were being carved. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=408.7s)]
*  Van Tilburg says the answer is all around. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=411.65999999999997s)]
*  There are thousands of stone carving tools scattered throughout the quarry. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=414.82s)]
*  This was a hand held instrument that was used and if you hold it you can actually feel where [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=418.74s)]
*  people may have put their fingers, which was actually used to rough out the sculpture. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=422.7s)]
*  You can actually feel the sort of the hand? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=427.18s)]
*  Yeah, you can. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=429.09999999999997s)]
*  Wow, that's amazing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=430.09999999999997s)]
*  Isn't that cool? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=431.09999999999997s)]
*  This was literally just laying ten feet away. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=432.09999999999997s)]
*  And you put it in your hand and you can feel where the other person's hand was who actually [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=433.94s)]
*  used this. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=437.5s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=438.5s)]
*  History and magic, that's it right there. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=439.5s)]
*  But magic alone couldn't move the Moai from the quarry to sites on the coast, in some [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=441.86s)]
*  cases more than eight miles away. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=446.54s)]
*  That took muscle and ingenuity. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=449.2s)]
*  Van Tilburg has tested a theory she believes, that Moai were placed horizontally on sleds [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=452.06s)]
*  and dragged over logs. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=457.94s)]
*  Island legend says the statues walked and some archaeologists have tested that theory [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=463.9s)]
*  as well. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=468.18s)]

*  You may have also heard an out of this world theory about space aliens making and moving [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=473.78s)]
*  the Moai. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=478.62s)]
*  It may sound ridiculous, but it's still believed by many visitors today. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=479.62s)]
*  You must have people asking you about extraterrestrials building these. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=484.6s)]
*  Yes, yes I do. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=488.78s)]
*  So I just have to ask, any possibility of that? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=489.9s)]
*  You don't believe it though? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=493.46s)]
*  No, I don't believe it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=495.5s)]
*  Easter Island was annexed by Chile in 1888. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=499.26s)]
*  Half of the 8,000 people who now live here are Chilean immigrants. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=502.66s)]
*  The other half are modern descendants of those original Polynesian settlers. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=506.7s)]
*  They call themselves and the island Rapa Nui. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=511.42s)]
*  In 2017 Chile finally gave them control of the National Park where the Moai and other [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=515.14s)]
*  important archaeological sites are located. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=520.54s)]
*  The park covers more than 40% of the island. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=523.58s)]
*  The island of Rapa Nui was formed out of volcanic rock starting some 3 million years [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=527.42s)]
*  ago. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=532.06s)]
*  There are now three dormant volcanoes that dominate the landscape. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=533.06s)]
*  This one is called Rano Kau. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=536.38s)]
*  No one knows exactly how many archaeological sites there are on the island, but this place [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=538.3399999999999s)]
*  is like a living museum, constantly battered by the sun, the wind and the rain. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=542.54s)]
*  Those three elements are over time destroying the Moai. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=549.38s)]
*  These statues may look as though they're solid stone, but they're actually quite porous. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=553.3s)]
*  Joanne Van Tilburg showed us a small piece of the soft volcanic rock called tuff that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=558.02s)]
*  the Moai are made from. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=563.14s)]
*  Tuff has really special qualities where it can be carved and it can be polished quite [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=565.06s)]
*  easily. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=568.78s)]
*  It's good for sculpting because with a harder stone it's able to be chipped away easily. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=569.78s)]
*  Correct. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=573.9799999999999s)]
*  So the very material which made these statues possible also long term makes them very vulnerable. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=574.9799999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=582.54s)]
*  Rainwater and airborne seeds get into the pores of tuff, gradually breaking it apart. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=583.54s)]
*  The wind whittles the stone away over time and further damage is done by birds and a [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=589.26s)]
*  type of algae called lichen. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=594.54s)]
*  Some Moai are in worse condition than others. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=597.06s)]
*  Take a look at this one called Tukuturi. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=599.62s)]
*  This photograph is from 1955 when it was unearthed. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=602.06s)]
*  This is how Tukuturi looks today. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=605.78s)]
*  The stone breaks very easily. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=608.62s)]
*  It is just not stable. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=609.98s)]
*  Essentially they're dissolving. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=611.7s)]
*  Yeah, they are. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=613.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean, if they're standing out in the rain they're melting like sugar cubes. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=614.4200000000001s)]
*  Like sugar cubes in the rain. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=617.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=618.74s)]
*  It's that dramatic. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=619.74s)]
*  In the 1990s, with help from the Japanese government, the 15 Moai at Tongarii, which [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=620.74s)]
*  had fallen or been toppled over, were reconstructed along with the stone platform they now stand [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=625.86s)]
*  on. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=631.5s)]
*  The UN has declared Easter Island a World Heritage Site and efforts to slow the disintegration [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=632.7s)]
*  of the statues with a chemical sealant have been underway for decades. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=638.06s)]
*  But so far only about 20 Moai have been treated. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=642.14s)]
*  The process is expensive, money the island doesn't have. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=646.06s)]
*  It's also not a permanent solution. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=649.9799999999999s)]
*  The sealant only delays the inevitable. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=652.42s)]
*  One day these Moai will likely disappear. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=655.0999999999999s)]
*  Is there a plan, a conservation plan, an environmental plan for long term in the future? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=658.06s)]
*  No. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=663.5s)]
*  There's not? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=664.5s)]
*  None. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=665.5s)]
*  None at all. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=666.5s)]
*  Mayor Pedro Edmonds' powoha is frustrated. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=668.38s)]
*  There's a lack of consensus among the Rapa Nui about how to preserve the Moai. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=671.14s)]
*  And the island's infrastructure is under pressure from all the tourists who want to [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=676.26s)]
*  come see the statues. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=680.18s)]
*  A few decades ago there were only two incoming flights a week. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=681.98s)]
*  Now there are two almost every day. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=687.62s)]
*  Cruise ships also make regular calls. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=691.58s)]
*  Just long enough for passengers to get off the boat. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=694.04s)]
*  Grab some souvenirs and snap a few selfies. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=697.62s)]
*  In all, 120,000 tourists visited last year. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=702.34s)]
*  That's too much. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=706.3s)]
*  If tourism continues to grow, is that sustainable here? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=707.46s)]
*  No, it's not sustainable. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=710.82s)]
*  Christian Moreno-Pacarati is a historian who earns his living training tour guides. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=713.22s)]
*  Do you have concerns about the impact of tourism? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=718.38s)]
*  So in material terms, the community has never been better. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=721.1s)]
*  But in general, it's much less friendly than it was some time ago. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=725.62s)]
*  He says the more the island caters to tourists, the less like home it is for the people whose [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=731.1s)]
*  ancestors built the Moai. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=735.66s)]
*  Today we are kind of forced to see the statues from far away, just like the tourists that [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=737.86s)]
*  come here. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=742.14s)]
*  People of my generation, right? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=743.14s)]
*  We could go there and touch the statues. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=745.14s)]
*  And be part of the statues and hug the statues. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=748.62s)]
*  How can I explain to my son today that my son cannot do that? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=751.5s)]
*  Despite no longer being able to touch them, he still feels the same sense of wonder he's [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=757.58s)]
*  always experienced when visiting the Moai. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=762.44s)]
*  You've been here probably thousands of times. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=765.26s)]
*  Thousands of times, yeah. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=767.3s)]
*  No, it's still awesome. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=768.3s)]
*  It's something that you still feel awe when you're here. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=770.22s)]
*  Christian Moreno-Pacarati supports the efforts to preserve the Moai, but believes it'll take [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=773.42s)]
*  more than mana and money. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=778.5s)]
*  He has his own somewhat radical idea on how to ensure the Moai keep standing. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=780.22s)]
*  The only way to keep them alive is to keep alive the art of making and moving statues. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=785.98s)]
*  So you would like to see the people of Rapa Nui making new Moai? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=792.86s)]
*  That's right, because these will disappear one day. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=797.02s)]
*  So if the art of making them is still alive, we will never lose the statues. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=799.66s)]
*  If you have ever taken a vacation to Italy, chances are you've been to Florence or Venice [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=806.42s)]
*  or Rome. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=824.8199999999999s)]
*  It's unlikely you've been to a place called Cremona, a small city with a rich heritage. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=825.8199999999999s)]
*  It's home to one of mankind's most glorious and coveted creations, elegant, handcrafted [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=832.62s)]
*  Stradivarius violins. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=838.1s)]
*  Cremona was home to the master himself, Antonio Stradivari, who carved stringed instruments [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=840.7s)]
*  out of raw wood and set the standard for a vibrant musical tradition that still flourishes [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=846.48s)]
*  today. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=853.02s)]
*  The time seems to stand still in the small northern Italian city of Cremona. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=860.18s)]
*  It's a quiet place, almost sleepy. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=864.2199999999999s)]
*  It moves to the rhythms of pedals and pedestrians. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=866.98s)]
*  But to understand the culture of Cremona, you have to listen. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=870.8199999999999s)]
*  Scientists believe the violin was invented here. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=884.98s)]
*  To an audience of schoolchildren in a Cremona concert hall, Ukrainian musician Anastasia [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=887.74s)]
*  Petreschak plays a violin made 300 years ago by the most famous violin maker in history, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=893.4200000000001s)]
*  Antonio Stradivari. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=901.0600000000001s)]
*  He plied, many would say perfected, the craft of violin making in Cremona in the 17th and [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=903.1800000000001s)]
*  18th centuries. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=909.22s)]
*  There are tributes to him all over town. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=911.26s)]
*  The city's violin museum pays homage to Stradivari and his magnificent creations. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=914.26s)]
*  And they are really our history. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=920.74s)]
*  Paolo Bodini, a doctor, the former mayor of Cremona and a director of the museum, took [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=922.26s)]
*  us on a tour of what he calls the treasure box. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=927.84s)]
*  So Paolo, these four all by Stradivari? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=932.22s)]
*  Yes, we're in the middle of the Stradivari world. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=934.82s)]
*  You live with these all the time. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=937.94s)]
*  Is it possible you have a favorite? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=940.58s)]
*  I would say the 1715 is my favorite as far as the sound. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=944.02s)]
*  Many of Stradivari's 1,100 instruments have decayed or disappeared over the years. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=950.06s)]
*  But a number that survived are in remarkable condition and in great demand by musicians [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=955.86s)]
*  all over the world. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=961.9s)]
*  Cremona's creations have been exported worldwide. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=963.7s)]
*  Here at a Stradfest in Los Angeles, an event almost as rare as the instruments, not one [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=975.3000000000001s)]
*  but several Stradivarius violins on stage together. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=981.62s)]
*  These world-class violinists played second fiddle to the old master. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=986.38s)]
*  Cremona has brought many of Stradivarius violins back home. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=993.7s)]
*  There are older instruments from Cremona here too, some made by the Guarneri family, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1010.26s)]
*  and this one made in 1566 by the man credited with inventing the violin, Andrea Amati. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1015.98s)]
*  This could be played today and would still have that exquisite sound? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1024.18s)]
*  This one is sort of a deep sound. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1029.54s)]
*  To nurture that sound, these delicate old instruments must be handled, held, played [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1033.02s)]
*  every month or two. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1040.3600000000001s)]
*  They're not just museum pieces. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1041.9s)]
*  If you want to keep them in shape, you have to play it quite often, but once in a while [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1043.9s)]
*  they need to vibrate to be kept alive. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1049.1000000000001s)]
*  And when these exquisite, valuable instruments are taken from their cases to be played by [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1052.8200000000002s)]
*  Anastasia Petreschak, they get armored car-type security. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1057.42s)]
*  It's a measure of their timeless power and versatility. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1062.3000000000002s)]
*  In Anastasia's hands, the 300-year-old Strad is just as adept playing a serene passage [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1065.98s)]
*  from Paganini as a gypsy melody by a Spanish composer. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1072.18s)]
*  I don't need something better because there isn't something better. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1095.3s)]
*  Zitzach Perlman, one of today's most celebrated violinists, plays only a Strad, though he [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1102.16s)]
*  has a more humble name for his, a fiddle. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1107.92s)]
*  This fiddle is so amazing, I don't have to worry about it. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1117.74s)]
*  You call it the perfect violin. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1120.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, it's the violin of my dreams. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1122.1200000000001s)]
*  If you want to play a pianissimo that is almost inaudible and yet it carries through a hall [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1124.52s)]
*  that seats 3,000 people, there is your Strad. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1131.32s)]
*  So describe the sound produced by this Stradivarius. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1135.52s)]
*  I can actually see the sound in my head. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1139.68s)]
*  I can actually see it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1142.88s)]
*  It has silk. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1145.48s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1147.44s)]
*  It's so difficult to describe, but each sound is different. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1150.3s)]
*  So this one has that sparkle. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1153.8s)]
*  There's a sparkle to the sound. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1157.72s)]
*  Somebody said it's just the Cremona magic. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1160.08s)]
*  Could be. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1163.6799999999998s)]
*  It could be the DNA of the city. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1164.6799999999998s)]
*  In almost any other Italian city, a medieval piazza and cathedral this magnificent would [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1167.76s)]
*  be crawling with foreign tourists. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1173.36s)]
*  But Cremona is off the beaten path. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1175.84s)]
*  It doesn't draw many visitors. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1178.0s)]
*  But don't mistake it for some charming music box time has forgotten. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1180.1999999999998s)]
*  Cremona actually is a very international city where the past and present coexist quite [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1184.68s)]
*  harmoniously. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1190.5600000000002s)]
*  Thousands of violins still are made here every year. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1194.8400000000001s)]
*  There seem to be more violin shops than espresso shops in Cremona. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1198.24s)]
*  There are 150 of them. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1202.1200000000001s)]
*  Stefano Cognia came here from Hungary more than 40 years ago. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1204.72s)]
*  Edgar Rusk moved from Austria and makes violins, violas and violoncelloes. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1209.32s)]
*  Matthias Heiliger came from Holland. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1215.2s)]
*  He says he and all the other violin makers were drawn by Cremona's history and tradition. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1218.08s)]
*  Do you feel the old master when you're walking through these streets? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1224.6s)]
*  Well, yes. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1228.6s)]
*  It's a matter of realizing that the man who made all those incredible instruments that [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1230.2s)]
*  we are admiring every day and we're listening at in the concert halls were made by a man [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1234.9599999999998s)]
*  that actually walked on the street here because the streets haven't changed, the houses haven't [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1240.28s)]
*  changed. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1245.0s)]
*  Neither has the way Matthias Heiliger's and the other craftsmen make their violins. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1246.36s)]
*  About the only thing that has changed in the past 500 years, workshops today have electric [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1251.6399999999999s)]
*  lights. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1257.28s)]
*  The violin makers use compasses, hand saws, glue, no nails. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1258.28s)]
*  The tools are simple, the craftsmanship precise. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1263.32s)]
*  This is the way Stradivari did it. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1267.16s)]
*  300 years ago he was sitting in the same town doing the same job. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1268.72s)]
*  Same way. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1272.92s)]
*  Same way, absolutely. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1273.92s)]
*  No power tools, no big technology. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1275.6s)]
*  How do you decide what piece of wood to use? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1279.6s)]
*  That is very much a matter of sound. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1286.28s)]
*  If you listen to this one for instance. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1288.36s)]
*  You can hear it. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1290.36s)]
*  What are you listening for? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1296.36s)]
*  That's the note this blade has. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1298.36s)]
*  It has a kind of clear resonance note. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1302.36s)]
*  This violin is going to have a clear sound. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1306.36s)]
*  Can I hear? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1309.36s)]
*  It's kind of high but it's clear in color. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1311.3999999999999s)]
*  Not so dark. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1317.3999999999999s)]
*  The violin makers of Cremona have used wood from the very same forests for hundreds of [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1319.3999999999999s)]
*  years. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1326.3999999999999s)]
*  Maple from Bosnia and red spruce from this one valley in the Italian Dolomites. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1327.3999999999999s)]
*  It's said Stradivari first discovered the acoustic qualities of these woods. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1333.3999999999999s)]
*  Now visitors show up every year to honor the trees and Italy being Italy there's a violinist [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1338.44s)]
*  to play a concert. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1345.44s)]
*  Not for the spectators, for the trees. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1347.44s)]
*  The material needs to be cut in the right place but also the right way. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1360.44s)]
*  We need to have the right moon and the right air humidity and the right wind when we cut [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1364.48s)]
*  the tree in the right season. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1369.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1371.48s)]
*  Is anyone today making violins as good as the old masters in Cremona? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1373.48s)]
*  I don't think so but I hope somebody proves me wrong. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1378.48s)]
*  That would be great. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1383.48s)]
*  300 years we're talking about and people still want to have a Stradivarius. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1384.48s)]
*  What is it? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1389.48s)]
*  What is it? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1390.48s)]
*  There is nothing like a fine Italian sound. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1391.52s)]
*  That's the magic. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1394.52s)]
*  There are only about 650 of Stradivarius creations still in existence. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1400.52s)]
*  The old instruments from Cremona are so rare and beautiful they've ignited a kind of feeding [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1405.52s)]
*  frenzy. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1411.52s)]
*  Sotheby's has this very rare Stradivarius viola up for sale and says it's worth $45 [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1412.56s)]
*  million. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1417.56s)]
*  No takers yet. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1418.56s)]
*  But Stradivarius violins have fetched as much as $16 million, snapped up by collectors [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1423.56s)]
*  and investors. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1428.56s)]
*  Could you afford your violin today? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1430.56s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1433.56s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1435.56s)]
*  Would you be willing to pay for it? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1437.56s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1439.6s)]
*  Would you ever sell your violin? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1441.6s)]
*  Right now? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1443.6s)]
*  The way it feels? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1444.6s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1447.6s)]
*  No. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1449.6s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1450.6s)]
*  Musicians lucky enough to have an old Cremona instrument like to play them as often as [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1456.6s)]
*  possible. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1461.6s)]
*  But being played decade after decade for centuries can be rough on old bodies and joints. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1462.6399999999999s)]
*  I wish you could talk. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1469.6399999999999s)]
*  Bruce Carlson, born in Michigan, has been restoring violins in Cremona for 40 years. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1470.6399999999999s)]
*  He has to take them apart to fix them. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1476.6399999999999s)]
*  Once we're all the way around, then we can slip the table off. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1479.6399999999999s)]
*  He did this to a Stradivarius that literally had fallen apart in a violinist's hands. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1483.6399999999999s)]
*  What is that like to pry open a violin made by Stradivarius? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1489.68s)]
*  I'd be scared to death to try to open that thing. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1495.68s)]
*  It may be something like a surgeon, you know, when he's operating. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1497.68s)]
*  Can't think about too much about the human side of things as to just getting on with the business and doing it. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1501.68s)]
*  Bruce Carlson learned his craft at this school in Cremona. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1508.68s)]
*  Students from all over the world come here to learn to make violins in the way of the old masters. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1513.72s)]
*  Chris Kurz dropped out of Penn State to study here. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1520.72s)]
*  It took him a year to make his first instrument. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1523.72s)]
*  What can you get in Cremona that you couldn't get, say, if you studied at Penn State or went to New York? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1526.72s)]
*  I mean, like, I can walk down the street and walk by three or four shops on my way to get a coffee. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1531.72s)]
*  And the fact that I can bring my instrument along to any one of those people and walk in and say, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1539.76s)]
*  hey, Meister, do you have a minute or two to look at what I'm doing? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1546.76s)]
*  And then they give me their inputs. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1549.76s)]
*  The city of violins. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1551.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It's like living, breathing right here in Cremona. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1552.76s)]
*  Living, breathing here on the stage of the city's Grand Old Hall, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1562.76s)]
*  a 21st century chamber orchestra featuring a 300-year-old Stradivarius. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1567.8s)]
*  It's a tradition, a sound, a gift from Cremona. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1573.8s)]
*  You have heard of Pompeii, the ancient Roman city destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1597.8s)]
*  Less well known is the neighboring city of Herculaneum, also buried by the volcano. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1604.8s)]
*  When the city was rediscovered in the 1700s, excavators found what could be the richest repository of ancient western wisdom, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1610.8s)]
*  a library filled with papyrus scrolls. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1619.8s)]
*  Scholars think there could be unknown Greek and Latin masterpieces, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1622.84s)]
*  possibly early Christian writings, even the first references to Jesus. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1627.84s)]
*  The problem is the volcanic heat left the scrolls so charred and brittle, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1632.84s)]
*  no one has been able to open them without breaking them into pieces. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1637.84s)]
*  We heard three scholars might finally have found a way to unravel the mystery of the scrolls. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1642.84s)]
*  So we traveled to Italy to see what we could uncover about the scrolls of Herculaneum. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1647.8799999999999s)]
*  The Italian city of Ercolano sits along the Bay of Naples on the western slope of Mount Vesuvius. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1652.8799999999999s)]
*  The city bustles with the chaos of Italian traffic and the easy flow of Italian life. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1657.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not a wealthy place, but it's a place where you can find a lot of things. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1662.8799999999999s)]
*  The city is a place where you can find a lot of things. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1667.8799999999999s)]
*  And the easy flow of Italian life. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1672.92s)]
*  It's not a wealthy place, but beneath these narrow streets lies buried treasure, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1675.92s)]
*  the ancient Roman seaside town of Herculaneum, entombed along with Pompeii in 79 AD. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1681.92s)]
*  The modern city is built on top of the ancient city. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1689.92s)]
*  There's no archaeological site in the world that matches this. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1694.92s)]
*  We went to Herculaneum with Andrew Wallace Hadrill, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1697.96s)]
*  founding director of the Herculaneum Conservation Project. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1701.96s)]
*  He showed us around the excavation site in all its ghostly grandeur. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1705.96s)]
*  So what do you think is going on here? Were they trying to escape or were they hiding? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1710.96s)]
*  In my view, they're not trying to get away by sea. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1716.96s)]
*  They're simply trying to take shelter under these folds. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1720.96s)]
*  Vesuvius blasted the town with successive massive surges of heat and ash for 24 hours. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1724.0s)]
*  Those surges, they kill all human life and all other forms of life, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1731.0s)]
*  and then wave after wave they begin to build up these layers of ash that compacts into rock. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1736.0s)]
*  Until we have this. 80 feet. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1744.0s)]
*  80 foot of solid rock. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1747.0s)]
*  That ended up preserving this place so well. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1749.04s)]
*  The paradox is that catastrophic destruction is also exceptionally good preservation. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1753.04s)]
*  Preserving Herculaneum like a fossil in amber. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1761.04s)]
*  Everything frozen in time, forgotten for nearly 17 centuries. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1765.04s)]
*  Until, legend has it, a farmer digging a well struck the past. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1770.04s)]
*  They've built a really big public building here. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1776.08s)]
*  Hadrill told us Herculaneum was like the Malibu of the Roman Empire, oasis for the elite. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1779.08s)]
*  Early excavators discovered this once opulent villa. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1786.08s)]
*  Today it looks like a cave. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1791.08s)]
*  In 79 AD, it looked like this. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1794.08s)]
*  The Getty Villa in Malibu, California is a recreation of the summer retreat [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1798.08s)]
*  thought to belong to the family of Julius Caesar. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1804.12s)]
*  Tunneling around in the ancient villa in Italy, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1808.12s)]
*  early treasure hunters dug out statues and riches enough to fill a grand room in the Naples Museum. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1812.12s)]
*  But the greatest treasures don't look valuable at all. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1820.12s)]
*  These are the papyrus scrolls of Herculaneum. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1824.12s)]
*  The collection of the ancient library includes 1,800 ancient books [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1828.1599999999999s)]
*  written on sheets of plant fiber, flash seared by the volcanic heat, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1833.1599999999999s)]
*  found in the only remaining intact library from the ancient world. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1838.1599999999999s)]
*  So where was the library? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1843.1599999999999s)]
*  The library was there. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1845.1599999999999s)]
*  The precarious villa excavation site is off limits to the public, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1846.1599999999999s)]
*  but Massimo Osana, former administrator of Herculaneum and Pompeii, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1851.1599999999999s)]
*  is still inside. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1856.2s)]
*  The library itself has not been excavated like this? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1858.2s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1861.2s)]
*  He said there could be hundreds more scrolls yet to be unearthed back in here, in the library. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1862.2s)]
*  It is a possibility. Maybe Aristotle. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1869.2s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1873.2s)]
*  Aristotle? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1874.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1875.2s)]
*  Euripides? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1876.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1877.2s)]
*  Virgil? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1878.2s)]
*  For example. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1879.2s)]
*  Scholars have been trying desperately to open the scrolls since they were discovered. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1880.2s)]
*  The mystery of the unwrapping of the Herculaneum scrolls is littered with failures. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1885.24s)]
*  Everyone who had tried to open the scrolls had left behind [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1892.24s)]
*  a hideous trail of fragmentary result. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1895.24s)]
*  Brent Seals, a brash computer scientist from the New World, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1898.24s)]
*  the University of Kentucky to be precise, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1903.24s)]
*  had what he thought was a brilliant idea to solve the 2,000-year-old mystery, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1905.24s)]
*  use modern medical imaging technology. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1911.24s)]
*  People were going to the doctor every day and they were doing a CT scan or an MRI [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1914.28s)]
*  and they were seeing inside their body completely non-invasively. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1918.28s)]
*  If you can do that to a human in the doctor's office, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1922.28s)]
*  why couldn't we see inside a scroll? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1924.28s)]
*  That was the thinking. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1926.28s)]
*  Didn't think it was that far-fetched? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1927.28s)]
*  No. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1929.28s)]
*  In the arcane world where academics spend their entire careers [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1930.28s)]
*  pouring over fragments of ancient texts, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1934.28s)]
*  Brent Seals is a superstar. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1937.28s)]
*  He made his name digitally restoring damaged medieval manuscripts [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1940.32s)]
*  with software he had designed. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1945.32s)]
*  A colleague told him about the scrolls of Herculaneum, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1947.32s)]
*  most housed at the Library of Naples, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1950.32s)]
*  a few others in France and England. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1953.32s)]
*  He considered them the ultimate challenge. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1956.32s)]
*  The people are gone, the cultures are gone, the places are gone, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1960.32s)]
*  and yet, like a time capsule, you have this item that tells a story. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1963.32s)]
*  All locked away in that thing that looks like a little lump of charcoal. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1968.36s)]
*  They're all locked away. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1972.36s)]
*  He knew imaging technology could only reveal a jumble of letters like this. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1973.36s)]
*  To actually read the scrolls, he'd have to unroll them, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1979.36s)]
*  much like this medieval French scroll at the Morgan Library in Manhattan. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1984.36s)]
*  But he'd have to do this virtually. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1989.36s)]
*  After years of trial and error, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1993.36s)]
*  he and his students thought they'd cracked the code [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1995.3999999999999s)]
*  with algorithms and software. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=1998.3999999999999s)]
*  He was cocky enough to announce at Oxford [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2000.3999999999999s)]
*  to an international conference of scholars who study ancient papyrus [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2003.3999999999999s)]
*  that he could do what no one else had done. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2007.3999999999999s)]
*  I swung for the fence. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2010.3999999999999s)]
*  I gave him a talk where I said, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2012.3999999999999s)]
*  I think we can read everything inside the Herculaneum scrolls [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2015.3999999999999s)]
*  without opening them. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2018.3999999999999s)]
*  Did you think the peperologists would come running to you [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2019.3999999999999s)]
*  with their scrolls and say, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2022.3999999999999s)]
*  Here, take a look at these. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2024.44s)]
*  I smile now because that is exactly what I thought. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2026.44s)]
*  Didn't happen? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2029.44s)]
*  No. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2030.44s)]
*  So how hard is it to get your hands on these scrolls? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2031.44s)]
*  I would say somewhere in the vicinity of nigh near impossible. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2035.44s)]
*  That's because they're so rare and so fragile, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2040.44s)]
*  curators are reluctant to let anyone handle them, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2043.44s)]
*  including a superstar like Brent Seals. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2046.44s)]
*  They wouldn't relent even after he published a paper [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2049.44s)]
*  showing a better way to peer inside the scrolls [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2053.48s)]
*  with this, a synchrotron, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2056.48s)]
*  a super powerful X-ray generated by electrons [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2059.48s)]
*  racing around this ring at almost the speed of light. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2063.48s)]
*  There are only about 50 in the world. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2066.48s)]
*  This one is in Britain. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2069.48s)]
*  The X-ray is this green beam, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2072.48s)]
*  100 billion times stronger than any hospital X-ray. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2075.48s)]
*  Maybe it's coincidence, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2080.52s)]
*  but shortly after Seals published his pioneering paper, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2082.52s)]
*  Just to give you an idea. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2086.52s)]
*  two Italian scholars stepped forward [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2088.52s)]
*  and claimed they had had the same idea to use a synchrotron. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2090.52s)]
*  Vito Macchella, a physicist from Naples, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2094.52s)]
*  says he first learned about the scrolls as a child. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2097.52s)]
*  I cannot remember exactly the age, but nine, ten. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2101.52s)]
*  And Graziano Rinocchia, a papyrologist. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2105.52s)]
*  He studies ancient Roman papyrus. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2108.56s)]
*  He pours over bits of herculaneum scrolls [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2111.56s)]
*  at the Naples library. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2114.56s)]
*  Most are fragments of Greek philosophy. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2116.56s)]
*  I'm coming here and working on this papyri every day. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2119.56s)]
*  Call it academic competition, call it ego, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2122.56s)]
*  but American Brent Seals, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2126.56s)]
*  Rinocchia, the papyrologist, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2128.56s)]
*  and Italian physicist Macchella [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2130.56s)]
*  became fierce competitors, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2132.56s)]
*  all fighting to make history [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2135.56s)]
*  and first to reveal the contents of the scrolls, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2137.6s)]
*  a gladiatorial wrestling match [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2140.6s)]
*  in the hallowed halls of the ivory tower. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2142.6s)]
*  Rinocchia accuses Macchella of sabotaging his research. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2145.6s)]
*  Seals is convinced the Italians poached his idea [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2150.6s)]
*  to use the synchrotron. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2153.6s)]
*  The mystery of the scrolls is playing out [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2155.6s)]
*  like some tragic Italian opera. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2158.6s)]
*  You know, they say, Bill, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2160.6s)]
*  that the reason academics argue [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2162.6s)]
*  is because the stakes are so low, right? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2164.6s)]
*  The stakes actually are really high. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2166.64s)]
*  If you think about the possibility [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2168.64s)]
*  of revealing these manuscripts to the world [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2170.64s)]
*  from 2,000 years ago, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2173.64s)]
*  that no one's ever read. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2175.64s)]
*  And, okay, so now we're going to argue with each other? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2177.64s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2181.64s)]
*  I mean, maybe we could do that later [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2182.64s)]
*  after we've read them. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2184.64s)]
*  But the two Italian rivals [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2185.64s)]
*  use their European connections [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2187.64s)]
*  and convince curators to let each of them [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2189.64s)]
*  and only them have limited access [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2192.64s)]
*  to a few scrolls to scan with the synchrotron. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2195.68s)]
*  They leapfrogged over American Brent Seals [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2198.68s)]
*  and raced to this one in Grenoble, France. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2201.68s)]
*  Macchella got there first. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2204.68s)]
*  It was hard for us to make out, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2207.68s)]
*  but he said his scan revealed letters. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2210.68s)]
*  These are letters? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2213.68s)]
*  Sì. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2214.68s)]
*  Questi sono lettere? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2215.68s)]
*  Yes, he said. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2217.68s)]
*  These are letters. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2218.68s)]
*  Macchella won international praise and headlines [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2220.68s)]
*  as the first person to see inside [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2223.72s)]
*  one of the ancient scrolls of Herculaneum. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2226.72s)]
*  When papirologist Ranocchia scanned his scrolls, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2229.72s)]
*  he said he did Macchella one better. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2232.72s)]
*  Has anyone else found anything as clear as this? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2235.72s)]
*  Nothing like this. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2240.72s)]
*  He said he saw phrases. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2242.72s)]
*  Pace, theia, namely they would be persuaded. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2244.72s)]
*  This is a... [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2247.72s)]
*  Would be persuaded. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2248.72s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2249.72s)]
*  Brent Seals is not persuaded. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2250.72s)]
*  You don't believe that? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2252.7599999999998s)]
*  Hey, I engage in wishful thinking all the time, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2253.7599999999998s)]
*  but at the end of the day, I'm a scientist, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2257.7599999999998s)]
*  and wishful thinking is not what science is based on. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2260.7599999999998s)]
*  I was unable to replicate their results, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2264.7599999999998s)]
*  and so far I've not heard from anyone [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2267.7599999999998s)]
*  who's been able to replicate them. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2270.7599999999998s)]
*  But with their findings published in scientific journals, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2272.7599999999998s)]
*  the Italian scholars savored their achievements. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2275.7599999999998s)]
*  Macchella considers Brent Seals' criticism [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2278.7599999999998s)]
*  sour grapes. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2281.8s)]
*  Brent Seals looked at your latest findings [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2282.8s)]
*  and he says he doesn't see any letters. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2286.8s)]
*  I know. I don't know why. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2289.8s)]
*  You don't know why? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2291.8s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2292.8s)]
*  I guess my threshold is somewhat different. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2293.8s)]
*  When I see writing, you know, it should line up. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2295.8s)]
*  It should be more than a letter or two. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2298.8s)]
*  You ought to be able to see text [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2299.8s)]
*  that looks like something you can actually read. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2301.8s)]
*  Since he couldn't get access to the Herculaneum scrolls, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2303.8s)]
*  Seals looked elsewhere to prove his findings. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2307.8s)]
*  He looked elsewhere to prove his algorithms and software. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2310.84s)]
*  That led him to Jerusalem and this charred fragment, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2313.84s)]
*  a 1700-year-old scroll from a burned synagogue near the Dead Sea. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2318.84s)]
*  Is there a line up here? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2324.84s)]
*  Israeli archaeologists didn't expect much, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2325.84s)]
*  but what Seals' software revealed was like a miracle. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2328.84s)]
*  What was it? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2332.84s)]
*  What was the Bible? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2333.84s)]
*  He resurrected all the surviving Hebrew script, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2335.84s)]
*  the oldest text of the Bible as we know it today. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2338.88s)]
*  The first two chapters of Leviticus in a scroll that prior to that [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2342.88s)]
*  was assumed to be nothing or so badly damaged, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2346.88s)]
*  no one would ever know. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2349.88s)]
*  This is what you would hope to see in the Herculaneum scrolls? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2351.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2355.88s)]
*  I mean, this is actually an identifiable text. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2356.88s)]
*  Following his breakthrough in Jerusalem, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2359.88s)]
*  even Graziano Renocchia admits Brent Seals' software is brilliant. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2362.88s)]
*  Now, the Naples Library, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2367.92s)]
*  which wouldn't let Seals get his hands on the scrolls, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2369.92s)]
*  is considering granting him access. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2372.92s)]
*  He is convinced the secrets of Herculaneum [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2375.92s)]
*  locked away in the scrolls for 2,000 years are just within reach. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2378.92s)]
*  Almost exactly four years ago, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2384.96s)]
*  the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris caught fire. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2387.96s)]
*  It was one of those 21st century moments [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2390.96s)]
*  that people around the world experienced together, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2393.96s)]
*  staring in horror at live video on their smartphones and televisions. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2396.96s)]
*  For the people of France, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2401.96s)]
*  the cathedral was the most important place [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2403.96s)]
*  to be in the world. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2406.96s)]
*  The cathedral was the most important place [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2408.96s)]
*  because Notre-Dame [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2412.0s)]
*  has been a powerful symbol [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2414.0s)]
*  both sacred and secular since medieval times. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2416.0s)]
*  French president Emmanuel Macron [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2419.0s)]
*  pledged that Notre-Dame [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2422.0s)]
*  would be reopen by the end of 2024. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2424.0s)]
*  He couldn't have known then [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2426.0s)]
*  how hard it would be to keep that promise. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2428.0s)]
*  But on this Easter Sunday, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2431.0s)]
*  four years later, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2433.0s)]
*  the resurrection of the great cathedral [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2435.0s)]
*  seems within reach. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2437.0s)]
*  Anyway, the last time the cathedral was re-opened [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2439.0s)]
*  within reach. Flames tore through the roof of Notre Dame on the evening of April 15th, 2019, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2441.0s)]
*  and spread with incredible speed and ferocity engulfing her 200-foot spire. Jean-Louis Jurgelin [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2451.56s)]
*  is the man now in charge of restoring Notre Dame. And a lot of people in France cry because they [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2463.76s)]
*  feel that something very deep in the soul of France, in the spirit of France, was about to collapse. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2472.28s)]
*  Only a heroic effort by the Paris Fire Brigade saved Notre Dame from collapse as a few staffers [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2479.48s)]
*  race through falling embers to rescue precious relics. Philippe Villeneuve, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2490.0s)]
*  the cathedral's chief architect, was out of town that night and raced back to Paris. He was devastated [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2496.0s)]
*  by what he saw. I've said that the little boy who was in love with the cathedral and the architect [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2502.72s)]
*  who was in charge of it died that day. And another man took over and said, I have to save the cathedral. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2510.28s)]
*  It's my mission. It's my duty. Villeneuve now shares that duty. If he's the artist who knows [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2518.36s)]
*  every inch of stone in Notre Dame, retired army general Jurgelin is the commander called back to [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2525.28s)]
*  meet that five-year deadline. I will relax only when this will be done. What does this cathedral [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2532.32s)]
*  mean to the people of France? The cathedral, Notre Dame de Paris, is in some way the heart of France [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2540.28s)]
*  for the Catholic of course, for the Christian, but for everybody. All the great events of France [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2547.6000000000004s)]
*  in some way or another took place here in the cathedral. Napoleon crowned himself emperor in [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2555.0400000000004s)]
*  Notre Dame in 1804. In 1944, as Paris was liberated from Nazi occupation, General Charles de Gaulle [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2560.8s)]
*  braved sniper fire to enter the cathedral. In many ways you could say that she's the people's [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2569.44s)]
*  palace. Agnès Prarier is a journalist and author who lives and works just across the River Seine [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2577.96s)]
*  from Notre Dame. She and her neighbors watched the most horrifying moment the night of the fire, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2584.56s)]
*  the collapse of that imposing spire. I remember the scream of the crowd saying no, as if they [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2590.0s)]
*  couldn't they couldn't conceive such a thing. That spire meant so much to Philippe Villeneuve [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2601.48s)]
*  that he had it tattooed on his arm. They say that I have Notre Dame in my skin, he told us. It's [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2608.92s)]
*  very practical because when I have to explain how the spire fell, it's always better to show [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2618.24s)]
*  that from here to there it tipped over. The huge spire made of oak and covered in lead tiles [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2624.68s)]
*  crashed through two of the stone vaults which form the ceiling of Notre Dame, leaving gaping [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2632.08s)]
*  holes at the top and heaps of broken stone and charred wood on the floor below. The top priority [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2638.9599999999996s)]
*  was to shore up the Grand Cathedral's weakened structure. Huge temporary wooden supports were [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2648.08s)]
*  placed under the surviving stone vaults of her ceiling and under the flying buttresses to save [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2655.44s)]
*  this prime example of medieval engineering. We have to check every stone in the cathedral, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2661.36s)]
*  every pillar. At the same time a huge decontamination project was mounted to remove lead [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2667.72s)]
*  tiles that had melted from the burning roof and spire and all the toxic lead dust spread by the [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2674.36s)]
*  fire. Four years on workers still take extraordinary precautions against lead poisoning. We had to wear [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2680.52s)]
*  disposable hazmat suits to enter the cathedral. Tons of rubble had to be removed, paintings and [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2688.48s)]
*  stained glass windows were taken away for restoration and twisted steel scaffolding erected for ongoing [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2695.56s)]
*  restoration work had to be dismantled. So you were in the process of restoring the spire when the fire [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2702.76s)]
*  broke out in 2019. Did your restoration project have anything to do with the fire breaking out? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2709.92s)]
*  An investigation is still underway, Philippe Villeneuve told us, and no cause of the fire [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2718.2000000000003s)]
*  has been identified, but personally it's unbearable. This fire never should have happened and it did. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2726.64s)]
*  Inevitably I feel responsible. At that point in our interview Villeneuve switched to English [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2733.7599999999998s)]
*  with a rueful smile. In reality I'm totally destroyed. Really? Yes. I so want to rebuild [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2741.7999999999997s)]
*  Notre Dame is because I want to rebuild myself. The fire's deeply emotional impact on Philippe [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2754.72s)]
*  Villeneuve was mirrored around the world. Nearly a billion dollars in private donations have been [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2762.52s)]
*  pledged to rebuild Notre Dame, most of it from France, 50 million dollars from Americans. I [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2771.2s)]
*  know many people in the United States contributed. They can contribute again. They can continue to [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2777.96s)]
*  contribute. The cash is always running. If I want to give me money I need. In the weeks immediately [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2784.32s)]
*  following the fire all sorts of ideas were floated for how centuries-old Notre Dame might be given a [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2790.56s)]
*  touch of avant-garde. And all those architects throughout the world said yes let's have a roof [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2797.52s)]
*  garden, let's have a golden torch, let's have a titanium spire. You know even I for 20 seconds I [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2803.52s)]
*  thought hmm to add some 21st century genius to Notre Dame why not? Chief architect Philippe Villeneuve [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2811.28s)]
*  had a very simple answer why not. An historic monument, a cathedral, is not something to be [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2819.32s)]
*  played with he told us. Notre Dame had been standing for 850 years with a wooden frame and [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2828.8s)]
*  a lead roof so wood is the way to go. In the end President Macron and a special committee agreed [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2835.56s)]
*  to rebuild Notre Dame exactly as she had been and with the same materials, stone, wood and lead. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2843.88s)]
*  How is it that the traditionalists won out? Well I think wisdom won. Notre Dame's signature spire [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2852.64s)]
*  was a fairly recent addition. Images of the cathedral from the mid-1800s show her without a spire and in [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2862.52s)]
*  an advanced state of decay. The cathedral was in great disrepair was it not? It was about to collapse [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2870.0s)]
*  but of neglect not of fire. There were even proposals to demolish Notre Dame before the cathedral [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2877.96s)]
*  crumbled on its own. Instead the French government hired a young architect named Violette Le Duc. He [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2884.8s)]
*  created that famous spire. So you are rebuilding the spire exactly as Violette Le Duc? Yes. Are [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2891.92s)]
*  you using his original drawings? We were lucky he said because it was extremely well documented. We [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2899.6800000000003s)]
*  have the drawings of Violette Le Duc, the sketches, the surveys. We have everything needed to be able [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2908.36s)]
*  to remake it. A thousand French oak trees were felled for the new spire then fine cut by carpenters [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2914.52s)]
*  in eastern France. In other workshops around the country the cathedral's organ, the largest in France [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2924.72s)]
*  and many of its stained glass windows were restored. How many workers and craftsmen do you have on this [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2931.08s)]
*  project? If we take into account all the people in France it's about 1,000 people. On the plaza [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2937.76s)]
*  in front of Notre Dame a huge tent has been erected where stone cutters and sculptors are recreating [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2947.0800000000004s)]
*  gothic gargoyles and adornments damaged in the fire. Philippe Villeneuve supervises every detail. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2954.92s)]
*  I'll make them put their fingers on the layers of the original sculpture he said and then on [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2962.08s)]
*  the layer they're sculpting. So he wants you to feel it not just look at it. Yeah. And that works? Yeah I think so. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2972.08s)]
*  Dane LeBlanc is just 23 years old sculpting and chiseling to recreate a floral detail carved [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2981.64s)]
*  hundreds of years ago. We try to remake things identically she said but we are also trying to [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2990.52s)]
*  understand the intention of the original sculptors so we look at the traces left by their tools. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=2998.52s)]
*  We were given rare access to the painstaking restoration of Notre Dame as workers and artisans [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3004.84s)]
*  revived the cathedral's exterior and her interior. Oh my god. The cathedral's great rose windows [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3014.08s)]
*  have been meticulously cleaned. Look at this. And every inch of stone coated with latex which when [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3024.2799999999997s)]
*  peeled away leaves the surface gleaming. We found restorers Mathilde Maire and Aude Massimi working [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3033.6s)]
*  on painted stone sculptures depicting scenes from the life of Christ. How old is this? This part of [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3043.04s)]
*  the cathedral she said was built at the beginning of the 14th century. These sculptures are medieval. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3054.4s)]
*  The restorers are carefully wiping every surface with small cotton swabs dipped in a water-based [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3060.7599999999998s)]
*  cleaning solution. So I think you have to have a lot of patience. Yes. Yes she says you have to be [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3068.56s)]
*  calm and know that it will take time but it's a pleasure. You can see she's wiping away the [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3077.7200000000003s)]
*  sentries. A 600 ton maze of scaffolding has been built inside Notre Dame to support all the work [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3084.56s)]
*  especially the rebuilding of the spire. General Georges Land took us up through it two-thirds of [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3092.8799999999997s)]
*  the way on a construction elevator. We reached the top climbing steps and ladders. This is [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3099.64s)]
*  incredible. We were standing 100 feet above the cathedral floor in exactly the spot where the [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3107.92s)]
*  flaming spire collapsed. Four years ago there was nothing here but a vast hole. The drama took place [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3114.7599999999998s)]
*  here and we have to rebuild the vault of the transept. The spire will be there. 66 meters high. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3122.3199999999997s)]
*  At the top of the old 200 foot spire sat a copper sculpture of a rooster the symbol of the French [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3130.7599999999998s)]
*  people. The day after the fire Philippe Villeneuve found it on a lower roof a bit mangled but [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3138.08s)]
*  miraculously untouched by the flames. It has been left as it was found and will be put on display in [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3144.74s)]
*  the restored cathedral. Can I tell you Villeneuve says that I plan to put a new rooster on top of a [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3151.76s)]
*  new spire one year to the day before the reopening of the cathedral. There will still be scaffolding [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3159.7200000000003s)]
*  but the frame of the spire will again be in the sky of Paris. And the spire will rest on these [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3166.44s)]
*  four pillars you see here. You see? Be magnificent. Magnificent yes for the glory of God and France. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNztNewDwew&t=3177.96s)]
