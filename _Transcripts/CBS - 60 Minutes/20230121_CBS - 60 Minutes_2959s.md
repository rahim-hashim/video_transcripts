# Hubble Space Telescope, Planet 9, Curiosity Mars Rover, Cosmic Roulette | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [January 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4)
*  When we look up at the stars, it's humbling to realize we are only getting a peek at what's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=0.0s)]
*  up there. That way beyond what's visible to the naked eye lie wondrous galaxies we [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=18.84s)]
*  never knew existed until the Hubble Space Telescope. For 27 years since it was launched [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=24.74s)]
*  into space, Hubble has been sending us stunning images of the vast heavens. Over the years, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=31.02s)]
*  astronauts have repeatedly upgraded Hubble, so its most dramatic discoveries have come [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=37.78s)]
*  recently. Tonight, we'll take you up to Hubble and billions of light years beyond to see [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=43.58s)]
*  some of its latest, most spectacular revelations. NASA celebrates Hubble's birthday each year [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=50.04s)]
*  by giving us a gift, a new breathtaking view of our universe. The latest birthday card? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=57.64s)]
*  This elegant swirl of galaxies dancing in tandem deep in space. Last year, this bubble [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=65.6s)]
*  of stellar gases floating among the stars like a diaphanous cosmic jellyfish. Hubble has shown [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=73.0s)]
*  us radiant, rose-shaped galaxies stretching across deep space and dramatic towering clouds [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=80.52s)]
*  of gas teeming with the stuff of creation. Stars are born here. Year after year in the infinite [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=87.4s)]
*  black canvas overhead, Hubble paints an ever-expanding picture of our universe, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=95.2s)]
*  an awe-inspiring light show for us to admire and for scientists to study. I believe Hubble has [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=100.56s)]
*  been the single most transformative scientific instrument that we've ever built. Most transformative, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=107.52s)]
*  says NASA astrophysicist Amber Strawn, because Hubble keeps improving our understanding of the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  universe. She showed us what Hubble discovered after staring for days into what seemed to be [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  an empty black patch, a deep dark void in outer space. The original Hubble deep field is located [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=127.72s)]
*  just above the Big Dipper. It's a part of the sky that most people are familiar with. It's a blank [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=135.44s)]
*  piece of sky. So just nothing in here, just darkness? Nothing at all, complete darkness. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=141.08s)]
*  And then when we look at it with Hubble, what we see is thousands of galaxies. Not just stars, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=145.72s)]
*  galaxies. Galaxies outside of our own, something we never imagined. Is it that Hubble just stares [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=152.4s)]
*  into that dark spot until the light penetrates and reveals itself? That's exactly what happens. It's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=158.48s)]
*  sometimes many, many, many days of just staring at one part of the sky and allowing the photons [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=164.68s)]
*  to collect on your detector. And this is what's revealed. And this is what's revealed. But Hubble [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=170.68s)]
*  was just warming up. That was 22 years ago. Since then, Hubble has stared deeper and longer [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=176.24s)]
*  into space with enhanced equipment. In this particular image, there are 10,000 galaxies. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  So every single point of light is an individual galaxy, its own little island universe. And so [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=189.28s)]
*  this is a real visualization of the distances of these galaxies. So sort of like 3D, like we're [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  flying through. So we can make these images 3D because we know how far away the galaxies are. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=200.84s)]
*  What Hubble has essentially given us is the size of the universe. Hubble has taught us that the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  universe is filled with hundreds of billions of other galaxies. And now the latest analysis of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=210.64s)]
*  Hubble's data reveals there could be more than 2 trillion galaxies, 10 times more than previously [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=217.04s)]
*  thought. Typical galaxies like our Milky Way have 100 billion stars. That means the total number of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=224.56s)]
*  stars or suns out there is two followed by 23 zeros. That's called 200 sextillion. To get some [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=233.04s)]
*  sense of how many stars that is, we went to Adam Reese, who won a Nobel Prize for his work on Hubble. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=243.12s)]
*  This is more stars in the visible universe than grains of sand on the beach. On Earth. On all the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  beaches on Earth. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=256.0s)]
*  And Hubble has shown us this? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=257.12s)]
*  It has. In many cases, it has allowed us to see what some of the most distant galaxies look like [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=259.28s)]
*  and how many stars were in them. And we've been able to add it all up. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=266.0s)]
*  Hubble has been called a time machine, that it looks back in time. What has been the most astounding [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=269.68s)]
*  part of that for you? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=278.56s)]
*  I study explosions of stars called supernovae. It's like fireworks. It's only visible for a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=280.16s)]
*  short period of time, in this case a few weeks. And that light has been traveling to us for 10 [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=286.0s)]
*  billion years. It began its journey when the Earth wasn't even here. And over those 10 billion years, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=291.52s)]
*  our planet formed, life developed. We built a Hubble Space Telescope. We opened the aperture door. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=298.24s)]
*  And in the last one billionth of one percent of that journey that the light made, we opened the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  door just in time to catch it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=311.44s)]
*  Hubble almost didn't catch anything. The first pictures it sent back were blurry because of a [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=313.52s)]
*  microscopic flaw in the mirror. The space agency launched a daring mission to fix it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=319.68s)]
*  And astronauts have made five trips to Hubble to repair and upgrade its equipment. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=326.0s)]
*  John Grunsfeld, known as the Hubble repairman, flew three of those missions to a telescope the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=337.36s)]
*  size of a school bus orbiting 300 miles above Earth. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=343.6s)]
*  Just about anything that we can easily change and upgrade and fix has been fixed. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=348.24s)]
*  The workings of the telescope, all of that has been transformed. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=353.76s)]
*  Yep. It is like a new telescope. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=357.28s)]
*  On your last mission, you come out of the airlock and you've got this big smile on your face. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  I thought, you know, I can't imagine anywhere I'd rather be than outside the space shuttle in my [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=366.88s)]
*  spacesuit next to the Hubble Space Telescope. I was just so happy. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=373.28s)]
*  Hubble has changed what we know about the universe, its structure, evolution, its age, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=377.28s)]
*  13.8 billion years. Hubble showed us the marvel and majesty of stars being born. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=383.36s)]
*  This is a region of gas and dust that's turning up new baby stars. And now we've learned with [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=390.8s)]
*  Hubble not only stars, but also baby planet systems. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=396.24s)]
*  Most of these stars have planets going around them? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=400.32s)]
*  Most stars actually do have planets. When I was a kid, we only knew the planets inside our solar [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=404.32s)]
*  system. And now we know that the planets are absolutely everywhere. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=410.0s)]
*  Astronomer Heidi Hamill specializes in Hubble's work within our solar system. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=414.24s)]
*  With the telescope, she saw huge fragments of a comet slam into Jupiter, creating giant impacts. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=420.24s)]
*  When I first heard that a comet was going to hit Jupiter, my reaction was, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=428.8s)]
*  eh, so what. Jupiter's huge, comets are small. And so when I saw the first impact site, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=433.12s)]
*  and it was huge and dark, I was flabbergasted. This is where the comet has smacked into the planet [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=442.64s)]
*  at such a high velocity that it's caused an explosion, the equivalent of many, many [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=451.44s)]
*  millions of atomic bombs. The earth is the size of that ring. And so if this event had happened on [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=458.08s)]
*  earth, we're gone. Yeah, we call that a biosphere changing event, which basically means we'd be gone. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  Hubble orbits high outside earth's atmosphere so it can see a wide spectrum of light our atmosphere [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  blocks. Beyond earth's protective layer, Hubble's ultraviolet camera can spot dazzling displays [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=480.56s)]
*  like this glowing halo on top of Jupiter. Up in the northern hemisphere, what you're seeing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=488.32s)]
*  is the glowing aurorae. An aurora happens when the planet's magnetic field has charged particles [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=494.24s)]
*  that interact with the upper atmosphere. What you're seeing there is actually charged particles from [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  the sun. They get swept up in Jupiter's strong magnetic field, and then it's mirrored in that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=506.96s)]
*  shimmering that you see inside the auroral oval. And you would not be able to see that with an earth [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=513.04s)]
*  telescope? You could never see those aurorae because our atmosphere has an ozone layer that [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=518.64s)]
*  absorbs the ultraviolet light. Hubble also found a similar blue hue at the bottom of Saturn. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=525.52s)]
*  The telescope's most iconic picture is this, the Pillars of Creation, a stellar breeding place. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=532.64s)]
*  Amber Strawn showed us what a difference Hubble's upgraded infrared camera made just two years ago. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=539.68s)]
*  Stars are born inside these dust clouds, and this is going to give you a clue on why infrared is so [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=546.72s)]
*  important. It's because in infrared light, what you see is the stars inside shining through. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=551.76s)]
*  How big is this cloud area? Top to bottom, these pillars are about 10 light years, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=559.2s)]
*  which is about 60 trillion miles. 60 trillion miles. Space is big. Big and miraculous, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=564.72s)]
*  with constant celestial regeneration. Strawn calls this the everything picture because you can see [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=573.76s)]
*  old stars blowing up and new stars forming. Anytime you see these sort of dark, cloudy regions, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=581.68s)]
*  you can imagine that there's stars being born inside there. Where are the dying stars? And the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=589.04s)]
*  dying stars, we think that this one could explode any day, literally, or it could be a thousand years [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=593.76s)]
*  from now, but near near term in astronomers' time. In cosmic times any day. Right. So big stars, when they die, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  they explode and send their contents into the surrounding universe. And these contents are what [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=605.84s)]
*  seed future stars and future planets and help to seed life. Ultimately, the iron in your blood [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=612.72s)]
*  and the calcium in your bones was literally forged inside of a star that ended its life like this. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=619.52s)]
*  So we are all star dust. We literally are star dust. We are viscerally made of the stars. One [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=625.44s)]
*  of the things I think is remarkable about this image is it shows you how colorful the universe is. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=631.36s)]
*  This looks like contemporary art. This is a very tightly bound group of stars, and what you see here [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=636.08s)]
*  is about a hundred thousand stars. This was one of the first images that Hubble's new camera [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=642.96s)]
*  installed in 2009. This was one of the first images it took. Blue stars are the youngest and hottest. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=649.12s)]
*  White and yellow stars, like our sun, are midlife, while red stars are the oldest and coolest. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=655.84s)]
*  John Grunsfeld has a cool claim to fame. He's the last human to touch Hubble. He gave it a farewell [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=664.4s)]
*  pact. Hubble was planned to live for 15 years. It's now been 27. How much longer can Hubble go? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=672.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm reasonably confident it will continue another three to five years. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=680.96s)]
*  That means for a while at least, Hubble will work in tandem with its successor, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=685.12s)]
*  the much larger James Webb telescope scheduled to launch in 2019. Webb should be able to detect [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=690.0s)]
*  light from the very earliest galaxies. The farthest back Hubble can see is this red blob, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  a galaxy from 400 million years after the Big Bang. Webb should take us much closer [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=704.56s)]
*  to the beginning of time. So the James Webb Space Telescope was specifically designed to see the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=711.5999999999999s)]
*  first stars and galaxies that were formed in the universe. So we're going to see the snapshot [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  of when stars started, when galaxies started, the very first moments of the universe. And [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=723.1199999999999s)]
*  my bet, there's going to be some big surprises. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=728.56s)]
*  How many planets are there? Nine is what we were taught. But as telescopes get stronger and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=743.1199999999999s)]
*  astronomers learn more about our solar system, long accepted facts become fallacies. Pluto had [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=749.3599999999999s)]
*  been considered a planet for 76 years, but Pluto lost its planet status after an astronomer at Cal [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=756.56s)]
*  Tech discovered that Pluto wasn't so special after all. His name is Mike Brown. Brown and other [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=764.4799999999999s)]
*  astronomers have since found hundreds of large balls of ice like Pluto circling the sun at the [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=772.3199999999999s)]
*  far reaches of our solar system. Demoting Pluto leaves us with eight planets. But Mike Brown is [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=778.9599999999999s)]
*  preparing another surprise. He is sure there is a real ninth planet way out far beyond Pluto. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=785.92s)]
*  He hasn't seen it yet, but he expects too soon. He believes the real planet nine is huge and it's out [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=793.76s)]
*  there. I would say at this point, I'm certain. Certain. Yeah, that's a rare thing to say for a [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=802.0s)]
*  prediction for a scientist. And I'm willing to say it. You do know how mind boggling this [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=810.64s)]
*  sounds. I mean, a new planet hasn't been discovered for 170 years. I believe you think it looks like [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=817.12s)]
*  this animation over my shoulder here. You know, we took a little artistic license and put some [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=824.48s)]
*  lightning on the dark side of it because it might have lightning on the dark side of it. We think [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=828.72s)]
*  that it's somewhere between 10 and 20 times more massive than the earth. And we haven't seen it. We [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=833.68s)]
*  can't see it. It's so far away that it's actually just at the edge of what our biggest telescopes [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=841.04s)]
*  on the ground can possibly see because it's so far away. 50 billion miles away. It's also hard to find [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=848.3199999999999s)]
*  because it has an enormous orbit. Planet nine, we think, takes something like 15,000 years to go [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=856.16s)]
*  around the sun. 15,000 years to make one orbit. One orbit. To search for planet nine, Brown goes up [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=862.32s)]
*  Mauna Kea, the big mountain on Hawaii's Big Island, to use the big telescope, the Subaru. Brown doesn't [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=869.9200000000001s)]
*  look directly through the telescope. He monitors pictures it's taking of the same sections of sky [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=878.72s)]
*  on successive nights and then compares them hunting for movement. We have to very systematically look [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=884.5600000000001s)]
*  at every patch of sky here, here, here, here. And what we're looking for is actually kind of simple. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=891.52s)]
*  We take a picture one night. We come back the next night. All the stars, all the galaxies are in the [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=898.96s)]
*  same spot night after night after night. And planet nine, when we see it, will slowly move across the sky. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=905.4399999999999s)]
*  And will look something like this. Brown's discovery 11 years ago that changed the way we [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=912.4s)]
*  think of the solar system. Using pictures from successive nights, Brown discovered this Pluto-sized [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=918.72s)]
*  object, which led to the demotion of lovable Pluto. You didn't love Pluto growing up? I loved Pluto. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=925.44s)]
*  I was totally fascinated by Pluto. When I started in astronomy, I started looking at this region of [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=932.24s)]
*  the sky because I thought it was so interesting out there. When Pluto was first discovered, it was thought [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=937.2s)]
*  to be a big planet. You can go back and find the New York Times headline on the day that the discovery [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=943.0400000000001s)]
*  was announced. And it says, a ninth planet discovered in the outer solar system, possibly [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=948.4s)]
*  larger than Jupiter. Jupiter's the biggest planet, but Pluto, it turned out, was no Jupiter. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=954.64s)]
*  These are all the planets and other objects at their real relative sizes. This is Jupiter. Jupiter [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=961.76s)]
*  is huge compared to the other things. This is Jupiter. This is Saturn without its rings, Uranus, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=969.6s)]
*  Neptune, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars. And at the very edge of the solar system, as we now think of it, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=976.32s)]
*  is Pluto. It's only wrong by a factor of 50,000. So it went from being a monster planet to being a [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=983.2800000000001s)]
*  dwarf planet. A dwarf planet, one of many that are out there that are part of this region of the sky. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=990.72s)]
*  This region is the Kuiper Belt at the edge of our solar system, a vast realm of frozen debris created [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=996.5600000000001s)]
*  during the birth of the solar system four and a half billion years ago. The Kuiper Belt keeps [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1003.84s)]
*  Brown up all night hunting for discoveries. It's the most exciting thing I can think of doing. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1009.52s)]
*  You know, it's not just that it's hard to stay up all night and so I force myself to do it. I am excited [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1015.12s)]
*  every night I go out there about what I might find. When Mike Brown found that Pluto-sized object, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1021.12s)]
*  it was the biggest of a group of hundreds of Pluto-like objects recently discovered. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1026.88s)]
*  So Brown wondered, should Pluto really be a planet? But demoting Pluto would mean that every [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1032.32s)]
*  textbook showing planets would have to be changed. That was fine with Brown, who believes planets [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1038.96s)]
*  must be significant and that the eight large planets are. Their strong gravitational fields [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1045.36s)]
*  control everything around them. Planets are the big bullies of the planetary system that are, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1051.6s)]
*  that basically ignore everybody else around them and everybody else has to deal with the planets. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1058.08s)]
*  Those are what the planets are. And Pluto didn't fit that concept. Neptune controls Pluto's orbit. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  Neptune is the bully of that neighborhood. To resolve the issue, astronomers from all over [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1069.04s)]
*  the world gathered in Prague in 2006, the International Astronomical Union would decide [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1075.04s)]
*  whether to demote little Pluto or give planet status to hundreds of similar objects. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1081.52s)]
*  XA is concerned with Pluto and Pluto-like objects. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1088.08s)]
*  Astronomers voted overwhelmingly to go down to eight planets and Brown became known as the guy [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1094.1599999999999s)]
*  who killed Pluto. I think that's probably true. The Pluto vote was ill time for NASA. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1100.72s)]
*  Just seven months before Pluto's demotion, NASA launched a mission to Pluto to learn about its [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1109.1999999999998s)]
*  surface and origins. Scientists are still analyzing spectacular pictures from NASA's flyby. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1115.52s)]
*  They show Pluto's mostly icy surface and close-ups of craters. Now the spaceship is heading deeper [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1122.8799999999999s)]
*  into the Kuiper belt. Although Pluto was demoted 10 years ago, Pluto lovers still send Brown hate [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1130.08s)]
*  mail and voicemail. He kept this one. Even Brown's 11-year-old daughter, Lila, didn't like what he had [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1137.52s)]
*  done to Pluto. What did you tell him that he should do to make up for that? Well, I told him that if he [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1149.76s)]
*  found a new planet, it might make up for the fact that he killed a planet that everybody loved. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1155.84s)]
*  Seems that he actually went out and did that. Yeah. What do you think of that? It's really great. I'm [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1161.6799999999998s)]
*  very proud of him. She's referring to the huge planet nine we mentioned earlier. No one was more [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1168.3999999999999s)]
*  surprised by that discovery than Brown himself. Until recently, he believed our planets would [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1175.6799999999998s)]
*  only be the big eight. And we had explored so much of the solar system beyond those eight [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1181.76s)]
*  that if there were anything else like a planet, we would have found it. After all, NASA's spaceships [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1188.08s)]
*  have flown past every known planet, capturing pictures of Saturn's rings, the pockmarked surface [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1193.6s)]
*  of Mercury, the gassy atmosphere of Jupiter, and well beyond our solar system, the Hubble telescope [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1200.32s)]
*  is busy taking pictures of distant galaxies. NASA says this single image shows 10,000 galaxies. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1207.52s)]
*  Other pictures show signs of black holes millions of light years away. And this one, a glimpse of [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1216.16s)]
*  stars being born. No wonder Brown had thought we'd found all our planets. So now you think there's [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1222.72s)]
*  another pretty big planet out here. Yeah, I am pretty dead certain that it's out there. What makes [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1229.28s)]
*  you think that? As we were studying these objects out beyond Neptune, Pluto, and the other objects, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1235.68s)]
*  and the Kuiper belt, but when you get to the most distant ones, they all look like they're being [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1242.48s)]
*  pulled off in one direction. And you think the thing that's pulling them is a big planet? Yes. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1246.88s)]
*  Couldn't there be some other explanation? We tried many different explanations trying to prove that [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1254.56s)]
*  it wasn't a planet. Nothing, nothing works. I am 100% convinced. Brown's partner, Constantine [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1259.52s)]
*  Batygin, a planetary science professor at Caltech, came up with this mathematical proof. Proof, he [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1266.88s)]
*  says, that Planet Nine is pulling those remote objects in similar oblong orbits. It looks like [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1274.16s)]
*  mathematical gibberish to our untrained eye, but Batygin told us his equation melds 10 accepted [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1281.44s)]
*  formulas, and when coupled with more than 8,000 lines of computer code, it describes Planet Nine's [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1288.5600000000002s)]
*  orbit. So, he says, he doesn't have to see it to know it exists. The mathematics proves it, and [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1295.52s)]
*  it's like being, you know, downtown and hearing an ambulance a few streets away. You haven't seen it, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1304.8799999999999s)]
*  but your other senses provide you with the information that really this ambulance is really [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1312.48s)]
*  there. Here, instead of hearing it, you see it in the math. This is a road map to Planet Nine. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1317.84s)]
*  Exactly. This, in the end, tells you where to look on the sky. To speed up the search, Batygin and [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1324.72s)]
*  Brown published their road map so other astronomers could join the hunt. Foremost among them is Scott [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1332.64s)]
*  Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution. It was Sheppard who first spotted the odd orbits in the [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1339.04s)]
*  Kuiper Belt that led Mike Brown to conclude there's a huge planet out there. Now Sheppard, like Brown, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1344.88s)]
*  compares the pictures taken on consecutive nights hoping to spot Planet Nine. We just found [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1352.08s)]
*  some more of small objects very far in the solar system that continue to show the trend that there [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1358.6399999999999s)]
*  should be a Planet Nine out there. Is it important to you whether you are the first to find it or [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1363.9199999999998s)]
*  another astronomer finds it? It'd be great to be the first one to find it. It is a race. There's a [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1369.1999999999998s)]
*  lot of people looking for it, but just to have it found is what we want. When do you think we might [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1373.52s)]
*  actually identify, spot, Planet Nine? I think that within three years we will be able to cover [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1379.6s)]
*  that swath of sky that we need to cover. Is this giant Planet Nine the last planet we'll find in [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1387.84s)]
*  our solar system or is there a Planet Ten? Is there a Planet Ten? Yeah. We don't know. Planet Nine is already far enough away that [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1396.6399999999999s)]
*  it requires the biggest telescopes we have to find it. Planet Ten is even further. Planet Nine [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1403.12s)]
*  is our generation's planet. It's the perfect planet to find right now. Planet Ten? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1409.6799999999998s)]
*  This is when I talk to kids. I tell them Planet Ten, it's yours. Go find it. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1416.8799999999999s)]
*  Now, the latest from Mars, thanks to NASA's incredibly sophisticated geologist, a one-ton rover named Curiosity that landed on Mars more than four years ago. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1421.28s)]
*  Its biggest discovery so far is this. More than three billion years ago, the planet was [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1436.32s)]
*  the only planet that existed that was ever in the habitable state of Earth. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1442.5600000000002s)]
*  But as life evolved on Earth, Mars became cold, dry, and inhospitable. Did life ever exist on Mars? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1446.5600000000002s)]
*  We don't know yet. But what is the biggest discovery so far? Mars is the only planet that existed on Earth. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1456.5600000000002s)]
*  Mars became cold, dry, and inhospitable. Did life ever exist on Mars? We don't know yet. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1464.8s)]
*  But the rover Curiosity is on the hunt and has been slowly maneuvering through a topographic [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1472.3999999999999s)]
*  treasure trove. Tonight, you'll see stunning pictures and hear what Curiosity is telling us [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1478.56s)]
*  about Mars and Earth. From Mars, Curiosity can barely see Earth more than 30 million miles away, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1485.36s)]
*  but Curiosity is seeing Mars as never before, leaving its mark, its tracks, and sending back [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1494.1599999999999s)]
*  postcards of sand dunes 20 feet tall, extending for miles, ancient stone lake beds that have been [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1501.6s)]
*  dry for billions of years, and time-lapse pictures of a Martian sunset. Like any vain photographer, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1509.04s)]
*  Curiosity poses for selfies along the way as she works to solve Mars' most challenging mysteries. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1517.52s)]
*  So we're reading the rocks with Curiosity. Reading the rocks. We read the rocks. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1524.96s)]
*  Katie Stack Morgan, a geologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, helps decide what pictures [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1530.08s)]
*  Curiosity should take and where it should go. Hundreds of scientists and engineers support [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1536.56s)]
*  the rover. They can't drive it in real time from Earth because there's a 30-minute time lag to get [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1542.72s)]
*  a message to Mars and back. So Curiosity, shown in this NASA animation, gets its instructions [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1549.28s)]
*  beamed up at the start of each day. And the rover is such a talented geologist that it can teach us [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1556.64s)]
*  a lot from a single pebble fused into a bigger rock. There's a pebble right here and it's actually [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1563.52s)]
*  quite round. And on Mars, round pebbles mean they used to be wet. And if you think about pebbles [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1571.04s)]
*  that you find in a stream on Earth, they tend to be very round as well because as they move in the [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1577.76s)]
*  streams, pebbles are hitting other pebbles and they round off all the little corners. That's how [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1582.96s)]
*  we know this deposit was formed in rushing water. I mean this is the first evidence we have from the [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1588.1599999999999s)]
*  surface that water flowed across the surface of Mars. This NASA animation is based on Mars' actual [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1594.64s)]
*  surface. Curiosity's capabilities include a laser that zaps rocks up to 23 feet away to find out [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1601.76s)]
*  what they're made of. It's the first rover that can drill for samples of Mars and analyze them [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1609.76s)]
*  in its built-in lab. An early sample told us more about that water that used to be here and led to [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1620.08s)]
*  Curiosity's biggest find so far. The water that was on the surface of Mars, you could scoop it up [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1627.1999999999998s)]
*  and drink it. Rob Manning, chief engineer at JPL, told us because the water was drinkable and because [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1632.56s)]
*  Curiosity also found essential organic chemicals, Mars could have supported life. Does that mean [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1640.0s)]
*  life was there? It doesn't. We don't know. You're talking about microbial life. Microbial single cell [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1647.36s)]
*  organisms, but if you would look for today alive, it wouldn't be on the surface. You have to go [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1652.8s)]
*  underground just like we have life on this planet. Huge amounts of life living underground on this [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1658.08s)]
*  planet. Manning told us life might have traveled back and forth between Mars and Earth. When a [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1663.04s)]
*  meteor comes along and hits Mars, a rock from Mars can be lifted up, travel then in circles around [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1670.64s)]
*  the sun until someday it will bump into Earth and land in say Antarctica. Where a rock from Mars was [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1679.6000000000001s)]
*  discovered in 1984. Right. We found Mars rock and we found them all over Earth and the reverse is [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1687.92s)]
*  also true. Certainly Earth rock with life in it has taken a trip to Mars. Could that life survive [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1695.28s)]
*  the trip? We believe 30 million miles. We don't know. We think life might be able to do that. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1702.8s)]
*  Get ready. Here's the punch line. Could have been that Mars was habitable before Earth was and life [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1710.0s)]
*  got its foothold on Mars and took its journey to Earth and we're all Martians. You know how [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1717.6s)]
*  mind-blowing that is? But it's possible. Life is amazing. Mars could have been habitable when Earth [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1726.56s)]
*  wasn't because we're looking at rocks that are very very old. How old? I mean we're talking billions of [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1732.9599999999998s)]
*  years. Why is it that we can't find rocks here that are as old as on Mars? Most of Earth is [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1739.4399999999998s)]
*  constantly recycling as the plates on the surface move around but here on Mars we don't really have [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1745.68s)]
*  evidence for plate tectonics. This is the Mars rock record of Mars history preserved at the surface [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1751.2s)]
*  and that's a really unique opportunity to explore a time in the solar system that may not be [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1757.44s)]
*  preserved on the surface of Earth. The scariest part of the entire mission was Curiosity's landing [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1762.48s)]
*  on Mars. It couldn't bounce onto Mars cushioned by giant airbags the way smaller rovers had [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1768.88s)]
*  Curiosity weighs a ton too big for the bags so lead engineer Adam Steltzner and his team [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1775.8400000000001s)]
*  came up with a bizarre plan to pack Curiosity into a flying saucer fire rockets to slow its descent [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1782.96s)]
*  and then use long cables to lower it onto Mars. Many here thought they were crazy. The team [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1792.3200000000002s)]
*  recognized that if we failed we would find no comfort or solace from the general public. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1800.56s)]
*  There would be a lot of singers pointed. The man on the street says that looks crazy I could have [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1807.68s)]
*  told you it was crazy and so I developed this little statement I would make before I'd even [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1811.76s)]
*  start. It goes like this great works and great folly may be indistinguishable at the outset. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1817.12s)]
*  Because of the communication time lag they could not direct the landing from Earth. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1825.84s)]
*  The complex maneuvers were pre-programmed. Steltzner and his team could only wait and worry. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1831.28s)]
*  We were just sitting in the control room [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1838.56s)]
*  Pacing back and forth trying to remember to breathe. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1841.12s)]
*  Here's animation of the landing [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1847.6s)]
*  and the actual reaction at mission control. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1855.44s)]
*  The team celebrated and then sometime in the wee hours of the morning I went home, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1864.32s)]
*  crawled into bed with my wife and wept because I was spent. I was overwhelmed. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1870.16s)]
*  This is where Curiosity landed. The smudges on the left. They look like burn marks but they're not. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1877.92s)]
*  They're dust clearing marks. This is where the the rockets cleared the dust away. I see a trail. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1884.48s)]
*  That's right so these are the tracks of the rover. So the rover landed here and then it drove along [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1890.8000000000002s)]
*  made a couple of turns and you can actually see this from orbit which is incredible. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1897.36s)]
*  NASA's been sending satellites to Mars for more than 50 years. Three are orbiting Mars now [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1903.36s)]
*  monitoring its weather and sending back images of giant craters, wind carved ridges and an avalanche [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1909.9199999999998s)]
*  of sand pouring down a mountain kicking up huge clouds of dust. Down on the surface one of the [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1918.08s)]
*  three earlier rovers continues to operate. Opportunity is just one-fifth the size of [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1925.12s)]
*  Curiosity. It can't scoop up samples or analyze the surface the way Curiosity can [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1931.28s)]
*  but Opportunity has been snapping stunning pictures for 13 years while Curiosity's mission [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1937.92s)]
*  almost ended after just six months. We had had some sort of the overhead some sort of memory problem. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1945.52s)]
*  Rob Manning told us a computer glitch came within one hour of stopping communication with Curiosity [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1952.24s)]
*  forever. The rover has two identical computers called pilot and co-pilot. The pilot is supposed [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1959.28s)]
*  to have enough self-diagnosis. It'd be smart enough to say I'm not doing very well. I'm not feeling [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1966.3200000000002s)]
*  well. I'm gonna let the co-pilot take over. Yet pilot was not doing well and refused to give up [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1972.24s)]
*  control. In fact it started acting a bit like it had an attitude. The computer had an attitude. The [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1979.76s)]
*  computer has developed an attitude in a way that we've never said never seen before. When we told [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1985.28s)]
*  it to go take a nap it refused to take a nap. Then it refused to take pictures. Then it refused to do [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1990.24s)]
*  more science throughout the day and was like it just stopped doing these things. I was like what the [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1994.8s)]
*  heck is going on? And time is running out. Time is running out because in an hour it's going to turn [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=1998.8s)]
*  radio off and stay off forever and we'll lose this very expensive rover. Manning's team sent an order [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2003.92s)]
*  to kill the pilot hoping that would force the co-pilot to take over. We're waiting for the co-pilot [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2010.8s)]
*  to wake up and then turn on its radio to let us know that it was alive. We should get a signal. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2017.6000000000001s)]
*  Nothing. Another minute goes by. Nothing. Four minutes go by. Now we're starting to get really [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2023.04s)]
*  worried. It sounds like a movie. It really was getting nerve-wracking and bing! There is a signal [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2030.0s)]
*  and the backup pilot is obviously in charge. And so the backup pilot's still in charge today? The [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2037.52s)]
*  backup pilot's still in charge. We have since repaired the bad pilot. To help direct the pilot [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2042.64s)]
*  the Jet Propulsion Lab built its own patch of Mars where they can practice maneuvers with the [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2049.52s)]
*  rover's twin. Adam Steltzner told us the rover can see where it's going and make mid-course [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2054.88s)]
*  corrections to avoid pitfalls. Why is she so slow? We are exploring. We don't want to miss anything. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2061.44s)]
*  So she moves deliberately. So Katie Stack Morgan can study everything Curiosity sees. This is [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2069.76s)]
*  actually an active dune field. What do you mean by an active dune field? It means that the sand [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2078.96s)]
*  particles that are making up the dunes are still moving today. Being blown across the landscape. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2083.2s)]
*  They're very slowly being moved across the surface. Because of the Martian wind? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2089.8399999999997s)]
*  Everybody we talk to talks about how studying Mars helps us better understand Earth. How so? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2096.7999999999997s)]
*  When we look at rocks on Mars we are potentially seeing a snapshot of our solar system at a [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2105.2799999999997s)]
*  time before Earth developed its environment as we know it. It's really like we were there. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2113.12s)]
*  Now Curiosity has started climbing part way up Mount Sharp. That's why it landed nearby. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2121.04s)]
*  The mountain is a layer cake of history. Each ascending layer revealing how Mars changed over [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2128.0s)]
*  time. The layers at the bottom those are the older layers and each successive layer is younger and [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2135.12s)]
*  younger and younger. As you climb the mountain what do you expect to find? What do you hope to [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2140.16s)]
*  find? We're actually expecting to see that transition when Mars transitioned from being [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2146.16s)]
*  a habitable planet to being one that was not habitable. What happened to the atmosphere of Mars [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2152.16s)]
*  to turn it into this almost dead planet? It cooled. It lost its magnetic field. The solar wind blew [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2157.92s)]
*  away its atmosphere and so it dried out. It became a prune of its former self. We're still a plum. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2164.72s)]
*  It's a prune. What does that Martian history tell us about Earth? I don't think we have to worry [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2171.2799999999997s)]
*  about drying out like Mars. But it does teach us of how delicate the balance of our environment is. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2178.24s)]
*  And so it should heighten our appreciation of what a beautiful warm wet hug living here on Earth really is. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2190.32s)]
*  For a long time astronomers saw the asteroids and comets that come close to Earth as useless debris. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2210.7200000000003s)]
*  Space rocks that blocked our view of distant galaxies. Not anymore. They're now viewed as [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2216.3199999999997s)]
*  scientifically important and potentially very dangerous if they were to collide with our planet. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2221.7599999999998s)]
*  The odds of that happening on any given day are remote but over millions of years scientists [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2226.8799999999997s)]
*  believe there have been lots of impacts and few doubt there are more to come. A former [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2231.8399999999997s)]
*  astronaut told us it's like a game of cosmic roulette and one mankind cannot afford to lose. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2237.2799999999997s)]
*  Concern over our ability to detect these objects that come near the Earth [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2244.4s)]
*  grew after an incident in Russia this February when an asteroid crashed into the atmosphere [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2248.56s)]
*  with many times the energy of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, narrowly missing a city of one million. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2253.92s)]
*  This is video of that asteroid in Russia barreling toward Earth at 40,000 miles an hour. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2261.2799999999997s)]
*  It exploded into pieces 19 miles above and 25 miles south of the city of Chelyabinsk. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2267.92s)]
*  People thought it had missed them entirely until minutes later when the shock wave arrived. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2274.88s)]
*  Shattering glass, crushing doors and knocking some people right off their feet. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2283.28s)]
*  More than a thousand were injured. How much warning did people in Chelyabinsk have? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2288.8s)]
*  None. Paul Chodis is a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2294.0s)]
*  He and his boss Don Yeomans have been trying to track near-Earth objects for decades. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2300.08s)]
*  We didn't see it coming. It was coming from the general direction of the sun [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2305.12s)]
*  so it was in the daytime sky as it approached. So how did you find out about it? Twitter and YouTube [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2309.2s)]
*  when we first saw the images. So the first people at NASA heard about it was Twitter? Exactly. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2314.08s)]
*  Chodis says an object this size hits Earth once every hundred years on average. Yet the same day, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2320.88s)]
*  purely by chance, another asteroid twice as large came within 17,000 miles of Earth, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2327.04s)]

*  The only reason there was any advance warning was because an amateur astronomer in Spain, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2337.92s)]
*  an oral surgeon by day, noticed it just before it moved out of view. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2343.12s)]
*  We know about some of the most distant galaxies in the known universe and yet we don't really [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2347.7599999999998s)]
*  know everything that's right in our own backyard. Wow. Amy Mainzer is a NASA scientist who focuses [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2352.08s)]
*  on detecting asteroids. So we got to move the dome out of the way and then we're going to start to [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2357.68s)]
*  follow the asteroid as it tracks across the sky. This telescope at the Table Mountain Observatory [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2362.7999999999997s)]
*  in California is one of dozens all over the world that are used to track and study near-Earth objects. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2368.4s)]
*  Mainzer told us they're often very hard to find. Some of these asteroids are really, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2374.64s)]
*  really dark, darker even than coal in some cases, kind of like the soot at the bottom of a barbecue [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2379.44s)]
*  grill. So you're looking for something that's darker than coal against a black sky. Exactly. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2384.24s)]
*  And now you see the problem. Another problem is that ground-based telescopes can't see objects [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2389.2s)]
*  coming from the direction of the sun because they're in the daytime sky, like the asteroid [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2395.04s)]
*  that hit Russia. Astronomers find asteroids by taking repeated pictures of the night sky [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2399.84s)]
*  and looking for things that change position. Professionals and amateurs all over the world [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2405.84s)]
*  work together sharing information. Once Paul Chodis and his NASA colleagues have multiple sightings, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2410.88s)]
*  they can predict an object's location as far as a hundred years into the future. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2417.28s)]
*  This particular object has a very well-known orbit. The asteroid Amy Mainzer was observing [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2422.48s)]
*  the night we visited didn't look like much on her screen. That little thing? Yep, that's it. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2427.04s)]
*  But it's nearly half a mile wide and capable of destroying an entire continent. So that's actually [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2432.4s)]
*  that's a huge asteroid. Yeah, it's a huge asteroid. Something this size hit the Earth, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2438.48s)]
*  it would be devastating. It would be very bad. Asteroids are composed mostly of rock, comets, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2442.08s)]
*  ice and dust. They come in all shapes and sizes. Some look like small planets, others giant dog [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2447.68s)]
*  bones. For a long time, nobody thought they were worth tracking at all. It wasn't thought that they [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2454.96s)]
*  really did hit the Earth. Astronomers debated for a long time about the nature of the craters on the [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2460.48s)]
*  moon. They thought the craters on the moon were volcanic? Possibly, yeah. And it's only been [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2466.2400000000002s)]
*  fairly recently within, you know, the last 50 years or so that the field has really recognized [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2470.56s)]
*  that, yeah, impacts actually do happen. And not only do they happen on geological timescales, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2474.8s)]
*  millions and billions of years, but on human timescales in some cases. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2480.56s)]
*  The last major asteroid to collide with Earth hit in 1908 in the Tunguska region of Siberia. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2485.6s)]
*  It's believed to have been 40 yards wide and to have exploded in the air like a nuclear bomb, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2491.92s)]
*  leveling 80 million trees in an area the size of metropolitan Washington. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2497.52s)]
*  This crater in northern Arizona was created 50,000 years ago. It's one of more than 180 impact craters [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2502.7999999999997s)]
*  geologists have found so far. They think there are many more hidden by water and vegetation, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2509.92s)]
*  more even than on the moon because the Earth's gravity is greater. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2516.0s)]
*  The most famous impact of all is the one that may have wiped out the dinosaurs more than 65 million [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2520.2400000000002s)]
*  years ago. The theory is that an enormous asteroid or comet collided so violently with Earth, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2525.76s)]
*  it created a cloud of debris that blocked out the sun, killing off 75 percent of all species, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2531.92s)]
*  leaving behind a crater in Mexico more than 100 miles wide. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2538.64s)]
*  These are objects that were once in space, pieces of asteroids. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2543.2s)]
*  Jomans and Chodas showed us some of the remarkable things that have fallen from the sky. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2548.16s)]
*  This is a piece of Mars. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2553.2799999999997s)]
*  You have it in your hand. It wandered around the inner solar system for a few million years, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2554.24s)]
*  and a 40-pound stone came down in Africa about 10 feet from a farmer in October of 1962. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2559.12s)]
*  It's from Mars. They played a trick on me as well. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2567.84s)]
*  Say, would you hand that one to me? That big one? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2571.6s)]
*  This one was iron nickel and heavy as an anvil. Not all asteroids are made of such dense stuff, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2578.48s)]
*  but many contain high concentrations of valuable minerals like platinum that might someday be [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2584.7200000000003s)]
*  mined in space. We'll start by sending astronauts to an asteroid for the first time in history. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2590.4s)]
*  President Obama's proposed budget for next year includes a plan to capture a tiny asteroid [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2596.16s)]
*  so that astronauts could rendezvous with it by 2025. The idea is to perfect techniques needed [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2601.3599999999997s)]
*  to explore deep space and perhaps find a way to exploit the water resources that many comets [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2607.3599999999997s)]
*  and asteroids have. You could extract water from them. You can break the water down into hydrogen [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2613.8399999999997s)]
*  and oxygen, which is the most efficient form of rocket fuel. So asteroids may serve as the [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2618.96s)]
*  fueling stations and watering holes for future planetary exploration. But as the script writers [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2624.56s)]
*  of the Hollywood blockbuster Armageddon vividly imagined, asteroids have the potential to harm [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2630.0s)]
*  mankind as well. For better or worse, this is what many of us know about near-Earth objects, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2635.36s)]
*  that if Bruce Willis hadn't nuked one, it would have destroyed the world. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2642.72s)]
*  You see these movies with Bruce Willis where an asteroid is coming and is going to [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2647.44s)]
*  destroy the world. Is that likely? No, no. We found 95% of the large ones and none of them [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2651.52s)]
*  represent a threat in the next hundred years or so. What about the other 5%? We're still looking. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2659.12s)]
*  He's talking about objects over half a mile wide that are big enough to cause global destruction. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2665.12s)]
*  The problem is there are lots of smaller objects over 40 yards in diameter that are unaccounted for [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2671.2s)]
*  and potentially very dangerous. If you look at the light green dot, that's the orbit of the Earth. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2677.2s)]
*  Ed Liu is a former astronaut who spent six months on the International Space Station. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2682.56s)]
*  He showed us a computer-generated representation of our solar system. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2687.12s)]
*  That's the sun in the center and those green dots are 10,000 near-Earth objects [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2691.2799999999997s)]
*  astronomers have found so far. So these green dots are the asteroids that could hit the Earth. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2696.3999999999996s)]
*  This is about the 10,000 known asteroids. Yes, these are the 10,000 known asteroids. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2701.68s)]
*  Here's the problem. There's about a factor of 100 more. The real solar system looks like this. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2706.4s)]
*  And we know this because we've only been able to observe a small fraction of the sky [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2711.44s)]
*  and we know that there's about 100 times more asteroids. This is all the asteroids that are... [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2715.6800000000003s)]
*  There are about a million asteroids large enough to destroy a city out there. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2719.6800000000003s)]
*  And right now we only know of what percent of those asteroids? About one half of one percent. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2723.12s)]
*  Does it worry you that you only know one percent of these asteroids that are [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2728.88s)]
*  big enough to destroy a city? Well, most of those are really small and the odds are that [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2733.68s)]
*  many of these would hit in a remote area or could hit in an ocean. So that is why the larger ones [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2738.3199999999997s)]
*  are those that we were paying attention to first. Now the next size range is the one to concentrate [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2745.3599999999997s)]
*  on. Those that can cause, you know, continent-wide extinction or destruction. Yeah, that would be [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2750.3199999999997s)]
*  pretty good to prevent that continent-wide destruction. Those are the next ones. We'll [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2756.7999999999997s)]
*  continue to find those and we work our way down to the small ones. But right now an object that [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2762.4s)]
*  could wipe out the eastern seaboard or New York City could be a day away and there's a very good [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2769.44s)]
*  chance we wouldn't know about it. Well, we're working to make sure that we will know about it. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2776.88s)]
*  But right now we wouldn't know about it. It's possible. Yes. The committee on science, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2780.64s)]
*  space and technology will come to order. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden faced similar [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2785.28s)]
*  questions from Congress after the near miss in Russia earlier this year. What would we do [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2790.8s)]
*  if you detected even a small one like the one that detonated in Russia headed for New York City [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2796.88s)]
*  in three weeks? What would we do? If it's coming in three weeks, pray. Is there anything you can [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2805.84s)]
*  do to deflect an asteroid that's going to hit besides evacuating a city? If you find it 10 or [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2811.76s)]
*  20 or 30 years in advance, then yes, you could actually send a spacecraft up or run into it, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2817.92s)]
*  slow it down a millimeter or two per second so that in 10 or 20 years when it was predicted [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2824.56s)]
*  to hit the earth, it wouldn't. Just slam a spacecraft into it? Just slam into it. In 2005, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2828.8s)]
*  NASA did just that as an experiment firing a small unmanned spacecraft into a comet called Temple 1. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2834.16s)]
*  But you can't deflect what you don't detect, which is why former astronaut Ed Lu has taken [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2841.44s)]
*  on a new mission. Here's the telescope that we're building. He's now chairman of the B612 Foundation, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2847.04s)]
*  which has designed a space-based telescope to speed up the discovery of near-earth objects. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2852.56s)]
*  NASA's Amy Manzer has been developing one too. Both telescopes would be able to find asteroids [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2858.4s)]
*  by using infrared sensors that detect heat rather than light. But a telescope like this would cost [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2864.16s)]
*  roughly half a billion dollars, and so far neither the United States nor any other government has [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2870.72s)]
*  committed significant funds. So the B612 Foundation is trying to raise the money privately [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2875.92s)]
*  by reaching out to individual donors. I don't think there's any other global catastrophe, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2881.28s)]
*  global scale catastrophe that we can prevent. This is the only one that I know of. We can solve [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2888.2400000000002s)]
*  this particular issue for the cost of building a freeway overpass. I mean, that's literally what [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2892.96s)]
*  it is. But nobody has been killed by an asteroid. Yeah, and what I'm saying is that you can't wait [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2897.6800000000003s)]
*  to that point afterwards when you say we should have done it. You have to think of this as cosmic [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2903.28s)]
*  roulette, right? The phrase that they have in Vegas is that the house always wins. And, you know, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2907.84s)]
*  the sort of secret to all this is that we're not the house. At some point, you know, the solar system [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2912.8s)]
*  is going to get you. They're very low probability events, but very high consequence events. The [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2919.28s)]
*  problem, it seems like, is you're asking people to care about something which may not affect [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2924.7200000000003s)]
*  their lives, may not even affect their children's lives. That's true. It's a tough concept to get [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2931.36s)]
*  across because, as you say, it's something that may not happen for another 100 years, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2935.6800000000003s)]
*  200 years. It may happen tomorrow morning. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlALC1Pmv4&t=2940.4s)]
