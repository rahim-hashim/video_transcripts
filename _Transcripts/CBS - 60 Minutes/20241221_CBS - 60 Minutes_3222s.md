**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [December 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA)
*  The First Pope from the Americas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=0.0s)]
*  Francis is the first pope from the Americas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=12.8s)]
*  The first of his name, and more than any other pope in recent memory, has dedicated his life [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=16.4s)]
*  and ministry to the poor, the peripheral, and the forgotten. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=21.92s)]
*  All while leading the Catholic Church on difficult, sometimes controversial issues that not everyone supports. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=26.48s)]
*  We were granted a rare interview at the Vatican and spoke to him in his native Spanish through [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=33.68s)]
*  a translator for more than an hour. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=39.0s)]
*  Not lost in translation was the 87-year-old's warmth, intelligence, and conviction. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=42.36s)]
*  We began by discussing the Church's First World Children's Day. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=48.78s)]
*  Next weekend, Pope Francis will welcome tens of thousands of young people to the Vatican, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=52.96s)]
*  including refugees of war. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  During World Children's Day, the UN says over a million people will be facing famine in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=62.44s)]
*  Gaza, many of them children. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=68.2s)]
*  Not just in Gaza. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=73.4s)]
*  Think of Ukraine. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=74.84s)]
*  Many kids from Ukraine come here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=77.36s)]
*  You know something? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=81.04s)]
*  That those children don't know how to smile. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=82.64s)]
*  I'll say something to them. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  They have forgotten how to smile. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=90.76s)]
*  And that is very painful. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=93.0s)]
*  Do you have a message for Vladimir Putin when it comes to Ukraine? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=95.36000000000001s)]
*  Please, warring countries, all of them, stop. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=100.28s)]
*  Stop the war. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  You must find a way of negotiating for peace. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=107.98s)]
*  Strive for peace. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=111.34s)]
*  A negotiated peace is always better than an endless war. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=113.34s)]
*  What's happening in Israel and Gaza has caused so much division, so much pain around the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=120.98s)]
*  world. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=129.06s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen in the United States big protests on college campuses and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=130.06s)]
*  growing anti-Semitism. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=137.16s)]
*  What would you say about how to change that? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=139.26s)]
*  All ideology is bad. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  And anti-Semitism is an ideology. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=146.66s)]
*  And it is bad. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=149.14s)]
*  Any anti is always bad. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=151.26s)]
*  You can criticize one government or another. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=153.9s)]
*  The government of Israel, the Palestinian government. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=157.54s)]
*  You can criticize all you want. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=160.8s)]
*  But not anti a people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=163.02s)]
*  Neither anti-Palestinian nor anti-Semitic. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=166.14s)]
*  No. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=168.89999999999998s)]
*  I know you call for peace. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=170.05999999999997s)]
*  You have called for a ceasefire in many of your sermons. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  Can you help negotiate peace? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=176.61999999999998s)]
*  What I can do is pray. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=179.45999999999998s)]
*  I pray a lot for peace. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=182.94s)]
*  And also to suggest, please stop, negotiate. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=185.17999999999998s)]
*  Francis's career has been at the center of the pope's life since he was born Jorge Mario [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=190.98s)]
*  Bergoglio in Argentina in 1936 into a family of Italian immigrants. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=195.45999999999998s)]
*  Before entering the seminary, Bergoglio worked as a chemist. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=202.66s)]
*  His own personal formula is simplicity. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=206.94s)]
*  He still wears the plain silver cross he wore as the Archbishop of Buenos Aires. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=210.54s)]
*  Though it's not what Francis wears, but where he lives that set the tone for his papacy [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=217.14s)]
*  11 years ago. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=223.17999999999998s)]
*  Instead of a palace above St. Peter's Square, he chose the Vatican guesthouse, Casa Santa [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=225.33999999999997s)]
*  Marta, as his home. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=231.22s)]
*  We met him there under a painting of the Virgin Mary. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  Surrounded by the sacred, Francis has not forsaken his sense of humor, even when discussing [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=238.29999999999998s)]
*  serious subjects like the migrant crisis. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=245.29999999999998s)]
*  My grandparents were Catholic, immigrated from Northern Ireland in the 1930s to the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=248.18s)]
*  United States, seeking a better life. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=254.42s)]
*  And I know your family too, fled fascism. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=258.1s)]
*  And you have talked about with migrants, many of them children, that you encourage governments [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=261.86s)]
*  to build bridges, not walls. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=267.26s)]
*  Migration is something that makes a country grow. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=272.02000000000004s)]
*  They say that you Irish migrated and brought the whiskey. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=276.74s)]
*  Or that the Italians migrated and brought the mafia. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=281.66s)]
*  It's a joke, don't take it badly. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  But migrants sometimes suffer a lot. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=293.18s)]
*  They suffer a lot. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=295.66s)]
*  I grew up in Texas, and I don't know if you've heard, but the state of Texas is attempting [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=298.5s)]
*  to shut down a Catholic charity on the border with Mexico that offers undocumented migrants [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=303.5s)]
*  humanitarian assistance. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=310.85999999999996s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=313.5s)]
*  That is madness, sheer madness. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=317.14s)]
*  To close the border and leave them there, that is madness. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=319.78s)]
*  The migrant has to be received. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=324.14s)]
*  The later after you see how you're going to deal with them, maybe you have to send them back. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=326.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=330.98s)]
*  But each case ought to be considered humanely, right? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=331.98s)]
*  A few months after becoming Pope, Francis went to a small Italian island near Africa [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=337.78s)]
*  to meet migrants fleeing poverty and war. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=343.78s)]
*  Your first trip as Pope was the island of Lampedusa, where you talked about suffering. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=347.94s)]
*  You were so struck when you talked about the globalization of indifference. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=355.41999999999996s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=360.41999999999996s)]
*  Do you want me to state it plainly? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=361.41999999999996s)]
*  People wash their hands. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=365.34s)]
*  There are so many Pontius Pilots of the loose out there who see what is happening, the wars, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=367.02s)]
*  the injustice, the crimes. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=374.17999999999995s)]
*  That's okay, that's okay, and wash their hands. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=379.29999999999995s)]
*  When it's indifference, that is what happens when the heart hardens and becomes indifferent. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=383.98s)]
*  Please, we have to get our hearts to feel again. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=389.98s)]
*  We cannot remain indifferent in the face of such human dramas. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=394.98s)]
*  The globalization of indifference is a very ugly disease, very ugly. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=399.98s)]
*  Pope Francis has not been indifferent to the Church's most insidious scandal, the rampant [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=407.74s)]
*  sexual abuse of hundreds of thousands of children worldwide for decades. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=416.5s)]
*  You have done more than anyone to try and reform the Catholic Church and repent for [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=422.38s)]
*  years of unspeakable sexual abuse against children by members of the clergy. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=426.82s)]
*  But has the Church done enough? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=432.34000000000003s)]
*  Must continue to do more. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=435.94s)]
*  Unfortunately, the tragedy of the abuses is enormous. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=438.06s)]
*  And against this, an upright conscience. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=442.94s)]
*  And not only to not permit it, but to put in place the conditions so that it does not [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=446.46s)]
*  happen. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=451.02s)]
*  You have said zero tolerance. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=453.46s)]
*  It cannot be tolerated. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=457.38s)]
*  When there is a case of a religious man or woman who abuses, the full force of the law [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=459.78s)]
*  falls upon them. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=465.14s)]
*  In this there has been a great deal of progress. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=466.82s)]
*  It's Francis' capacity for forgiveness and openness that has defined his leadership of [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=471.9s)]
*  the Church's nearly 1.4 billion Catholics. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=477.34s)]
*  He put them and the world on notice during an impromptu press conference on a plane in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=481.46s)]
*  2013, when he spoke on the subject of homosexuality. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=486.82s)]
*  If someone is gay, he said, and he searches for the Lord and has goodwill, who am I to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=493.02s)]
*  judge? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=499.21999999999997s)]
*  And he did not stop there. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=500.53999999999996s)]
*  Last year you decided to allow Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=502.94s)]
*  That's a big change. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=508.29999999999995s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=509.78s)]
*  No, what I allowed was not to bless the union. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=510.78s)]
*  That cannot be done because that is not the sacrament. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=517.46s)]
*  I cannot. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=521.5s)]
*  The Lord made it that way. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=522.78s)]
*  But to bless each person? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=524.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=526.3s)]
*  The blessing is for everyone. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=527.3s)]
*  For everyone. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=531.9s)]
*  To bless a homosexual type union, however, goes against the given right, against the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=533.38s)]
*  law of the Church. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=541.38s)]
*  But to bless each person? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=544.46s)]
*  Why not? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=547.7s)]
*  The blessing is for all. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=548.7s)]
*  Some people were scandalized by this, but why? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=551.26s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=554.9s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=555.9s)]
*  You have said, who am I to judge? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=556.9s)]
*  Homosexuality is not a crime. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=561.7s)]
*  No, it's a human fact. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=563.42s)]
*  There are conservative bishops in the United States that oppose your new efforts to revisit [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=567.02s)]
*  teachings and traditions. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=573.18s)]
*  How do you address their criticism? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=575.26s)]
*  You used an adjective, conservative. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=579.66s)]
*  That is, conservative is one who clings to something and does not want to see beyond [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=584.14s)]
*  that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=589.8199999999999s)]
*  It is a suicidal attitude. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=590.8199999999999s)]
*  Because one thing is to take tradition into account, to consider situations from the past. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=594.54s)]
*  But quite another is to be closed up inside a dogmatic box. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=601.02s)]
*  Pope Francis has placed more women in positions of power than any of his predecessors, but [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=606.78s)]
*  he told us he opposes allowing women to be ordained as priests or deacons. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=612.98s)]
*  Francis' devotion to traditional doctrine led one Vatican reporter to note that he's [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=620.06s)]
*  changed the tune of the Church, but the lyrics essentially remain the same. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=625.22s)]
*  This frustrates those who want to see him change policy on Roman Catholic priests marrying, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=630.54s)]
*  contraception and surrogate motherhood. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=636.7s)]
*  I know women who are cancer survivors, who cannot bear children, and they turn to surrogacy. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=639.98s)]
*  This is against Church doctrine. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=649.12s)]
*  In regard to surrogate motherhood, in the strictest sense of the term, no, it is not [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=652.58s)]
*  authorized. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=657.6600000000001s)]
*  Sometimes, surrogacy has become a business, and that is very bad. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=658.6600000000001s)]
*  It is very bad. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=663.58s)]
*  But sometimes, for some women, it is the only hope. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=665.94s)]
*  It could be. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=668.7s)]
*  The other hope is adoption. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=670.86s)]
*  I would say that in each case, the situation should be carefully and clearly considered, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=673.46s)]
*  consulting medically and then morally as well. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=681.4200000000001s)]
*  I think there is a general rule in these cases, but you have to go into each case in particular [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=686.82s)]
*  to assess the situation, as long as the moral principle is not skirted. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=693.78s)]
*  But you are right. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=702.78s)]
*  I want to tell you that I really liked your expression when you told me, in some cases, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=703.78s)]
*  it is the only chance. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=710.54s)]
*  It shows that you feel these things very deeply. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=712.94s)]
*  I think that is why so many people have found hope with you, because you have been more [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=717.94s)]
*  open and accepting, perhaps, than other previous leaders of the Church. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=724.34s)]
*  You have to be open to everything. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=733.9000000000001s)]
*  The Church is like that. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=736.58s)]
*  Everyone, everyone, everyone. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=738.1400000000001s)]
*  That so-and-so is a sinner. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=741.34s)]
*  Me too, I am a sinner. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=743.1s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=744.9000000000001s)]
*  The Gospel is for everyone. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=745.9s)]
*  If the Church places a customs officer at the door, that is no longer the Church of [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=747.86s)]
*  Christ. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=753.1s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=755.3s)]
*  When you look at the world, what gives you hope? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=758.62s)]
*  Everything. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=763.02s)]
*  You see tragedies, but you also see so many beautiful things. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=764.02s)]
*  You see heroic mothers, heroic men, men who have hopes and dreams, women who look to [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=774.7s)]
*  the future. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=781.9000000000001s)]
*  That gives me a lot of hope. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=782.9000000000001s)]
*  People want to live, people forge ahead, and people are fundamentally good. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=787.7800000000001s)]
*  We are all fundamentally good. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=797.0600000000001s)]
*  Yes, there are some rogues and sinners, but the heart itself is good. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=799.3000000000001s)]
*  Almost exactly four years ago, the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris caught fire. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=813.58s)]
*  It was one of those 21st century moments that people around the world experienced together, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=819.4200000000001s)]
*  staring in horror at live video on their smartphones and televisions. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=825.26s)]
*  For the people of France, it was especially traumatic, because Notre Dame has been a powerful [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=830.14s)]
*  symbol both sacred and secular since medieval times. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=835.8199999999999s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron pledged that Notre Dame would be reopened by the end of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=840.14s)]
*  2024. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=845.34s)]
*  He couldn't have known then how hard it would be to keep that promise. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=847.14s)]
*  But on this Easter Sunday, four years later, the resurrection of the great cathedral seems [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=851.5s)]
*  within reach. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=857.78s)]
*  Flames tore through the roof of Notre Dame on the evening of April 15, 2019, and spread [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=862.78s)]
*  with incredible speed and ferocity, engulfing her 200-foot spire. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=871.02s)]
*  Jean-Louis Jurgelin is the man now in charge of restoring Notre Dame. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=879.02s)]
*  And a lot of people in France cry because they feel that something very deep in the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=884.34s)]
*  soul of France, in the spirit of France, was about to collapse. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=892.1s)]
*  Only a heroic effort by the Paris Fire Brigade saved Notre Dame from collapse as a few staffers [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=899.86s)]
*  raced through falling embers to rescue precious relics. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=906.58s)]
*  Philippe Villeneuve, the cathedral's chief architect, was out of town that night and [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=911.5400000000001s)]
*  raced back to Paris. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=916.26s)]
*  He was devastated by what he saw. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=918.0600000000001s)]
*  I've said that the little boy who was in love with the cathedral and the architect who was [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=921.98s)]
*  in charge of it died that day. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=927.0600000000001s)]
*  And another man took over and said, I have to save the cathedral. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=929.62s)]
*  It's my mission. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=934.86s)]
*  It's my duty. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=936.02s)]
*  Villeneuve now shares that duty. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=937.02s)]
*  If he's the artist who knows every inch of stone in Notre Dame, retired army general [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=940.1s)]
*  Jurgelin is the commander called back to meet that five-year deadline. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=945.82s)]
*  I will relax only when this will be done. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=950.86s)]
*  What does this cathedral mean to the people of France? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=955.22s)]
*  The cathedral, Notre Dame de Paris, is in some way the heart of France. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=959.34s)]
*  For the Catholic, of course, for the Christian, but for everybody. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=964.78s)]
*  All the great events of France in some way or another took place here in the cathedral. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=968.9399999999999s)]
*  Napoleon crowned himself emperor in Notre Dame in 1804. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=974.8199999999999s)]
*  In 1944, as Paris was liberated from Nazi occupation, General Charles de Gaulle braved [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=979.8199999999999s)]
*  sniper fire to enter the cathedral. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=986.42s)]
*  In many ways you could say that she's the people's palace. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=991.9399999999999s)]
*  Agnès Prarier is a journalist and author who lives and works just across the river [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=995.42s)]
*  Seine from Notre Dame. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1000.66s)]
*  She and her neighbors watched the most horrifying moment the night of the fire, the collapse [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1002.4599999999999s)]
*  of that imposing spire. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1007.6999999999999s)]
*  I remember the scream of the crowd saying no, as if they couldn't, they couldn't conceive [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1013.26s)]
*  That spire meant so much to Philippe Villeneuve that he had it tattooed on his arm. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1022.22s)]
*  They say that I have Notre Dame in my skin, he told us. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1028.22s)]
*  It's very practical because when I have to explain how the spire fell, it's always better [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1034.22s)]
*  to show that from here to there it tipped over. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1040.42s)]
*  The huge spire made of oak and covered in lead tiles crashed through two of the stone [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1045.34s)]
*  vaults which formed the ceiling of Notre Dame, leaving gaping holes at the top and heaps [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1051.78s)]
*  of broken stone and charred wood on the floor below. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1057.3s)]
*  The top priority was to shore up the grand cathedral's weakened structure. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1063.3799999999999s)]
*  Huge temporary wooden supports were placed under the surviving stone vaults of her ceiling [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1069.3799999999999s)]
*  and under the flying buttresses to save this prime example of medieval engineering. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1075.5800000000002s)]
*  We have to check every stone in the cathedral, every pillar. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1081.5s)]
*  At the same time, a huge decontamination project was mounted to remove lead tiles that had [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1085.74s)]
*  melted from the burning roof and spire and all the toxic lead dust spread by the fire. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1091.66s)]
*  Four years on, workers still take extraordinary precautions against lead poisoning. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1098.7s)]
*  He had to wear disposable hazmat suits to enter the cathedral. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1104.04s)]
*  Tons of rubble had to be removed. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1108.72s)]
*  Paintings and stained glass windows were taken away for restoration and twisted steel scaffolding [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1111.28s)]
*  erected for ongoing restoration work had to be dismantled. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1117.56s)]
*  So you were in the process of restoring the spire when the fire broke out in 2019. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1122.48s)]
*  Did your restoration project have anything to do with the fire breaking out? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1129.24s)]
*  An investigation is still underway, Philippe Villeneuve told us, and no cause of the fire [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1137.76s)]
*  has been identified. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1143.0s)]
*  But personally, it's unbearable. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1144.96s)]
*  This fire never should have happened, and it did. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1147.64s)]
*  Inevitably, I feel responsible. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1150.8s)]
*  At that point in our interview, Villeneuve switched to English with a rueful smile. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1155.12s)]
*  In reality, I'm totally destroyed. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1160.12s)]
*  Really? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1167.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1168.12s)]
*  I so want to rebuild Notre Dame, it's because I want to rebuild myself. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1169.12s)]
*  The fire's deeply emotional impact on Philippe Villeneuve was mirrored around the world. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1176.04s)]
*  Nearly a billion dollars in private donations have been pledged to rebuild Notre Dame, most [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1184.04s)]
*  of it from France, 50 million dollars from Americans. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1190.24s)]
*  I know many people in the United States contributed. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1195.0s)]
*  They can contribute again. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1198.36s)]
*  They can continue to contribute. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1199.36s)]
*  The cash is always running. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1201.8799999999999s)]
*  If I want, give me money, I need. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1203.48s)]
*  In the weeks immediately following the fire, all sorts of ideas were floated for how centuries-old [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1205.76s)]
*  Notre Dame might be given a touch of avant-garde. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1211.94s)]
*  And all those architects throughout the world said, yes, let's have a roof garden, let's [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1216.42s)]
*  have a golden torch, let's have a titanium spire. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1220.78s)]
*  You know, even I, for 20 seconds, I thought, hmm, to add some 21st century genius to Notre [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1225.74s)]
*  Dame, why not? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1232.54s)]
*  Chief architect Philippe Villeneuve had a very simple answer, why not? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1234.38s)]
*  An historic monument, a cathedral, is not something to be played with, he told us. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1240.3000000000002s)]
*  Notre Dame had been standing for 850 years with a wooden frame and a lead roof. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1247.3000000000002s)]
*  So wood is the way to go. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1253.7s)]
*  In the end, President Macron and a special committee agreed to rebuild Notre Dame exactly [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1256.5400000000002s)]
*  as she had been, and with the same materials, stone, wood and lead. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1262.9s)]
*  How is it that the traditionalists won out? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1269.66s)]
*  Well, I think wisdom won. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1272.6200000000001s)]
*  Notre Dame's signature spire was a fairly recent addition. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1277.3s)]
*  Images of the cathedral from the mid-1800s show her without a spire and in an advanced [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1281.66s)]
*  state of decay. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1287.14s)]
*  The cathedral was in great disrepair, was it not? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1288.82s)]
*  It was about to collapse, but of neglect, not of fire. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1292.6999999999998s)]
*  There were even proposals to demolish Notre Dame before the cathedral crumbled on its [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1297.1399999999999s)]
*  own. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1302.1s)]
*  Instead, the French government hired a young architect named Violet Le Duc. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1303.1s)]
*  He created that famous spire. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1308.26s)]
*  So you are rebuilding the spire exactly as Violet Le Duc? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1311.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1315.3s)]
*  Are you using his original drawings? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1316.3s)]
*  We were lucky, he said, because it was extremely well documented. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1320.6599999999999s)]
*  We have the drawings of Violet Le Duc, the sketches, the surveys. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1324.7399999999998s)]
*  We have everything needed to be able to remake it. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1328.8999999999999s)]
*  A thousand French oak trees were felled for the new spire, then fine-cut by carpenters [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1333.86s)]
*  in eastern France. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1341.1399999999999s)]
*  In other workshops around the country, the cathedral's organ, the largest in France, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1342.7399999999998s)]
*  and many of its stained glass windows were restored. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1347.98s)]
*  How many workers and craftsmen do you have on this project? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1351.82s)]
*  If we take into account all the people in France, it's about 1,000 people. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1354.74s)]
*  On the plaza in front of Notre Dame, a huge tent has been erected where stonecutters and [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1362.94s)]
*  sculptors are recreating Gothic gargoyles and adornments damaged in the fire. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1368.38s)]
*  Philippe Villeneuve supervises every detail. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1375.4199999999998s)]
*  I'll make them put their fingers on the layers of the original sculpture, he said, and then [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1382.82s)]
*  on the layer they are sculpting. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1388.4599999999998s)]
*  So he wants you to feel it, not just look at it. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1390.8999999999999s)]
*  And that works? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1395.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1396.86s)]
*  Dani LeBlanc is just 23 years old, sculpting and chiseling to recreate a floral detail [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1399.5s)]
*  carved hundreds of years ago. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1406.5s)]
*  We try to remake things identically, she said, but we are also trying to understand the intention [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1410.5s)]
*  of the original sculptors, so we look at the traces left by their tools. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1416.42s)]
*  We were given rare access to the painstaking restoration of Notre Dame as workers and artisans [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1423.98s)]
*  revived the cathedral's exterior and her interior. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1430.6200000000001s)]
*  The cathedral's great rose windows have been meticulously cleaned and every inch of stone [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1438.46s)]
*  coated with latex, which, when peeled away, leaves the surface gleaming. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1447.82s)]
*  We found restorers, Mathilde Maire and Aude Massimi, working on painted stone sculptures, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1454.9s)]
*  depicting scenes from the life of Christ. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1461.7s)]
*  How old is this? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1464.74s)]
*  This part of the cathedral, she said, was built at the beginning of the 14th century. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1470.26s)]
*  These sculptures are medieval. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1475.38s)]
*  The restorers are carefully wiping every surface with small cotton swabs dipped in a water-based [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1478.78s)]
*  cleaning solution. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1485.06s)]
*  So I think you have to have a lot of patience. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1486.54s)]
*  Yes, we do. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1489.74s)]
*  Yes, she says, you have to be calm and know that it will take time, but it's a pleasure. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1492.02s)]
*  You can see she's wiping away the sentries. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1498.7s)]
*  A 600-ton maze of scaffolding has been built inside Notre Dame to support all the work, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1503.22s)]
*  especially the rebuilding of the spire. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1509.3400000000001s)]
*  General Georges Lannes took us up through it, two-thirds of the way on a construction elevator. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1512.3400000000001s)]
*  We reached the top climbing steps and ladders. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1520.3s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1524.14s)]
*  We were standing 100 feet above the cathedral floor, in exactly the spot where the flaming [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1525.74s)]
*  spire collapsed. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1531.7s)]
*  Four years ago, there was nothing here but a vast hole. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1533.7s)]
*  The drama took place here, and we have to rebuild the vault of the transept. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1537.66s)]
*  The spire will be there, 66 meters high. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1542.9s)]
*  At the top of the old 200-foot spire sat a copper sculpture of a rooster, the symbol [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1548.22s)]
*  of the French people. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1553.8200000000002s)]
*  The day after the fire, Philippe Villeneuve found it on a lower roof, a bit mangled but [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1555.3000000000002s)]
*  miraculously untouched by the flames. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1561.18s)]
*  It has been left as it was found, and will be put on display in the restored cathedral. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1564.3400000000001s)]
*  Can I tell you, Villeneuve says, that I plan to put a new rooster on top of a new spire [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1571.5s)]
*  one year to the day before the reopening of the cathedral? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1576.74s)]
*  There will still be scaffolding, but the frame of the spire will again be in the sky of Paris. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1581.38s)]
*  And the spire will rest on these four pillars you see here. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1588.3s)]
*  You see? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1596.26s)]
*  It will be magnificent. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1597.26s)]
*  Magnificent, yes, for the glory of God and France. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1599.26s)]
*  Next Sunday, the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris will open to the public [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1611.18s)]
*  for the first time since April 2019, when a devastating fire nearly destroyed the Great [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1615.98s)]
*  Gothic Church. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1622.08s)]
*  Two formal Masses will be celebrated, and then as many as 40,000 visitors a day will [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1623.58s)]
*  begin streaming through. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1629.5s)]
*  What they will see is something of a modern miracle. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1631.66s)]
*  Notre Dame has been rebuilt and restored five years after the world watched it burn. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1635.26s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we were given unique access inside the cathedral as workers and artists [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1641.36s)]
*  applied the final touches. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1647.8999999999999s)]
*  Many people deserve credit for the resurrection of Notre Dame, but none more than French President [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1650.4399999999998s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1656.3999999999999s)]
*  You made a promise the day after Notre Dame burned in 2019, and you said, quote, we will [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1659.3799999999999s)]
*  rebuild Notre Dame more beautiful than before, and I want it done in the next five years. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1667.1000000000001s)]
*  Did you have any doubts when you said that that might be possible? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1674.38s)]
*  If you have a doubt, it's already over. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1680.28s)]
*  Someone we spoke to called it a moonshot moment. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1683.1200000000001s)]
*  This five years was a sort of new frontier. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1686.18s)]
*  This is perfectly true. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1688.96s)]
*  When I announced the five years, all the experts, a lot of people just made comments to say [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1690.8799999999999s)]
*  he's crazy. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1696.8999999999999s)]
*  So what gave you the confidence while Notre Dame was still smoking it? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1698.1999999999998s)]
*  I saw these guys, these firemen, I mean, just going beyond their own capacities with such [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1704.0s)]
*  energy and commitment. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1712.36s)]
*  I think this is exactly, this is sort of the metaphor of what our societies and especially [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1714.6599999999999s)]
*  our democracies need. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1721.02s)]
*  Make possible the unthinkable. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1724.76s)]
*  We are all very proud of what we have done together. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1729.1999999999998s)]
*  Last year, President Macron appointed Philippe Jost to lead the team restoring Notre Dame. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1733.74s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we met him just inside what was still an active construction zone. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1739.92s)]
*  What words come to mind when you first walk in? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1746.1200000000001s)]
*  The light is very breathtaking and the space. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1750.3600000000001s)]
*  In this monument, there is a soul. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1756.44s)]
*  And we feel that when we enter now, we feel that. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1761.2s)]
*  To walk into Notre Dame today is to see no sign of 2019. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1767.88s)]
*  Then the cathedral's nave was littered with burnt wood and stone rubble, a gaping hole [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1773.64s)]
*  in the ceiling where the flaming spire crashed through. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1779.6000000000001s)]
*  Even when we visited in 2023, a dense forest of scaffolding remained. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1784.2s)]
*  Now it is open and airy. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1790.1200000000001s)]
*  Every stone shines. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1793.4s)]
*  Every stained glass window is polished. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1795.36s)]
*  Every masterpiece glows, all topped by a new spire and a new roof, replacing the utter [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1798.52s)]
*  destruction of five years ago. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1805.3999999999999s)]
*  We had the big vault there to rebuild. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1808.52s)]
*  So there was a gaping hole? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1813.3999999999999s)]
*  A big hole there. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1815.24s)]
*  When President Macron said five years, we knew that this point here was the most challenging [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1818.96s)]
*  space of the restoration. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1827.96s)]
*  If Philippe Jost is now commander-in-chief of the restoration, Philippe Villeneuve remains [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1830.88s)]
*  its artistic director. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1836.56s)]
*  Chief architect of the cathedral since well before the fire, we saw him in 2023 supervising [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1838.8s)]
*  every detail and every artisan. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1845.62s)]
*  You also told us that rebuilding Notre Dame was in a way rebuilding yourself after the [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1849.1399999999999s)]
*  fire. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1856.8999999999999s)]
*  Do you feel rebuilt now? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1858.1799999999998s)]
*  Yes, Villeneuve told us. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1860.8999999999999s)]
*  Today I can watch images of the fire, see the spire falling into the flames. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1864.2199999999998s)]
*  It's something I couldn't watch before. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1875.42s)]
*  Last year, Villeneuve supervised the construction of a new wooden spire and its lead covering [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1880.02s)]
*  and designed a new rooster, a symbol of the French people, for its very peak. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1885.76s)]
*  It was put in place last December. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1890.68s)]
*  When I saw the spire and the lead roof appear, Villeneuve said, when we put the rooster and [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1897.82s)]
*  the cross in place, I felt that a wound had been closed. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1903.62s)]
*  Since more than eight centuries this cathedral was here. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1909.3s)]
*  It resisted to two world wars, so many battles and campaigns. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1914.4599999999998s)]
*  The decision to rebuild Notre Dame was about our capacity to save, restore, sometimes reinvent [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1918.86s)]
*  what we are by preserving where we come from. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1925.9799999999998s)]
*  This is a message of achievement. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1929.28s)]
*  Many of the achievements, like the new spire and roof, are massive. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1931.78s)]
*  Notre Dame's huge bells were removed after the fire for cleaning and repair, then returned [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1936.26s)]
*  and tested a few weeks ago. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1942.1399999999999s)]
*  Its organ, with 8,000 pipes, the largest in France, was also removed, repaired and reinstalled. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1948.66s)]
*  The day we were there, an organist filled the cathedral with thunderous, soaring sound. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1961.3s)]
*  Somehow small achievements feel just as noteworthy. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1977.18s)]
*  Outside, workmen dangling on ropes to hammer wood into place [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1981.02s)]
*  and carefully cementing paving stones. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1988.86s)]
*  Inside, delicately applying wax to ancient wood, ensuring that every light bulb is lit [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=1992.26s)]
*  and every floor polished. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2000.58s)]
*  Our job is mostly to bring back all the value of mural painting. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2003.26s)]
*  Painting Restorer Diana Castillo has been working in the many small chapels of Notre Dame, where [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2008.82s)]
*  centuries ago murals were painted onto stone walls and ceilings. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2015.02s)]
*  We had a lot of work to clean them. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2020.1s)]
*  Diana shared photos and video of what the chapels and paintings looked like when she [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2023.5s)]
*  and other restorers began their work after the fire, cloudy and dim, and their appearance [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2028.96s)]
*  now after cleaning. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2035.92s)]
*  So we did one chapel after another, after another, and after we finished the cleaning [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2039.08s)]
*  process. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2044.28s)]
*  It was really almost one year. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2048.96s)]
*  We were like, okay, now we can see the paint, now we can appreciate it and start the restoration. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2050.7599999999998s)]
*  So you were not just removing the soot from the fire, but you were removing the grime [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2058.72s)]
*  from centuries. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2064.2s)]
*  Exactly, exactly, exactly. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2065.2s)]
*  1850, actually, many of them had never been touched since 1850, so you imagine 170 years. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2067.3199999999997s)]
*  Today the murals are gleaming. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2074.8799999999997s)]
*  Ceilings show starry nights of deep blue and gold, and stone columns that had been gray [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2078.02s)]
*  are now kaleidoscopes of color. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2084.2s)]
*  And you have brought those colors back to life. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2087.3199999999997s)]
*  Absolutely, yes, and I'm sure many people will be shocked. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2089.6s)]
*  And the result like this is very satisfying for us, of course. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2093.22s)]
*  Similar transformations are everywhere in the new Notre Dame. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2097.04s)]
*  Stone walls and ceilings that had been dark and gloomy seem to shine, and so do the many [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2101.44s)]
*  marble statues and decorative metalworks. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2107.32s)]
*  The workers and craftspeople who have pulled all this off are known as companions, and [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2110.74s)]
*  their work is celebrated on huge banners overlooking the River Seine. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2116.4s)]
*  We've heard of something called the Notre Dame effect, which is young people being drawn [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2121.36s)]
*  to traditional crafts and trades because of the work they're doing and seeing being done [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2127.6400000000003s)]
*  here at the cathedral. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2134.96s)]
*  Have you witnessed that? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2136.92s)]
*  It's true, Philippe Villeneuve told us, that Notre Dame was a formidable school for all [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2138.6800000000003s)]
*  the different crafts, carpenters, metalworkers, stone carvers, painters. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2149.2s)]
*  All these kinds of jobs were boosted by the restoration. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2154.72s)]
*  I visited the site a few times, and each time what's dropping the most was the commitment [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2158.64s)]
*  and the joy and the responsibility of the companions that I met. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2164.62s)]
*  Anne-Diess Griffin was born in France and educated in the U.S., where she runs an investment [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2168.8399999999997s)]
*  firm. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2174.7599999999998s)]
*  She has helped mobilize financial support in America to revitalize Notre Dame. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2175.76s)]
*  Why do you think this symbol of Paris and of France inspires such strong feelings, not [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2181.76s)]
*  just here, but in the U.S. and around the world? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2189.5600000000004s)]
*  Notre Dame symbolizes something universal, and that's something to be cherished. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2194.44s)]
*  Anne's contribution to the restoration effort was one of the largest from anyone in the [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2200.32s)]
*  The support from Americans was just tremendous. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2205.96s)]
*  There were over 45,000 donors who contributed funds to the cathedral for a sum of over $57 [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2209.2000000000003s)]
*  million. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2217.36s)]
*  So we should be incredibly proud of that. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2218.36s)]
*  Every penny of that has been needed. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2221.08s)]
*  The total cost of restoring Notre Dame is nearing a billion dollars, including, Philippe [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2223.4s)]
*  Jost told us, for measures to prevent another tragedy. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2229.4s)]
*  So you have new fire detection, new fire suppression systems that have all been installed? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2233.82s)]
*  Installed in the roof. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2241.5800000000004s)]
*  So that would prevent another catastrophe like this from ever happening again? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2245.38s)]
*  We are very confident in that. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2252.1800000000003s)]
*  It will not happen again. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2254.1000000000004s)]
*  Jost also expressed confidence that rebuilding the new Notre Dame, using the old materials [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2255.98s)]
*  of wood and stone and lead, will help it to last. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2262.44s)]
*  The cathedral is 860 years old, and we will restore it for 860 years. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2266.96s)]
*  That it will last another 860 years. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2276.56s)]
*  And perhaps more. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2280.92s)]
*  Architect Philippe Villeneuve championed the use of traditional materials, especially to [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2283.28s)]
*  new spire, just as the old one had been constructed. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2288.66s)]
*  But he let us in on a secret. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2293.06s)]
*  There is one new touch up there. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2295.46s)]
*  I left a small mark of myself, he told us. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2303.46s)]
*  In one of the hooks of the new spire is my face, with an admiring and affectionate look [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2306.96s)]
*  to represent all the companions who rebuilt the cathedral. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2312.7999999999997s)]
*  President Macron visited Notre Dame while we were there, when it was still buzzing with [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2320.3999999999996s)]
*  preparations for opening day. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2325.2799999999997s)]
*  It's impressive and very moving to see that we still have dozens of people working hard, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2327.9599999999996s)]
*  if you need a job. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2336.04s)]
*  And as Notre Dame's great doors reopen, might that spirit be even a little bit contagious? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2338.88s)]
*  There's a lot of political division here in France, as there is in the United States. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2346.56s)]
*  So in this climate, how important is it to have a project like this that unifies rather [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2351.46s)]
*  than divides? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2360.86s)]
*  We speak about moment of unity and pride. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2362.26s)]
*  This is exactly what our nations need, especially in that time. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2365.44s)]
*  We should try to consider this type of moment and great projects and think, if we're already [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2370.8s)]
*  unable to do so, why don't we try to fix other, perhaps more abstract, but very important [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2376.48s)]
*  big issues of our countries. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2384.84s)]
*  So the impossible is not impossible? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2386.88s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2389.0800000000004s)]
*  It's French motto. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2390.0800000000004s)]
*  Impossible is not French. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2392.6800000000003s)]
*  With a grueling pandemic and gruesome political season, you'd be forgiven for giving up [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2395.32s)]
*  on the idea of miracles. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2408.2000000000003s)]
*  But tonight, we will take you to a place that's known for them. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2410.6400000000003s)]
*  The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in southern France is the site of 70 medical miracles [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2414.48s)]
*  recognized by the Catholic Church. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2420.1200000000003s)]
*  The Marian Shrine is famous to the faithful, but less well known is the Lord's Office [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2422.86s)]
*  of Medical Observations. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2428.1s)]
*  That's where world-renowned doctors and researchers conduct decade-long investigations into the [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2429.7400000000002s)]
*  countless claims of cures reported over the years. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2435.98s)]
*  They determine which cases can be medically explained and which cannot. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2440.04s)]
*  It's those Church officials might call a miracle. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2444.26s)]
*  For the doctors, it's a lesson in the limits of medicine. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2448.62s)]
*  For the devout, it's divine intervention. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2452.04s)]
*  The small French town of Lourdes, tucked in the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains, draws [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2458.7s)]
*  more than three million pilgrims every year, more than travel to Mecca or Jerusalem. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2464.66s)]
*  And almost everyone you meet will tell you they've heard stories of miracles here. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2471.66s)]
*  We heard none more inspiring than that of Sister Bernadette Moriot. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2477.7799999999997s)]
*  I really tried everything I could, but this is something that cannot be healed. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2484.54s)]
*  What was your prognosis? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2490.8599999999997s)]
*  Full total paralysis. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2493.7s)]
*  The prognosis was really dark. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2495.58s)]
*  Strolling with 83-year-old Sister Moriot through the chapel grounds in Brel, France, we found [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2498.98s)]
*  it hard to believe that for half her life she suffered from cauda equina, a disorder [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2505.7s)]
*  of the nerves and lower spine. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2511.2799999999997s)]
*  You wore this all the time. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2513.48s)]
*  Her left foot, she said, was twisted and limp. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2515.02s)]
*  To walk at all, she needed this back and leg brace, an implant to dull nerve pain and massive [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2519.16s)]
*  doses of morphine. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2525.96s)]
*  She told us she had exhausted all treatment options. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2528.8799999999997s)]
*  So in 2008, her doctor convinced her to make a pilgrimage to Lourdes. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2532.42s)]
*  You believe in miracles at the time? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2538.2200000000003s)]
*  I always believed in miracles, but not for me. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2540.38s)]
*  So why did you decide to go? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2543.3s)]
*  Well I didn't go there for a miracle, I just went there to pray with others. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2546.66s)]
*  Lourdes is a place where the smallest people, all the sickest, all the poorest, they come [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2550.62s)]
*  first. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2555.5s)]
*  The sickest, the poorest, the diseased and debilitated, bearing wounds visible and hidden, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2556.58s)]
*  come from all over the world, seeking to be healed by the shrine's natural spring waters [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2568.02s)]
*  and the power of prayer. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2573.78s)]
*  And so I've asked for complete healing or a super long remission. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2577.1s)]
*  This was Kim Halpin's first pilgrimage. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2584.1800000000003s)]
*  She found out last year she has incurable blood cancer and came all the way from Kansas [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2587.04s)]
*  to cleanse herself in the waters of Lourdes. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2592.88s)]
*  Are you expecting to be healed? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2596.48s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2599.84s)]
*  Ask for as much as I want and maybe I will be blessed with part of it, which will be [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2601.76s)]
*  okay. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2606.56s)]
*  Halpin was aided by her son Sean. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2608.8s)]
*  He couldn't help but notice there are as many volunteers as sick here. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2611.44s)]
*  The Our Lady of Lourdes Hospitality North American Volunteers helped Jamie Jensen travel [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2616.7200000000003s)]
*  from Minnesota for his 18th visit. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2622.84s)]
*  Even though the camera sees that I have a condition and a chair, when I'm here, I don't [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2626.44s)]
*  have a condition. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2637.16s)]
*  Sean's condition is cerebral palsy. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2639.36s)]
*  All those trips to Lourdes haven't given him the physical miracle he wanted, but maybe, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2642.2400000000002s)]
*  he says, he got the miracle he needed. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2647.6s)]
*  I was very bitter, very angry with myself. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2651.6800000000003s)]
*  Did coming to Lourdes change your heart? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2656.4s)]
*  Very much. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2660.44s)]
*  Do you consider that a miracle? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2661.9s)]
*  I do because there's a peace within myself. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2663.96s)]
*  Stories of inner peace and acceptance don't meet the bar for the Office of Medical Observations, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2674.2400000000002s)]
*  and with just 70 medical miracles recognized in 160 years, you'd have better odds playing [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2680.08s)]
*  the lotto. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2686.64s)]
*  Yet thousands of faithful line up at the baths and at this grotto where the first miracle [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2688.2s)]
*  is said to have occurred. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2694.16s)]
*  The sanctuary, with its three basilicas and 25 chapels, is laid out like a grand theater [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2697.7599999999998s)]
*  complex, its many stages offering dozens of pious performances throughout the day. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2704.12s)]
*  The finale, a candlelit procession every night. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2713.44s)]
*  There would be none of this were it not for St. Bernadette. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2723.04s)]
*  According to Catholic lore, in 1858, a mysterious woman appeared in this grotto to Bernadette [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2727.12s)]
*  Subaru, a 14-year-old peasant girl. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2734.44s)]
*  Jean-Marc Mica, the bishop of Lourdes, says the woman spoke with Subaru several times [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2738.16s)]
*  over five months. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2744.68s)]
*  And once, the 25th of March, day of the Annunciation, she said, I am the Immaculate Conception. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2746.64s)]
*  When word got out the Immaculate Conception, the Virgin Mary, had appeared in Lourdes, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2758.3199999999997s)]
*  people flocked to this grotto and within days started making claims of miracle cures, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2764.28s)]
*  the ability to walk, restored sight. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2770.4s)]
*  Worried about fueling mass hysteria, the church set up the Office of Medical Observations [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2774.0400000000004s)]
*  in 1883 to investigate the claims. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2779.0800000000004s)]
*  Which brings us back to the other Bernadette in our story. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2783.36s)]
*  Fourteen years ago, Sister Morio found herself in a wheelchair in a procession at Lourdes [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2787.52s)]
*  seeking the intervention of St. Bernadette. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2793.84s)]
*  And I really had that feeling that the Lord was walking with us. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2797.28s)]
*  And I heard him giving me these words, I see your suffering and that of your sick brothers [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2801.0s)]
*  and sisters. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2805.84s)]
*  Just give me everything. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2807.2s)]
*  You heard the voice of Jesus. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2808.4s)]
*  Yes, I heard this inner voice. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2810.96s)]
*  I can't really tell you whose voice it was. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2814.2s)]
*  It was like a spiritual experience. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2816.52s)]
*  She said she returned home rejuvenated spiritually, but physically she felt worse. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2819.68s)]
*  After three days in excruciating pain, she told us she suddenly found the strength to [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2826.12s)]
*  walk to the chapel and pray. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2831.96s)]
*  Then I felt some kind of heat coming into my body. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2835.12s)]
*  I felt relaxed, but I didn't really know what that was meaning. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2838.4s)]
*  And in my room, I heard this inner voice again telling me, take all your braces off. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2842.82s)]
*  I didn't think twice and I started taking my foot brace off. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2848.1800000000003s)]
*  And my foot, that used to be crooked, was straight and I could actually put it on the [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2852.1000000000004s)]
*  ground without feeling any pain. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2856.54s)]
*  All of a sudden your foot was straight? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2858.94s)]
*  Yes, like that. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2860.94s)]
*  Like the way it is just now. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2862.52s)]
*  And so I kept going. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2864.48s)]
*  She says she took off the braces and stopped the morphine all at once. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2866.26s)]
*  Did this make sense to you? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2871.42s)]
*  No, I knew it was impossible. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2873.5s)]
*  She came to my door with her doctor and she said, last year I came to Lourdes on pilgrimage [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2876.86s)]
*  and three days after I got back home, I was cured. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2882.58s)]
*  Dr. Alessandro DeFrancicis hears stories like that all the time. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2885.82s)]
*  As the president and residing physician at the Lord's Office of Medical Observations, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2890.92s)]
*  the former pediatrician's job is to determine whether there is more to those stories by [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2895.82s)]
*  applying seven strict criteria established by the church. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2901.02s)]
*  And we're looking for a diagnosis. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2905.54s)]
*  And if that diagnosis is a diagnosis of a severe disease with a severe prognosis, and [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2908.46s)]
*  then we want to make sure that that person is a person that was cured in a way that one [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2914.1s)]
*  would say suddenly, in an instantaneous way, in a complete way, in a way lasting in time. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2919.74s)]
*  My seventh criteria that has to match is there must be no possible explanation to that cure. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2927.2999999999997s)]
*  Sister Benedetta Morio. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2934.42s)]
*  He showed us the archives, which hold thousands of recorded claims of cures. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2936.9s)]
*  This feels like it's almost ten pounds. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2942.14s)]
*  Ten pounds. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2943.8199999999997s)]
*  Dr. DeFrancicis, a practicing Catholic, told us what separates the more than 7,000 claims [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2944.8199999999997s)]
*  of cures from the 70 the church calls miracles is an ungodly amount of medical documentation [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2951.82s)]
*  and patients like Sister Morio willing to put their lives under a microscope. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2958.18s)]
*  We sent her to two different neurologists. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2964.5s)]
*  We sent her to different rheumatologists because of the different specific case of her disease. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2966.9s)]
*  We asked to repeat twice all sorts of imagery, electrophysiology. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2972.58s)]
*  We did all that we would do in medicine to be absolutely sure of her diagnosis. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2978.0s)]
*  And it was. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2981.44s)]
*  But he wanted to confirm something else. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2982.8s)]
*  I was asked to meet with two psychiatrists in Paris. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2986.92s)]
*  They wanted to know if I was lying, if I had already had any hallucinations, if I had levitated. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=2992.56s)]
*  I remember answering, no, doctor, I never left the ground floor. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3001.48s)]
*  Satisfied, Dr. DeFrancicis sent Sister Morio's case to a group of 33 doctors and professors [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3006.8799999999997s)]
*  called the International Medical Committee of Lords. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3014.44s)]
*  Its job is to determine whether a cure is what they consider medically unexplained. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3018.16s)]
*  We're not trying to reel something in or reel something out. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3024.3999999999996s)]
*  We're just trying to be objective. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3026.7599999999998s)]
*  You could call them the devil's advocates. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3028.24s)]
*  Dr. Michael Moran, a surgical oncologist, Dr. Jacek Mostwin, a professor of urology [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3031.2000000000003s)]
*  at Johns Hopkins, and Dr. Kieran Moriarty, a renowned addiction specialist, scrutinized [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3037.6800000000003s)]
*  Sister Morio's case. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3044.2000000000003s)]
*  Is there anything that could have caused her response? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3046.44s)]
*  No treatment would be that effective that quickly. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3054.76s)]
*  Does religion enter into your medical conversation? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3059.3199999999997s)]
*  We cannot separate ourselves as people who have been deeply immersed in the culture and [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3062.92s)]
*  the traditions of lords in the church. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3068.56s)]
*  But make no mistake, we're just as technical as a forensic pathologist when it comes to [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3070.92s)]
*  looking at the technical details of the case. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3075.5s)]
*  After eight years of investigation, the committee determined that Sister Morio's case was medically [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3078.36s)]
*  unexplained. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3084.14s)]
*  So when you do a survey, the investigation of Sister Bernadette's or any of the other [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3086.0s)]
*  cures, this is done on a purely medical basis, something that could be peer-reviewed by other [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3091.32s)]
*  physicians outside of… [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3099.6s)]
*  Not could, that is. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz9ruRSmFQA&t=3100.6s)]
