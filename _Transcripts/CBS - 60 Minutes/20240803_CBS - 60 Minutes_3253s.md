# Wrongful detainees, exiled Putin dissidents, dirty Russian cash & Russian sanctions | Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [August 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U)
*  When most of us hear the word hostage, we think of someone held captive by a terrorist [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=0.0s)]
*  group or criminal gang seeking ransom, attention, or worse. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=17.52s)]
*  But the vast majority of Americans imprisoned abroad today are held not by terrorist groups, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  but by foreign governments with whom the U.S. has thorny or in some cases no relations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=29.72s)]
*  Our government calls them wrongful detainees, and there are currently more than 40 of them. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=36.12s)]
*  This fall saw a rare moment of success, the release of a 37-year-old journalist named [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=42.72s)]
*  Danny Fenster, a Detroit native who'd been locked away for nearly six months in a small, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=48.64s)]
*  always-lit cell in a prison in Myanmar, formerly called Burma. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=55.68s)]
*  Danny Fenster's reunion with his family in November is the moment every hostage and detainee [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=62.8s)]
*  family dreams of. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=69.56s)]
*  Danny Fenster had moved to Myanmar in 2019 and worked as an editor for several publications. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=74.56s)]
*  He and his wife, a Brazilian diplomat named Juliana, watched in dismay as a year ago [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=81.92s)]
*  this month a military junta ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, which brought [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=88.52s)]
*  throngs of peaceful protesters into the streets. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=94.92s)]
*  Within weeks, though, the military regime ordered a violent crackdown that drew worldwide [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=98.36s)]
*  condemnation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=105.6s)]
*  Right last spring, Danny had a flight home to visit his parents, but as he was about [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=108.02s)]
*  to board the plane, a group of policemen showed up and called out his name. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=112.89999999999999s)]
*  And I just looked up like, what? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  And I said, yeah, that's me. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=119.74s)]
*  And they said, we have questions for a criminal investigation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=121.66s)]
*  Did they allow you to make any phone calls? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=127.66s)]
*  No. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=128.66s)]
*  I got a couple text messages off to Juliana saying, call the American embassy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=129.66s)]
*  I am being detained. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=133.98s)]
*  Were you handcuffed? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=135.62s)]
*  I was handcuffed and blindfolded. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=137.26s)]
*  I had a very long text message from his wife, Juliana. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=139.1s)]
*  Brian Fenster, Danny's older brother, back home in Detroit, was the first in the family [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=144.06s)]
*  to learn that Danny was in prison and the family immediately mobilized. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=149.26s)]
*  Please, I beg you, we beg you, bring Danny home. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=154.7s)]
*  They launched a Bring Danny Home campaign, including supporters worldwide sketching his [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  picture. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  Danny was eventually charged with incitement and wrongful association based on his work [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=165.78s)]
*  for a banned publication that had been critical of the military, even though he hadn't worked [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=171.18s)]
*  there for 10 months. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  He says he desperately wanted to let his family know he wasn't being tortured. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=178.82000000000002s)]
*  But for weeks, he wasn't allowed any communication at all outside the prison. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=183.8s)]
*  I remember just staring at the wall thinking, sort of figuratively, you know, I just, when [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=188.98000000000002s)]
*  is that tank going to bust through the wall, you know, and get me out of here? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=194.1s)]
*  You really thought at one point you were going to be rescued? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=197.7s)]
*  No, but I was really hoping. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=201.66s)]
*  Release Danny immediately. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=204.54s)]
*  The State Department made repeated appeals. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=206.42s)]
*  We remain deeply concerned over the continued detention of Danny Fenster. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=209.26s)]
*  But the U.S. government hasn't recognized the legitimacy of the junta. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=213.45999999999998s)]
*  So even getting information about Danny was difficult. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=217.85999999999999s)]
*  After a month, he was finally allowed periodic phone calls with his family. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=221.7s)]
*  It was hard. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=226.7s)]
*  I mean, there were many calls we had with him where he was in tears. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=227.7s)]
*  You're trying to find the words for him. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=231.42s)]
*  You know, after one month, two months, three months, four months. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=233.54s)]
*  Back in Washington, Danny's case had fallen under the mandate of Roger Carstens, one of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=237.7s)]
*  the few State Department officials held over from the Trump administration. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=242.89999999999998s)]
*  He's a man with a tough job and an odd sounding title. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=247.66s)]
*  You're called SPIHA. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=251.9s)]
*  What does that mean, SPIHA? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=254.18s)]
*  It's Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=256.21999999999997s)]
*  So everyone truncates it into SPIHA. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=259.42s)]
*  The SPIHA office was created in 2015 after an internal review of U.S. hostage policy [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=261.94s)]
*  following the tragic deaths of American journalists and aid workers held captive by ISIS and complaints [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=269.82s)]
*  from hostage families that the government hadn't been proactive enough. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=277.46s)]
*  But in the years since, the makeup of Roger Carsten's cases has changed. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=281.85999999999996s)]
*  I'm kind of surprised that there are many more, many more hostages being held by governments [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=287.46s)]
*  than by terrorists. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=294.9s)]
*  I know that is surprising, isn't it? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=295.9s)]
*  The majority of our cases are actually what we call wrongful detentions. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=298.29999999999995s)]
*  It's when a nation state actually is detaining Americans essentially unjustly. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=302.4s)]
*  That government wants something in return for our citizens. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=306.82s)]
*  They want to use that person for political leverage. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=310.96s)]
*  They want to use them as a bargaining chip. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=313.48s)]
*  It's something that people don't know about, they don't think about very much. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=315.9s)]
*  Washington Post reporter and Iranian-American Jason Rezaian was a wrongful detainee himself, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=321.18s)]
*  imprisoned for a year and a half in Iran, where he'd been living as the paper's bureau chief. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=328.26s)]
*  He was freed as part of a prisoner swap in 2016 and has been pushing ever since for the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=334.42s)]
*  U.S. government to prioritize the cases of the more than 40 current wrongful detainees. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=341.78000000000003s)]
*  We're not doing enough for these people and we're not doing it quickly enough. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=348.38s)]
*  What countries around the world are holding Americans right now? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=351.90000000000003s)]
*  Iran, which is sort of the perennial hostage taker. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=356.42s)]
*  China, who has more than anybody else. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=359.74s)]
*  Russia, Venezuela. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=362.42s)]
*  Does our government have a stern policy against quid pro quos? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=364.98s)]
*  That's a hard question to answer and here's why. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=369.86s)]
*  There are things that to give in would actually either provide an incentive or a benefit to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=372.1s)]
*  the hostage taker. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=376.98s)]
*  And so my job is to start becoming creative. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=378.26s)]
*  What else can we possibly do to solve this problem without giving a direct concession? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=381.22s)]
*  Prisoner swaps, taking the innocent American and swapping him for a guilty criminal. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=386.5s)]
*  We've done that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=393.62s)]
*  There's a way I can get someone out that doesn't involve a swap much better. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=394.90000000000003s)]
*  But in Danny Fenster's case, the Myanmar government wasn't asking for any policy concessions or [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=398.94s)]
*  prisoner swaps. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=404.66s)]
*  It did look like he was going to get out. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=406.16s)]
*  Enter former congressman, U.N. ambassador and New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=408.46000000000004s)]
*  established a foundation that facilitates the delivery of humanitarian aid and engages [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=413.9s)]
*  in hostage negotiating, his long time, sometimes controversial specialty. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=420.06s)]
*  How are you feeling? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=425.34s)]
*  He had a long history with Myanmar and was concerned about a local former employee of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=426.62s)]
*  his foundation who had also been arrested. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=432.38s)]
*  He secured an invitation from the military regime to come to discuss humanitarian assistance [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=435.58s)]
*  and COVID vaccines and told the State Department he wanted to work on the Fenster case too, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=442.06s)]
*  but he got pushback. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=448.22s)]
*  They asked me not to raise Danny Fenster. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=450.14s)]
*  Did you say why shouldn't I raise him? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=453.1s)]
*  Yeah, I said, look, this is what I do. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=455.02s)]
*  So I said, all right, look, I'm going to go. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=458.06s)]
*  There was some tension between Governor Richardson and the State Department. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=461.18s)]
*  The bottom line is that I had discussions on a few occasions where I said, we have a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=465.98s)]
*  current line of effort. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=470.54s)]
*  I'm feeling pretty good about this. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=472.38s)]
*  Can we hold off a little bit? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=473.66s)]
*  Richardson held off briefly, but then flew to Myanmar this past November and participated [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=475.90000000000003s)]
*  in two days of humanitarian aid meetings at the presidential palace with the isolated military [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=482.38s)]
*  regime, including the commander in chief, a man considered responsible at the time for more than [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=489.42s)]
*  1200 civilian deaths. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=496.46000000000004s)]
*  It was a PR coup for the junta, which splashed photos of the meeting far and wide. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=499.02s)]
*  When I think we convinced them of our sincerity, then I said, by the way, you've got, I want two [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=505.41999999999996s)]
*  things. You have an activist Burmese woman that worked for me. I want you to release her. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=512.86s)]
*  The next day she'd been released. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=519.5s)]
*  Just like that? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=521.5799999999999s)]
*  Just like that. Then I decided I'm on a roll. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=522.46s)]
*  By the way, there's an American journalist named Danny Finster, and you should release it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=526.5400000000001s)]
*  It'd be the right thing. The American people are going to like this. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=534.46s)]
*  Your record with the U.S. government right now is not very good, so it makes you look good. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=537.98s)]
*  Humanitarian gesture. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=544.5400000000001s)]
*  But you were defying the State Department. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=546.22s)]
*  I wasn't defying. I just saw an opportunity, and I took it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=549.0200000000001s)]
*  Richardson says the commander privately told him he'd release Finster, but not yet. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=553.9799999999999s)]
*  So he left Myanmar empty-handed, slammed for having given a pariah regime legitimacy, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=560.06s)]
*  and looking like he might have made things worse for Danny Finster, who was sentenced a week later. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=566.86s)]
*  You've been convicted on every count and sentenced to 11 years. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=573.0999999999999s)]
*  11 years? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=577.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. It was like despair, you know? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=578.06s)]
*  Yeah. Helpless. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=581.9s)]
*  Yeah, helpless. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=583.74s)]
*  There was criticism. There was a feeling that you would botch this meeting, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=585.1s)]
*  and it led to Danny Finster getting this 11-year sentence. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=589.74s)]
*  You know, families get so emotional. They go through ups and downs. But I knew if the commander [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=593.9s)]
*  kept his word, and I thought he would, that this would be forgotten. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=601.5s)]
*  Go away. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=606.54s)]
*  And I got him out. He's out. And we did it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=607.42s)]
*  Sure enough, just days after the sentencing, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=611.42s)]
*  Richardson was quietly summoned back to Myanmar. And Danny was unexpectedly taken out of his cell, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=614.62s)]
*  put in a van, and without knowing where he was going, driven to the airport. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=621.9s)]
*  I just see a bunch of white guys in suits. I didn't know who was who. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=628.14s)]
*  And there was Danny, walking towards me. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=631.8199999999999s)]
*  And he said, I'm here to take you home. I just couldn't stop smiling. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=636.62s)]
*  I was smiling so much. I was so happy. The sun was on my face. I could feel the sun. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=640.62s)]
*  Yeah, it was amazing. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=646.38s)]
*  I'd like to start with saying thank you to Governor Richardson for securing the release [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=647.98s)]
*  of Danny Finster. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=651.5799999999999s)]
*  If there was any lingering anger over Governor Richardson's trip, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=652.4599999999999s)]
*  it was not on display at the press conference when Danny landed on U.S. soil. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=656.4599999999999s)]
*  I just can't get upset when the governor actually brings him home. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=662.14s)]
*  We have no pride of authorship. Whoever can come up with a plan and get someone out, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=666.06s)]
*  we're down for the win. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=670.46s)]
*  JANE FERGUSON, Former U.S. Attorney General, Venezuela, United States Department of Justice [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=671.34s)]
*  Carson says he's hopeful about some of the other detainee cases. Recently, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=671.98s)]
*  he traveled to Venezuela to meet nine Americans imprisoned there, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=677.34s)]
*  and in ongoing negotiations to revive the Iran nuclear deal. The U.S. envoy has said, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=682.22s)]
*  it would be very hard for us to imagine getting back into the nuclear deal while four innocent [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=689.18s)]
*  Americans are being held hostage. Yet Jason Rezayan says it's still not enough. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=695.7399999999999s)]
*  When you say we should prioritize getting these people out, the implication is that you're saying, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=702.4599999999999s)]
*  let's make a deal, let's do a swap, and then you're right back to the issue of incentivizing this [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=708.9399999999999s)]
*  Look, ultimately, when Americans come home, when Brits come home, when French people come home, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=715.98s)]
*  there are some concessions. The issue is not whether or not to give a concession. The issue is, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=720.38s)]
*  how do we make it difficult on the back end? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=726.14s)]
*  So you're saying, make the deal here and then punish them later. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=727.98s)]
*  Bring them home, however you need to do it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=731.5s)]
*  Money, swaps, whatever. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=734.7s)]
*  You know what? Cut through all the BS and just bring people home. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=737.02s)]
*  Critics say that even though you work very hard, you keep the families apprised of what's going on, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=740.38s)]
*  that you're not doing a good job. There are still 40 people being held. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=747.6600000000001s)]
*  When I go to bed every night, I feel the weight of not having brought home between 40 and 50 [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=751.9000000000001s)]
*  Americans. So I don't go to bed usually feeling good. I usually wake up with energy. Can't wait [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=756.7s)]
*  to get to the office and get back after it. But this is a business of ones and zeros in [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=762.86s)]
*  computer language. Someone comes home, steps on a tarmac in America, falls into the arms of [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=767.1s)]
*  their loved ones. You've got a victory there. But unless that's happening, you're losing. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=772.22s)]
*  We want to leave you [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=779.82s)]

*  71-year-old Vladimir Putin has now led Russia for 24 years. If he serves out the presidential [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=811.74s)]

*  Putin's challengers often meet untimely ends. One after an explosion on a plane and Alexei Navalny, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=826.3s)]
*  Putin's leading rival who died in February in an Arctic prison camp. Putin has also killed nearly [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=835.02s)]
*  all internal opposition to his unprovoked war in Ukraine. And yet, many courageous Russians [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=842.78s)]
*  continue the struggle outside the country. As we first reported in March, we met some of them [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=850.6999999999999s)]
*  in a city that you might think of as the capital of free Russia. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=857.3399999999999s)]
*  It's 500 miles west of Moscow, the city of Vilnius in Lithuania, where there's no love lost for Russia. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=863.66s)]
*  Lithuania is a democracy of about three million people and a NATO ally. Vilnius, the capital, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=873.18s)]
*  is clothed in the colors of Ukraine. The city changed the Russian embassy's address to [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=880.6999999999999s)]

*  with his arrest warrant. Since Putin's 2022 invasion, Lithuania has welcomed more than [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=895.42s)]
*  2,500 Russian exiles. It is our policy to provide shelter to all freedom fighters. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=903.18s)]

*  I haven't seen so many Ukrainian flags since I was in Kyiv. Why do your people feel so strongly [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=920.14s)]
*  about this? Our freedom, our independence, our sort of security is being defended in the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=928.54s)]
*  battlefields in Ukraine. Ukrainians are dying so that we can be safe. There are many more Russian [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=935.5s)]
*  dissidents who would like to come to Lithuania. Can you accept any more? Yes, I think we can accept. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=941.5799999999999s)]
*  Of course, we will accommodate as many as needed and provide them with the possibility to work [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=948.9399999999999s)]

*  freedom and democracy is a crusading mom. Two years ago, Anastasia Shevchenko fled Putin's regime. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=962.14s)]
*  This is a terrorist regime. They are threatening other countries with oil, gas, nuclear weapon, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=971.02s)]
*  and grain. They are threatening us with our children, with our parents, with our lives, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=977.34s)]
*  and so on. More than anything, it was her daughter Alina, severely disabled at birth, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=982.86s)]
*  that made Shevchenko an activist against Putin. Back then, the family was in southern Russia [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=990.14s)]
*  and Alina was in a Russian government nursing home. Alina could not speak, could not communicate. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=997.1s)]
*  No. She was like a one-week child, like a baby. She was 17, but even to feed her, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1004.3s)]
*  it was a whole science because she needed blended food. You need to hold her in a special position. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1016.8599999999999s)]
*  Shevchenko cared for Alina much of the time because the Russian nursing facility [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1023.9799999999999s)]
*  was short on staff and supplies. I was struggling to get medication for my [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1029.5s)]
*  daughter. Begging in the pharmacy, she needed it. It was very important for her health. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1036.14s)]
*  They said, no, we just don't have it because the ministry forgot to order it this month, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1045.02s)]
*  and you need to wait. I decided I'm not going to keep silence and I'm going to stand out and to [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1051.34s)]
*  speak out. She spoke out through a Russian democracy group called Open Russia. It was [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1059.02s)]
*  tolerated 10 years ago and Shevchenko organized protests in her hometown. But in 2019, the Kremlin [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1066.1399999999999s)]
*  cracked down. Shevchenko was arrested and her lawyer warned her she would be shocked [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1074.7s)]
*  by what the police had already done. He showed me the screenshots of me in my bed, and I realized [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1081.5s)]
*  that they had installed the video camera into the air conditioning unit above my bed, and they have [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1091.18s)]
*  been watching me for six months in my bedroom. A Russian court ordered Shevchenko into house arrest. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1098.46s)]
*  She couldn't visit or care for Alina. It wasn't long before her daughter developed pneumonia. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1105.98s)]
*  By the time a judge granted Shevchenko a pass to the hospital, Alina was unconscious. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1112.7800000000002s)]
*  I spent maybe 10 minutes holding her hand because that's what I do when my children are ill. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1119.5800000000002s)]
*  When you hold their hand, they feel better. But this time, she was cold. She didn't feel me, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1126.22s)]
*  and she died in an hour. In 2021, Shevchenko was given a four-year suspended sentence. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1134.3s)]
*  But when Putin invaded Ukraine the next year, she decided to flee Russia. From her southern city, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1143.5s)]
*  she took her two surviving children on an 1,100-mile drive. A U.S.-based democracy group [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1151.1s)]
*  arranged Lithuanian visas. What does this tell us about Russia today? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1159.18s)]
*  It's enough to write something on social media. Just one sentence, and you can be imprisoned for [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1165.1000000000001s)]
*  years. They are listening to your phone calls. They are watching you in your bedroom. They are [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1172.22s)]
*  controlling you. Breaking that control is why Sergei Davidis also left Russia for Lithuania [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1178.46s)]
*  in 2022. You would be in a Russian prison just for doing this interview? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1186.54s)]
*  In Moscow, Davidis helped lead one of Russia's largest human rights groups, called Memorial. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1195.42s)]
*  It won the Nobel Peace Prize two years ago, but now it's banned. He told us, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1202.46s)]
*  As almost every day, there are more and more arrests. We hear news about new political arrests. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1208.14s)]
*  And apart from the legal side of it, more often than before, there's violence and torture. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1217.18s)]

*  Well, I'm afraid I can't release that information in more detail, but let's put it this way, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1469.1s)]
*  that Russia is constantly probing and constantly trying. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1474.14s)]
*  And this past March, Russia may have gotten through. Leonid Volkov was attacked with a [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1481.1000000000001s)]

*  I can only explain it this way. In 2003, Khodorkovsky, an oil titan, dared to publicly [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=1906.86s)]

*  we can't do that because Putin might retaliate. That appeasement is exactly the tactic the West [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2336.54s)]

*  always had two different tracks of effort deterrence and imposing costs as well as diplomacy. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2795.66s)]
*  That's still our strategy. One official directly involved told us there was a back and forth between [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2801.66s)]
*  Americans and financial technocrats inside Russia but that line of communication mysteriously went [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2807.58s)]
*  silent two days after the war started. Look we can't get into Putin's mind. He's a brutal tyrant. All [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2814.46s)]
*  we can control, all we can ensure is that this will be a strategic failure for Putin. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2821.26s)]
*  What does a strategic failure look like today? It means his ability to project power and exert [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2827.1000000000004s)]
*  influence are fundamentally downgraded. Power is not the exercise of brute force. Of land grabs. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2832.86s)]
*  To acquire land. That's not what it's all about. In this century our view is power is much more [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2840.0600000000004s)]
*  closely tied to your economic strength, your technological sophistication and your story. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2845.82s)]
*  Can you attract ideas and talent and goodwill? What targets are left? We can broaden our sanctions. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2850.78s)]
*  So take the measures, take the sanctions we've already applied, apply them to more targets, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2856.7000000000003s)]
*  apply them to more sectors. More banks? More banks, more sectors that we haven't touched. Like what? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2861.9s)]
*  Well the commanding heights of the Russian economy. It's mostly about oil and gas [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2867.6600000000003s)]
*  but there are other sectors too. I don't want to specify them but I think Putin would know [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2873.1000000000004s)]
*  what those are. Dalip Singh's plan got added firepower he didn't expect when private companies [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2877.18s)]
*  started fleeing Russia. Coca-Cola, which sold coke in every nation except North Korea and Cuba, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2884.3799999999997s)]
*  suspended operations in Russia. McDonald's closed 850 restaurants. Boeing and Airbus have cut off [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2891.02s)]
*  the spare parts Russian airlines need to keep flying across a nation spanning 11 time zones. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2898.8599999999997s)]
*  In three weeks time 400 companies have left or closed their doors. Is doing business in Russia [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2906.22s)]
*  worth the aggravation? At this point the answer is no. David Schaeffer is the CEO of Kojin [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2913.66s)]
*  Communications. It provides high-speed internet service in 170 countries including Russia. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2920.62s)]
*  At this network operation center in Washington employees monitor the flow of internet traffic [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2927.66s)]
*  around the world. Kojin has terminated its service to carriers linked to the Russian government. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2933.82s)]
*  We were concerned that the size of the connections that we provide to those companies [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2940.6200000000003s)]
*  could be used offensively. To launch a cyber attack? That's correct. That was our number one [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2947.42s)]
*  motivation. Was there specific intelligence that you were seeing or traffic that you were seeing [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2953.9s)]
*  that concerned you? So we are routinely attacked and we had in normal times been attacked by state [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2960.14s)]
*  actors and by the GRU and we're particularly concerned that we were seeing unusual activity [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2972.62s)]
*  and the possibility of a much greater cyber attack. The GRU is the intelligence wing of the [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2981.58s)]
*  Russian military. It specializes in computer attacks. Schaeffer told us his decision to cut [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2988.86s)]
*  service in Russia would cost the company less than one percent of their revenue, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2995.1s)]
*  about 10 million dollars, so it wasn't worth the risk. We do not at this time have any physical [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=2999.5s)]
*  equipment inside of Russia that can be taken over. We do have equipment as far east as Kyrkov [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3006.94s)]
*  in the Ukraine. That equipment has been taken offline. That territory has been invaded by the [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3015.42s)]
*  Russians and we had to equip our equipment with effectively a dead man's switch. So once we lost [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3022.46s)]
*  connectivity to it, we had to disable the equipment in such a way that if the Russians took it, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3031.1s)]
*  it would do them no good. On Friday, in a case of audacious nation-state spin, the Central Bank [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3038.62s)]
*  of Russia referred to the exodus of companies and the cratering economy as a large-scale structural [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3045.9s)]
*  transformation. Days earlier, during a televised address, Vladimir Putin admitted his country's [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3052.62s)]
*  economy had taken a hit from the barrage of sanctions and warned it won't be easy for Russians [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3059.2599999999998s)]
*  who should expect a rise in prices and unemployment. The idea is to put so much pressure on him that he [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3064.94s)]
*  has to make a change to his policy. But could all that pressure backfire? Absolutely. Richard [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3071.1s)]
*  Neffue knows about dictators feeling cornered. Neffue worked on the Iran sanctions during the [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3076.94s)]
*  Obama administration and left the State Department last month. He told us sanctioning an autocrat [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3082.14s)]
*  such as Putin comes with risk. A couple weeks ago they were talking about alluring their strategic [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3088.38s)]
*  nuclear forces. They've already talked about how this is economic warfare and that they will retain [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3092.86s)]
*  the ability to respond accordingly. And if you think about that, right now they're in the midst [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3097.7400000000002s)]
*  of actual warfare. If their perception is that they're under attack from other countries, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3102.46s)]
*  that's a pretty scary thought. It's a delicate walk. It's one where you don't actually have a [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3107.26s)]
*  guidebook. There's no set of rules that tell you implement sanctions this far but not that far and [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3112.2200000000003s)]
*  take this step not that step. For Russia, what are the potential workarounds? Well, sanctions evasion [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3118.86s)]
*  is a long practice activity. There are ways in which they can work with other countries, potentially [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3124.94s)]
*  those that are subject to sanctions themselves. Venezuela, Iran, they could potentially also try [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3129.9s)]
*  and increase their relationship with China. And countries at one point have to make a decision, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3135.34s)]
*  are they really interested in helping out the Russians or are they more interested in helping [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3139.82s)]
*  out themselves? U.S. officials said Russia asked China for financial support. On Friday, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3143.9s)]
*  President Biden spoke with China's President Xi Jinping for two hours. We've been very clear [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3149.98s)]
*  with China about any support for this invasion and any help it may provide Russia in evading sanctions [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3155.5s)]
*  and we've also made it clear what those consequences would be. What would the consequences [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3162.3s)]
*  be? Sanctions? That's going to remain private. What is the first thing that Vladimir Putin needs to do? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3166.46s)]
*  So that you might lift sanctions? Well, we're nowhere near that point. The first thing he has [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3173.98s)]
*  to do is to stop a reckless and barbaric attack on the civilians of Ukraine. That's not happening. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3180.38s)]
*  Secretary of State, Andriy Blinken, told National Public Radio that ending Russia's economic [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3188.7000000000003s)]
*  isolation would require Putin to stop his war and agreed not to attack Ukraine again. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3194.2200000000003s)]
*  We're not cowboys and cowgirls pressing buttons to destroy an economy. We've spent hundreds of [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3202.6200000000003s)]
*  years in this country shaping military doctrine. We've spent a small fraction of that time shaping [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3208.7000000000003s)]
*  the doctrine of economic statecraft, but we have one. It's our objective to demonstrate resolve, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3214.3s)]
*  that sanctions should have the power to impose overwhelming costs on your target. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3219.1800000000003s)]
*  There are people who think the sanctions are only about regime change, that that's the ultimate goal. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3223.7400000000002s)]
*  That's up to the people of Russia. Our cause, our purpose is to make sure that Putin's actions [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3229.98s)]
*  are remembered as a strategic failure. That's what's within our control. Full stop. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL3BVO3k3U&t=3236.2999999999997s)]
