# Bernie Madoff and the largest known Ponzi scheme in history | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [August 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA)
*  It's been two and a half months since Bernard L. Madoff was picked up and charged with what's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=0.0s)]
*  believed to be the largest financial fraud in history. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=17.6s)]
*  Yet we still don't know much more about the alleged $50 billion scam than what Madoff [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=21.6s)]
*  initially told the FBI agents who arrested him. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=26.68s)]
*  There are still no indictments as federal prosecutors continue to unravel the case and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=30.08s)]
*  to try and figure out exactly what happened and who all was involved. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=34.56s)]
*  But the proof that it happened can be found in the ruined lives of thousands of victims. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=38.84s)]
*  The one person who knows the most and is willing to talk is Harry Markopolos, the man who figured [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  out Madoff's scheme before anyone else. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  He sat down with us for his only television interview. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Until a few months ago, Harry Markopolos was an obscure financial analyst and mildly [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=56.28s)]
*  eccentric fraud investigator from Boston who most people would never notice on the street. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=61.04s)]
*  My modern Greek hero. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=67.52s)]
*  But today he enjoys an almost heroic status, pursued by journalists and movie producers [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=68.52s)]
*  and honored by colleagues as the man who went to the Securities and Exchange Commission [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=74.6s)]
*  and blew the whistle on Bernie Madoff and his $50 billion fraud. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=86.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=87.28s)]
*  Please take your seats. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=88.28s)]
*  But he seems uncomfortable with all the attention and knows that he is no hero. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=89.28s)]
*  I stand before you a $50 billion failure. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=93.76s)]
*  How many times did you send material to the SEC? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=99.92s)]
*  May 2000, October 2001, October, November and December 2005, then again June 2007 and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=102.76s)]
*  April 2008. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=114.44000000000001s)]
*  So five separate SEC submissions. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=116.84s)]
*  In spite of all of the things that you did, it still ended up in disaster. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=120.48s)]
*  There's nothing to be proud about in this case. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=126.84s)]
*  I feel horrible about the result. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=128.36s)]
*  It's been a total disaster for the victims. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=129.8s)]
*  It began a decade ago when Markopolos was working for a Boston investment firm. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=134.28s)]
*  His boss told him that Bernard Madoff, a former chairman of the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, was [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=139.44s)]
*  running a huge unregistered hedge fund that was producing incredible returns. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  He wanted Harry to reverse engineer its trading strategy and revenue streams so that the firm [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=150.24s)]
*  could duplicate Madoff's results. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=155.6s)]
*  He had the patina of being a respected citizen, one of the most successful businessmen in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=157.68s)]
*  New York and certainly one of the most powerful men on Wall Street. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=162.84s)]
*  You would never suspect him of fraud unless you knew the math. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=166.0s)]
*  I mean, you're like a math guy, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=169.2s)]
*  I've taken all the calculus courses from integral calculus to differential calculus, as well [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=171.92s)]
*  as linear algebra and statistics, both normal and non-normal. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=176.44s)]
*  How long did it take you to figure out that there was something wrong? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  It took me five minutes to know that it was a fraud. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=183.32s)]
*  It took me another almost four hours of mathematical modeling to prove that it was a fraud. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=186.88s)]
*  What were the things that caught your attention? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  It was the performance line. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=196.28s)]
*  As we know, markets go up and down. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=198.36s)]
*  And his only went up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=201.16000000000003s)]
*  He had very few downed months. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=202.38000000000002s)]
*  Only 4% of the months were downed months. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=203.68s)]
*  And that would be equivalent to a baseball player in the major leagues batting 960 for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  a year. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=211.0s)]
*  Clearly impossible. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=212.0s)]
*  You would suspect cheating immediately. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=213.0s)]
*  Maybe it was just good. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=215.36s)]
*  No one's that good. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=217.0s)]
*  Harry said there were only two plausible explanations. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=218.56s)]
*  Either Madoff was using insider information to rack up huge profits or he was running [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=221.44000000000003s)]
*  a giant Ponzi scheme. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  So either way he was doing something illegal? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=228.54s)]
*  Either way I knew he was going to go to prison. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=230.94s)]
*  In May of 2000, Markopolos took his suspicions about Bernie Madoff to the Boston office of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=233.17999999999998s)]
*  the Securities and Exchange Commission. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=238.42s)]
*  Did you have any financial motive? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=240.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=243.01999999999998s)]
*  He was a competitor of mine in 2000 to 2004 while I was still in the industry. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  And when someone's competing on your playing field, who's a dirty player, you want him [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=248.94s)]
*  tossed off the field. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=253.64s)]
*  He also thought he might be eligible for a sizable reward if the fraud involved insider [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=255.34s)]
*  trading. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=260.38s)]
*  But that turned out not to be the case. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=261.38s)]
*  In your first letter to the SEC back in 2000, you're a little tentative. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=263.7s)]
*  You say, look, I have no smoking gun. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=269.5s)]
*  In 2000 it was more theoretical. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=272.56s)]
*  In 2001 it was a little bit more real. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=274.1s)]
*  By 2005 I had 29 red flags that you just couldn't miss on. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=278.02s)]
*  By 2005 the degree of certainty was approaching 100 percent. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=283.1s)]
*  Over time and with some simple math calculations, Markopolos concluded that for Madoff to execute [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=287.42s)]
*  the trading strategy he said he was using, he would have had to buy more options on the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=293.64000000000004s)]
*  Chicago Options Exchange than actually existed. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=298.62s)]
*  Yet he says no one he spoke to there remembered making a single trade with Bernie Madoff's [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=302.70000000000005s)]
*  fund. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=307.78000000000003s)]
*  I would talk to the people I had trading relationships with and ask, did you have a trading relationship [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=308.78000000000003s)]
*  with Mr. Bernard Madoff? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=313.34s)]
*  And they all said no, we don't think he's for real. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=315.1s)]
*  Did you find anybody? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=318.14s)]
*  I found no one that ever traded with Mr. Madoff and I traded with the largest equity derivatives [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=320.42s)]
*  firm in the world. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=324.3s)]
*  And that's because Madoff's investment fund never actually made any trades, at least going [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=325.46s)]
*  back to 1993 and probably further. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=330.1s)]
*  A fact confirmed last week at a meeting of Madoff investors by the trustee charged with [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=333.34000000000003s)]
*  liquidating his assets. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=338.62s)]
*  No one knew the depth of the fraud, but a lot of people had questions. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=340.86s)]
*  Who else figured this out besides you? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=345.62s)]
*  I would say that hundreds of people suspected something was amiss with the Madoff operation. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=348.26s)]
*  If you look at who the victims were not, you'll notice that the major firms on Wall Street [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  had no money with Mr. Madoff. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=360.06s)]
*  I mean you write in the, this is the letter, I'm quoting from the letter to the Securities [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=361.7s)]
*  and Exchange Commission, red flag number 20. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=365.58000000000004s)]
*  Madoff is suspected of being a fraud by some of the world's largest, most sophisticated [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=368.7s)]
*  financial services firms. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=372.53999999999996s)]
*  And then you list some of the firms. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=374.58s)]
*  Yes I do. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=375.82s)]
*  The biggest firms on Wall Street in conversations with people high up in those firms. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=376.82s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=381.65999999999997s)]
*  And the SEC ignored that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=382.7s)]
*  Did they call any of these people? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=385.9s)]
*  All the SEC had to do was pick up the phone. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=387.5s)]
*  They never did. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=389.38s)]
*  If you had executives at the biggest investment houses in Wall Street that knew something [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=390.38s)]
*  was wrong, why do you think they didn't go to the SEC? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=395.14s)]
*  Because people in glass houses don't throw stones and self-regulation on Wall Street [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=398.82s)]
*  doesn't work. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=402.74s)]
*  In January 2006, the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission finally [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=404.18s)]
*  opened a case file to look into Harry's allegations about Bernie Madoff. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=409.7s)]
*  Despite uncovering evidence that Madoff had misled them about his investment activities, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=414.7s)]
*  the SEC closed the case 11 months later without ever opening a formal investigation. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=419.66s)]
*  The staff said there was no evidence of fraud. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=425.62s)]
*  What I found out from my dealings with the SEC over eight and a half years is that their [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=428.74s)]
*  people are totally untrained in finance. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=432.46s)]
*  They're unschooled. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=434.7s)]
*  Most of them are just merely lawyers without any financial industry experience. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=435.98s)]
*  Well if the people there aren't trained in securities work, what are they trained in? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=440.22s)]
*  How to look at pieces of paper that the securities laws require. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=444.34000000000003s)]
*  They can check every piece of paper perfectly and find misdemeanors and they'll miss all [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=448.5s)]
*  the financial felonies that are occurring because they never look there. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=452.7s)]
*  Even when pointed to fraud, they're incapable of finding fraud. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=455.9s)]
*  No one at the SEC would talk to us on the record about Harry Markopolos' allegations, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=459.38s)]
*  but one person who seemed to have had a high opinion of the agency was Bernie Madoff. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=464.62s)]
*  I'm very close with the regulators. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=469.66s)]
*  I'm not trying to say that they can't, you know, that what they do is bad. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=471.06s)]
*  As a matter of fact, my niece just married one. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=474.22s)]
*  Besides his niece's husband who no longer works at the SEC, Madoff has had longstanding [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=476.06s)]
*  ties to the agency and has been called upon to give advice. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=481.42s)]
*  At this 2007 meeting of a non-profit group called the Phil Oktady Center, Madoff seemed [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=485.42s)]
*  to think the SEC was doing a great job. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=491.1s)]
*  You know in today's regulatory environment, it's virtually impossible to violate rules. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=493.82s)]
*  This is something that the public really doesn't understand, but it's impossible for you to [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=500.86s)]
*  go undetected, certainly not for a considerable period of time. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=506.41999999999996s)]
*  But don't try and tell that to the Phil Oktady Center today. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=512.26s)]
*  Its main benefactor, the Betty and Norman Levy Foundation, was fully invested in Madoff, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=515.9s)]
*  one of dozens of charitable organizations that have been devastated or wiped out. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=521.76s)]
*  Madoff's customer list, single-spaced with small type, is 162 pages long, with victims [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=526.9s)]
*  running the gamut from Hollywood royalty to a carpenter's pension fund in Syracuse, New York. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=533.74s)]
*  Shelley Ludlow has been forced to put her mother in a Medicaid assisted living facility [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=540.82s)]
*  while she packed up their apartment to move in with a friend, all because of Bernie Madoff. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=545.9000000000001s)]
*  Her whole lives were turned upside down by this man that sits in his penthouse and smirks. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=550.7s)]
*  The same day last week, 70 miles away, Len and Marge Forrest were leaving their house [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=558.34s)]
*  that they'd just sold in Setocke at Long Island and were preparing to drive to South Florida [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=567.46s)]
*  to sell their home there. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=572.7s)]
*  They had their money with Bernie Madoff for 30 years and lost an eight figure family fortune [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=574.6600000000001s)]
*  two days before his 80th birthday. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=580.08s)]
*  Do you have any money to live on? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=582.26s)]
*  Enough I would say for 60 days. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=585.18s)]
*  Do you know other people who are in the same situation? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=588.0999999999999s)]
*  Oh yes, we have a lot. Unfortunately and I think probably the thing that tears me up [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=590.8199999999999s)]
*  more than anything is the fact that I recommended Madoff to a number of people and they lost [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=597.42s)]
*  their money and I'll never stop feeling responsible for that. They were all close family and friends. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=606.14s)]
*  Len Forrest and his friends thought they were part of a small exclusive group of investors [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=613.74s)]
*  lucky enough to have a connection with Bernie Madoff. And because they thought they were [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=618.46s)]
*  making 12 percent a year, they weren't inclined to ask a lot of questions. Harry Markopolos [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=622.98s)]
*  called it the classic affinity scam. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=628.46s)]
*  An affinity scam is when you prey on groups that are similar in nature to yourself. So [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=631.02s)]
*  I'm Greek, if I was going to run an affinity scam I would run it on the Greek American [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=635.06s)]
*  community here. Bernie was Jewish so he ran it on the Jewish community in the United States [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=639.1s)]
*  but that wouldn't get him enough customers because he always needed new money to keep [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=644.5400000000001s)]
*  the scheme going. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=648.1s)]
*  Over time Madoff extended his reach from New York to Palm Beach where he enlisted hundreds [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=649.66s)]
*  of wealthy clients, many of them recruited from his own country clubs. And he also made [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=654.62s)]
*  connections that gave him entrée to Europe and the hedge fund capital of America, Greenwich, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=660.1s)]
*  Connecticut. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=665.7s)]
*  It was here that Bernie Madoff made some of his biggest deals with large investment firms [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=666.52s)]
*  that were willing to feed him billions of dollars of their clients' money to manage. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=671.4s)]
*  And in return, Bernie Madoff agreed to pay these so-called feeder funds a fortune in [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=676.12s)]
*  annual fees. The largest of the feeder funds was the Fairfield Greenwich Group. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=681.06s)]
*  How much money did Fairfield make off Bernie Madoff every year? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=686.62s)]
*  Hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=690.98s)]
*  If you're a feeder fund, what are you supposed to do for those hundreds of millions of dollars? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=692.42s)]
*  You're supposed to identify the world's best hedge fund managers and invest only in them [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=697.14s)]
*  and you're supposed to make sure they're not running Ponzi schemes. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=701.42s)]
*  The real steroids here were the feeder funds. That's what made it an international Ponzi [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=703.9399999999999s)]
*  scheme. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=711.18s)]
*  Attorney David Boyce is one of the most prominent lawyers in the country and is representing [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=712.38s)]
*  Fairfield Greenwich investors who lost nearly $7 billion when Madoff went under. They're [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=717.02s)]
*  suing the firm for gross negligence, claiming it failed to investigate Madoff thoroughly [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=722.78s)]
*  or monitor his activities as it promised to do in its marketing materials. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=728.0600000000001s)]
*  Analysis of portfolio composition, portfolio stress testing, risk management, asset verification, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=732.82s)]
*  you think that really happened? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=740.14s)]
*  No. We know it didn't happen because we know all they did was turn the money over to Bernie [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=741.38s)]
*  Madoff and they did that for 20 years. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=745.52s)]
*  They did nothing? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=747.84s)]
*  They essentially did nothing except lose their investors' money and enjoy very luxurious [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=748.88s)]
*  lifestyles from the money they took out. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=754.76s)]
*  Walter Knoll, one of the founding partners of Fairfield Greenwich, declined to talk to [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=757.76s)]
*  us and has reportedly been lying low with his wife at their compound on the private [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=761.92s)]
*  island of Mystique. But in a statement to 60 Minutes, his firm said that it too was [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=767.0s)]
*  a victim of Bernie Madoff, that it had placed too much trust in his then impeccable reputation [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=772.02s)]
*  and in the fact that there had been multiple reviews of Madoff by the SEC. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=778.1s)]
*  Mr. Madoff, what do you have to say for yourself? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=783.1s)]
*  In the end, Harry Markopolos had been right about Bernie Madoff. He will be going to prison. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=785.9399999999999s)]
*  But not because of anything that Harry or the SEC did. In a bad economy, Madoff's lies [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=791.54s)]
*  simply collapsed under their own weight. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=797.62s)]
*  No one was investigating Mr. Madoff at the end. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=800.42s)]
*  So he turned himself in before anybody in a position of authority began a serious investigation? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=802.6999999999999s)]
*  That's typically how the SEC does it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=809.3s)]
*  They come in after the crime has been committed. They toe-tag the victims, count the bodies [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=814.42s)]
*  and try to figure out who the crooks were after the fact, which does none of us any good. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=819.9399999999999s)]
*  Wall Street in shreds, the watchdogs fast asleep. Bonus stuffed executives laughing [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=830.42s)]
*  all the way out of the busted banks. It's been some year. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=841.2199999999999s)]
*  Oh, and we left out the Ponzi scheme of Ponzi schemes, Bernard Madoff's untidy little business [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=845.62s)]
*  that built thousands of people out of billions of dollars. While the mastermind is doing [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=852.86s)]
*  150 years in prison, the big question is, where did all the money go? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=858.1s)]
*  Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee, the liquidator, is searching for the billions [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=863.82s)]
*  that disappeared and trying to recover as much as possible from Madoff's remaining assets. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=869.74s)]
*  It's a daunting and thankless task. For while he's suing whoever he can on behalf of the [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=875.66s)]
*  victims, he's also suing many of the victims, those who he says benefited and should have [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=881.3000000000001s)]
*  known they were investing in a house of cards. Mr. Picard and his chief counsel, David Sheehan, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=887.82s)]
*  have been largely silent about the details of the recovery until tonight. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=894.22s)]
*  Last November, just before the whole thing collapsed, Bernard Madoff sent out statements [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=899.94s)]
*  to his clients. How much were they told they were worth? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=904.7800000000001s)]
*  About $64.8 billion. So the statements were total lies? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=909.1400000000001s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=913.62s)]
*  The $64.8 billion that investors thought they had was just an illusion. Designed by Madoff [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=915.86s)]
*  to keep investors investing. Last December, the roof fell in. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=923.98s)]
*  Mr. Madoff, what would you say to all those people that cost money, Mr. Madoff? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=928.98s)]
*  Mr. Madoff has no say in the matter. If the victims want money back, they'll have to go [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=932.58s)]
*  through Mr. Picard, the decider, and his bloodhound, Mr. Sheehan. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=937.34s)]
*  How much real money do you think went into the whole scheme? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=942.52s)]
*  I'd say about $36 billion, and about 18 of it went out before the collapse, and 18 of [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=945.72s)]
*  it's just missing. And that $18 billion is what we're trying to get back. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=953.72s)]
*  So for the past nine months, Picard and his team have been on a global treasure hunt. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=958.64s)]
*  The first step, liquidation. Madoff's boats, his art, even his season tickets to the New [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=963.68s)]
*  York Mets, plus Bertie's various homes, all sold or about to be sold with a U.S. Marshal [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=970.04s)]
*  as real estate pitchman. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=977.64s)]
*  Your eyes are drawn directly to the chandelier, which is probably worth a pretty penny. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=979.56s)]
*  They didn't exactly hide their wealth, did they? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=984.04s)]
*  They did have the house in Palm Beach, they had a place in Montauk, they had an apartment [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=987.28s)]
*  here in Park Avenue in the city, all of which are the accoutrements of great wealth. But [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=992.9599999999999s)]
*  it wasn't an extraordinary lifestyle. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=998.1600000000001s)]
*  How much is all that total? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1000.72s)]
*  According to the government, it's over $50 million. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1002.64s)]
*  Just a drop in an oversized bucket. Nothing close to what investors lost. So Picard and [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1006.72s)]
*  his team continued to follow the money. They started here. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1012.32s)]
*  This was the scene of the crime. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1017.1600000000001s)]
*  Madoff's New York offices, an impressive landscape of emptiness. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1019.1600000000001s)]
*  His desk was here. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1024.28s)]
*  And close by, perhaps a work of art that sums up the entire story. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1026.16s)]
*  It was called the soft screw. And it was about four, I guess, four to six feet high. And [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1031.24s)]
*  it was sitting right here. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1038.4s)]
*  And sitting on top of the world was Madoff himself. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1040.6000000000001s)]
*  He was much like the Wizard of Oz, just hiding behind this wall and no one could quite penetrate [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1044.16s)]
*  it, but they sort of really liked the results. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1050.44s)]
*  As far as you've been able to find out, was he ever legitimate? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1052.96s)]
*  No, he was never legitimate. And I think if he told the truth, which he's not capable [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1055.76s)]
*  of, he would then say, yes, I started out as a crook and I ended up as a crook. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1060.64s)]
*  And a crook who looked after his family. Picard's team unearthed records showing Madoff's sons, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1067.44s)]
*  Mark and Andrew, who ran a legitimate trading operation, and Madoff's brother Peter, the [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1073.68s)]
*  chief compliance officer, took $80 million in compensation over the past seven years. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1079.24s)]
*  Plus millions more in personal expenses charged to the company, private jet rentals, ski vacations, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1085.88s)]
*  and country club dues. Even Ruth, Madoff's wife, had a company credit card. And she charged [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1093.32s)]
*  millions too on everything from shopping sprees in Paris to movie rentals, all courtesy of [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1099.84s)]
*  Bernard L. Madoff Securities. Thank you very much. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1106.6s)]
*  They used the bank account at BLMIS like a personal piggy bank. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1110.8s)]
*  Of all the people that should have known, his brother and his sons who worked under [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1115.12s)]
*  the same roof with him should have known. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1120.0s)]
*  One would think so. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1123.1999999999998s)]
*  Did they know? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1124.1999999999998s)]
*  My belief is yes, they knew. And the reason I believe that is they were officers of these [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1125.7199999999998s)]
*  companies and directors in certain instances as well. And also compliance officers in a [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1130.6s)]
*  very highly regulated environment. So I think clearly they would have to have known what [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1135.9s)]
*  was going on, given their own personal transactions, the longevity of what was happening, and their [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1143.5400000000002s)]
*  responsibilities as officers of the company. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1149.38s)]
*  Madoff's sons and brother also had accounts with Bernie, and their returns were simply [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1152.46s)]
*  spectacular. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1157.14s)]
*  There is sort of an extraordinary event with Peter, his brother. After 1995, we only see [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1158.66s)]
*  him putting $14 in, and he took out over $16 million. We have to take a hard look at that. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1164.94s)]
*  Picard says Mark and Andrew Madoff withdrew over $35 million from accounts that were opened [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1173.1s)]
*  with little or no original investment. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1179.3s)]
*  If they turn out to be untouchable criminally, do you intend to bankrupt them civilly? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1182.58s)]
*  Whether or not they have a criminal problem, we will pursue them as far as we can pursue [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1189.26s)]
*  them. And if that leads to bankrupting them, then that's what will happen. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1198.5s)]
*  Picard and Sheehan told us they plan to file a suit this week against Madoff's sons, Mark [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1204.54s)]
*  and Andrew, his brother Peter, and niece Shauna, accusing them of negligence and breach of [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1209.54s)]
*  fiduciary duty in their roles at the company. They'll be seeking the return of $198 million [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1215.78s)]
*  that was paid out, loaned, or transferred to them. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1223.54s)]
*  When his brother took out money, or his sons took out money, they took customer money. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1227.18s)]
*  Can you lay claim to the sons' real estate, for example? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1232.74s)]
*  I believe that we can. The money that went to buy these houses under the law is called [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1236.62s)]
*  fraudulent transfers. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1241.34s)]
*  Maybe, but the Madoff sons are claiming they're still owed nearly $90 million by their father's [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1242.9399999999998s)]
*  bankrupt company. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1249.54s)]
*  Mr. Madoff? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1251.02s)]
*  Mark Madoff and the other family members maintained their innocence and declined our request for [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1252.06s)]
*  an interview. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1257.34s)]
*  I have no comment. I'm sorry. I can't help you. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1258.1399999999999s)]
*  But in a statement, the Madoff sons say Picard's allegations are baseless, that they had no [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1261.1s)]
*  prior knowledge of Bernard Madoff's crimes. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1266.96s)]
*  If you were those sons, and you knew what you knew today about where all that money [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1270.78s)]
*  came from, wouldn't you be embarrassed to keep that money? They should give it all back. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1275.86s)]
*  And if they don't give it all back, I think we have an obligation to go get it and take [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1281.46s)]
*  it all back. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1285.78s)]
*  And that includes mother Madoff Ruth. Though she's already agreed to forfeit about $80 [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1287.18s)]
*  million in assets, Picard has sued to keep her on a very short leash. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1292.6200000000001s)]
*  At the moment, any time she spends over $100, she has to check in with you, correct? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1298.26s)]
*  She reports it to us at the end of a month. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1303.8s)]
*  And how is she living now? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1305.9399999999998s)]
*  Very modestly. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1307.82s)]
*  The most significant amount of money that Ruth is currently spending is our lawyers. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1308.9399999999998s)]
*  There is an assumption in this case that there is this stash out there, whether in Swiss [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1313.12s)]
*  banks or under the mattress. Are you assuming there is? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1318.58s)]
*  Yes, we are. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1322.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1323.58s)]
*  What kind of money are we talking about? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1324.22s)]
*  We would assume it's millions and millions of dollars. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1326.38s)]
*  Millions and millions isn't nearly enough to cover the billions stolen by Bernie Madoff. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1329.3000000000002s)]
*  But here's where the story takes an odd twist. Most of the money for victims will not come [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1333.74s)]
*  from the Madoff family, but from some of the victims themselves. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1340.2600000000002s)]
*  Most people assume that everyone lost money who dealt with Madoff. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1345.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1350.7s)]
*  Not true. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1351.5s)]
*  We've found that there have been quite a few people who have gotten out more than they put in. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1352.66s)]
*  In fact, about half of Madoff's thousands of victims are what Picard calls net winners, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1358.94s)]
*  people who took out more money than they ever invested with Madoff. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1365.38s)]
*  We can tell that if Morley put in $100 and he got out $200, he got $100 of somebody else's money. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1369.6200000000001s)]
*  So the guy who's been happily taking $25,000 a year out over say 10 years, he's not going [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1376.54s)]
*  to get a dime out of this. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1382.8999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1384.58s)]
*  Not if he took out more than he put in. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1385.58s)]
*  Say he put in an initial $100,000. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1387.82s)]
*  Then he's already got more than he put in. He's been overpaid. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1391.18s)]
*  And are you going to try and get the difference? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1395.22s)]
*  Perhaps. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1398.1399999999999s)]
*  And he's entitled by law to get that difference back. It goes by the nicely nasty name of [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1399.34s)]
*  a clawback. If any investor took out more than they put in over the past six years, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1405.34s)]
*  Picard can legally demand it back to help victims who didn't take money out. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1411.58s)]
*  For now, Picard says Madoff's small-time winners are not his priority. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1416.9399999999998s)]
*  He's focusing on the big winners, who claim to be innocent victims. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1422.1s)]
*  Some of the big players, I believe, actually knew exactly what was going on and participated [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1427.6599999999999s)]
*  in it. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1432.74s)]
*  Picard and Sheehan have sued several prominent Madoff investors, saying they knew or should [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1433.74s)]
*  have known of the fraud, like billionaire investor and philanthropist Jeffrey Pickauer. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1439.22s)]
*  He got a statement that said his return was 950%. Now this isn't some unsophisticated [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1445.38s)]
*  rube buying these stocks and dealing in this. This is a very, very sophisticated guy. He [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1451.34s)]
*  gets a statement like that. That's off the charts. He doesn't do anything about that. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1456.74s)]
*  So is he a prime suspect? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1461.02s)]
*  Sure. I think not only in terms of the monies that he took out, but the records with regard [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1463.1399999999999s)]
*  to the relationship, the manipulation and backdating of trades, what you had to know, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1468.78s)]
*  or someone knew, is false. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1473.6599999999999s)]
*  The suit claims Pickauer took out more than $5 billion in profits since 1995. Picard is [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1475.58s)]
*  also suing another billionaire investor, Stanley Chase, who withdrew over a billion dollars [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1482.3799999999999s)]
*  in profits. Both Chase and Pickauer maintained their innocence and would not comment. But [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1488.18s)]
*  in court papers, Pickauer characterizes the suit as unsupported by facts or logic. Sheehan [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1494.38s)]
*  says he thinks they knew all along and simply couldn't resist the easy money. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1501.26s)]
*  I think as everyone was participating in this and just feeding at this trough of greed, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1507.02s)]
*  at the end of it what they were looking for was it to continue. They were hoping it was [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1513.22s)]
*  never going to end. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1517.42s)]
*  So far, the trustee and his counsel have filed 13 lawsuits seeking the return of nearly $15 [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1519.14s)]
*  billion from the biggest Madoff investors. In addition, 233 clawback notices have gone [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1525.7s)]
*  out to Madoff friends and family who may have profited from the scheme. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1533.3400000000001s)]
*  This is a human tragedy. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1538.98s)]
*  Thousands of smaller investors who were living off what they believed were legitimate profits [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1540.3400000000001s)]
*  now fear that on top of their lost nest egg, they may end up owing even more. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1545.5800000000002s)]
*  I opened my mailbox wondering if this will be the day when the letter arrives. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1551.22s)]
*  Sheehan is sympathetic, but... [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1556.74s)]
*  At the end of the day, they're in a Ponzi scheme, unfortunately for them. So all they [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1559.3400000000001s)]
*  get at best is what they put in. And to claim that they should be getting something other [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1563.74s)]
*  than that is to suggest that some other resource should exist. I'm talking about the taxpayers [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1569.18s)]
*  coming in and funding this. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1575.1s)]
*  So far, Picard has found nearly $1.5 billion for the victims fund and he's hoping to get [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1578.1s)]
*  several billion dollars more. But even then, victims will collect only a tiny fraction [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1584.5s)]
*  of what they lost. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1590.6599999999999s)]
*  We don't know how much is there, but it's going to be not necessarily pennies on the [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1592.2199999999998s)]
*  dollar, but it's only a little bit more than that. We're not going to be able to repay [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1595.5s)]
*  everyone. Not anything close to what they lost. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1601.8999999999999s)]
*  Madoff. It is a name that will live in infamy. It's been nearly three years since Bernard [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1614.82s)]
*  Madoff confessed to running a $65 billion Ponzi scheme, the largest financial fraud [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1620.5s)]
*  in history. Thousands of trusting clients who felt safe investing with a financial genius [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1626.74s)]
*  were swindled. He hadn't invested a penny. While Madoff is serving 150 years in prison, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1633.1s)]
*  his family has had to deal with the consequences of his crimes. His wife Ruth, divested of [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1640.46s)]
*  most of her great wealth and derided by a suspicious world. Their son Mark, dead, driven [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1645.98s)]
*  to suicide by shame and accusations of guilt. Their other son Andrew, isolated, trying to [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1652.42s)]
*  live with the disgrace. Are they innocent or were they willing partners? For the first [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1659.42s)]
*  time since Bernie Madoff's arrest, his son Andrew and wife Ruth speak out about crime, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1665.66s)]
*  punishment and the shame of being a Madoff. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1672.02s)]
*  It's a tough name to live with. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1675.98s)]
*  It sure is. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1678.3000000000002s)]
*  Ruth Madoff. You feel the shame? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1680.74s)]
*  Of course I feel the shame. I can barely walk down the street without worrying about people [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1682.98s)]
*  recognizing me. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1689.48s)]
*  And Andrew Madoff. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1691.5s)]
*  From the very beginning of this whole episode, I've had absolutely nothing to hide and I've [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1693.22s)]
*  been eager, I would say almost desperate, to speak out publicly and tell people that [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1700.5s)]
*  I'm absolutely not involved. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1707.18s)]
*  Andrew and Ruth Madoff speak out in the book Truth and Consequences, a more or less tell-all [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1709.78s)]
*  arranged by Andrew's fiance, Catherine Hooper, an attempt to separate the family from the [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1716.46s)]
*  father's crimes. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1722.62s)]
*  Is it dismaying for you that no matter what you say, people aren't going to believe you? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1724.46s)]
*  I think in many ways it is dismaying, but public opinion has to be something that doesn't matter [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1728.94s)]
*  to us. What matters to us is the truth. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1734.54s)]
*  It's really hard for people to believe that you didn't know, that you must have known. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1738.02s)]
*  I can't explain it. I mean, I trusted him. Why would it ever occur to me that it wasn't [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1743.9s)]
*  legal? The business was, his reputation was almost legendary. Why would I ever think that [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1753.62s)]
*  there was something sinister going on? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1762.1399999999999s)]
*  It was 1954 when Ruth Alpern met Bernie Madoff in Queens, New York. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1766.8s)]
*  I just saw him and I was sort of swept away, I think. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1772.76s)]
*  She married him at age 18. They had two sons, Mark, then Andrew. Bernie was building up [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1779.76s)]
*  his money management business, a typical middle-class family living on Long Island. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1786.24s)]
*  We were both solid parents and valued our family and so proud of our boys. It was a [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1792.56s)]
*  dream really. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1800.44s)]
*  My father was certainly present as a dad. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1801.8799999999999s)]
*  Did he emphasize moral values at all? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1804.6399999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't say that we sort of explicitly discussed values, but we certainly lived what [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1807.8s)]
*  was a moral life where there was a clear sense of right and wrong. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1817.36s)]
*  Exactly when Bernie Madoff went wrong is unclear, but as his reputation for delivering steady [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1824.36s)]
*  profits grew, the Madoffs began living the good life. A penthouse in Manhattan, homes [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1829.84s)]
*  in Palm Beach in the south of France, and yachts in both places. The family became celebrated [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1836.9199999999998s)]
*  for philanthropy and Madoff became a Wall Street big shot. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1843.76s)]
*  He was a big figure in the industry. He was the chairman of NASDAQ. He was constantly [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1848.6s)]
*  being honored as man of the year of this organization and that had an effect on me. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1853.92s)]
*  Both sons went to work as traders for their father's firm in the late 80s, a time authorities [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1860.92s)]
*  believe Madoff's Ponzi scheme was well underway. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1866.36s)]
*  Why would your father want to taint his sons by bringing into a situation that could well [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1870.96s)]
*  spell disaster? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1878.92s)]
*  That's a great question and that's something that I really agonize over as a son. What [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1880.72s)]
*  my father did was so horrible and it's hard for me to understand that and I'm not any [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1889.8400000000001s)]
*  closer to understanding it now than I was three years ago. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1897.84s)]
*  Bernard L. Madoff Securities employed over 100 people, but it seemed like a family business. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1902.6s)]
*  His brother Peter and several cousins worked there. Mark and Andrew worked on the 19th [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1909.32s)]
*  floor of New York's Lipstick building where they legitimately traded securities for the [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1915.0s)]
*  firm and for outside clients. The investment advisory business, the Ponzi scheme, was housed [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1920.36s)]
*  two floors below where their father never made any trades at all. He was simply creating [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1927.76s)]
*  phony paper statements that showed steady profits for his clients, his victims. Access [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1933.76s)]
*  to the 17th floor was highly restricted. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1940.9599999999998s)]
*  You must have been curious about why the 17th floor was such a secret place. When you or [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1944.92s)]
*  Mark asked him about his end of the business, what did he say? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1951.96s)]
*  It was always a very similar response. You guys have your business to worry about and [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1957.6000000000001s)]
*  let me worry about my business and the conversation would end there. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1963.24s)]
*  People say, look, there's no way these kids could not have, at the very least suspected [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1967.6000000000001s)]
*  something was going on. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1973.48s)]
*  Well, keep in mind, these were completely separate businesses. We were executing hundreds [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1976.08s)]
*  of thousands of transactions a day and that kept all of us incredibly busy. And it just [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1981.1200000000001s)]
*  didn't occur to me that he could be involved in any kind of criminal activity. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1987.6200000000001s)]
*  Andrew says his father would often walk his clients through the 19th floor to show actual [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=1993.96s)]
*  trades being made. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2000.28s)]
*  You feel that the legitimacy of the trading business offered protection to what your father [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2001.76s)]
*  was doing? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2008.3999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2009.36s)]
*  That he was using you and your brother? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2010.6s)]
*  Absolutely. It was one of the hardest things to come to grips with in trying to get my [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2013.24s)]
*  head around this was that feeling that I had been used almost as a human shield by him. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2019.06s)]
*  It's unforgivable. No father should do that to their sons. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2027.02s)]
*  The basic concept of Wall Street... [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2031.3799999999999s)]
*  He says he thought his father was a financial genius. There were suspicions about Madoff's [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2034.74s)]
*  remarkably consistent returns, but the SEC repeatedly cleared him of any wrongdoing. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2040.02s)]
*  What troubled Andrew was his father's refusal to discuss any plans for a succession. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2047.26s)]
*  His plan was that he had no plan. And he would say that when he dies, his end of the business [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2053.66s)]
*  dies, and again, it was always the same response. That's the way it is, and it's not going to [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2060.66s)]
*  change. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2065.66s)]
*  He ruled with an iron fist, but kept everyone happy with money, steady returns for investors, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2066.9s)]
*  and for family, an endless stream of cash. Andrew and Mark were paid multi-million dollar [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2074.02s)]
*  salaries, and the boys went to their father for even more, for houses, business ventures, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2079.82s)]
*  and divorce settlements. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2087.1000000000004s)]
*  Catherine Hooper says the Madoff benign dictatorship took some getting used to. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2089.02s)]
*  It was an adjustment, getting to understand that the boundaries in Andrew's family were [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2094.78s)]
*  probably going to be different than what I was used to. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2098.7400000000002s)]
*  Did you feel that Papa Madoff was the boss? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2101.78s)]
*  There's no question that he was. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2107.02s)]
*  He could be a bully, without question. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2108.38s)]
*  Did you ever suspect along the way, either strange behavior or somebody who was bottling [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2110.54s)]
*  up a secret? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2117.42s)]
*  I never did. I never did. It didn't seem that way. There was nothing that would make me [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2118.98s)]
*  suspect anything. Sometimes I look back and I think as the years went on, he started to [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2124.82s)]
*  get more and more short tempered, and maybe he just was having trouble. Obviously, he [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2132.78s)]
*  had to have been. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2139.78s)]
*  In the fall of 2008, the world economy began to implode, and markets were in free fall. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2141.5800000000004s)]
*  Big investors wanted out. Redemption after redemption strained Madoff's scheme to its [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2148.42s)]
*  limits. On December 10, 2008, with only a few hundred million left of the billions invested [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2154.5s)]
*  with him, Madoff realized the game was over. He told his wife to transfer $10 million from [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2161.7s)]
*  her brokerage account of the firm into a personal checking account. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2168.34s)]
*  Did you not wonder what on earth is happening here? $10 million is a lot of money. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2172.54s)]
*  It wasn't atypical for him to put money in an account and take it out. I didn't think [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2178.1s)]
*  anything of it, actually. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2184.1s)]
*  That same morning, Bernard Madoff called a family meeting in his office. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2186.82s)]
*  And he started to try and speak to us, and he couldn't. He sort of fell apart, started [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2192.82s)]
*  to cry a little bit, and it was shocking to see that. I mean, this was not a man who was [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2202.7400000000002s)]
*  emotional in that way at all. He said that maybe it would be easier if we talked elsewhere, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2210.74s)]
*  and he suggested maybe we should go up to his apartment. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2217.9399999999996s)]
*  He called from the office and said, I'm coming home with the boys. I have something to talk [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2220.66s)]
*  about. He came in. We went into a room, four of us, and he said, I have a confession to [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2225.4199999999996s)]
*  make. I've been running a Ponzi scheme. He said $50 billion. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2232.42s)]
*  He said, everything I've been doing is all a big lie. He said the business is a Ponzi [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2242.06s)]
*  scheme and the firm is completely insolvent and unbroke. And then he just started sobbing. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2252.26s)]
*  And I was shocked. I felt like my head exploded. I mean, I don't think if he had told me he [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2259.38s)]
*  was an alien, I could have been more surprised. He said that the firm had liabilities of $50 [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2268.38s)]
*  billion. It never occurred to me that his business had anything like that kind of, anything [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2275.38s)]
*  like that under management. It was shocking. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2284.78s)]
*  What about your mother? What was her reaction? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2287.2999999999997s)]
*  She looked shocked. She asked, what's a Ponzi scheme? It was her first question. She didn't [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2289.8599999999997s)]
*  even understand that. I think it was me who answered and said that it means that it's [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2299.2999999999997s)]
*  all fake, that Dad's, you know, he's not been doing what he says he's been doing. And he [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2303.7799999999997s)]
*  followed that up and said, yes, I've been lying to all of you all of these years. I've [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2312.3799999999997s)]
*  been lying to everybody. I've been lying to myself, he said. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2316.66s)]
*  And your brother? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2319.3799999999997s)]
*  My brother was trembling with rage. He was absolutely furious. Mark was the first one [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2320.5s)]
*  to stand up and said, you know, I'm out of here. And he stormed out of the room. And [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2328.62s)]
*  I immediately followed him and walked out. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2333.18s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of people out there who are saying, or will be saying as they [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2337.58s)]
*  watch this, this is all a charade. This was something that the Madoffs set up to get himself [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2342.34s)]
*  off the hook. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2348.98s)]
*  I wish it were. I wish it were. I wish none of this was real. You know, I knew absolutely [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2350.78s)]
*  nothing about this before my father shared the information with me. And it was the most [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2355.98s)]
*  shocking and terrible moment of my life. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2362.02s)]
*  I was as stunned as they. I was kind of paralyzed. Bernie got up and said, I'm going to go to [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2365.2200000000003s)]
*  the office. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2372.34s)]
*  Was he emotional in any way? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2373.34s)]
*  I don't remember that either. He must have been. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2376.34s)]
*  Apologetic in any way? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2379.34s)]
*  Probably, yes. It's sort of a blank now. I'm not hedging here. I just simply don't remember [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2382.34s)]
*  every detail. I was in such a state. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2391.1400000000003s)]
*  And later that day, that evening, you both turned up at the office Christmas party. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2394.34s)]
*  I know he phoned me from the office and said we have to go to the office Christmas party. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2400.06s)]
*  So I got myself together and went over there. We stayed a half an hour. And we just went [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2405.06s)]
*  home. And the next morning, the FBI was there to arrest him at about 7 a.m. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2413.06s)]
*  Andrew and Mark Madoff had turned their father in. Shortly after the arrest, Ruth Madoff [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2420.06s)]
*  called Andrew pleading with him to co-sign his father's $10 million bail bond. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2425.46s)]
*  And I said, you know, forget it. There's no way. I mean, how could you even ask that question? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2431.46s)]
*  No, I'm not signing that bail bond. That's crazy. And I was really, I was very upset [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2437.46s)]
*  that she asked because here I had just turned my father into the authorities a day before. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2444.46s)]
*  And now it appeared that I was losing my mother as well because she was siding with him. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2451.46s)]
*  I just wanted him to come home. I was so afraid. Afraid of? I mean, the whole idea of going [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2457.46s)]
*  to prison was sort of unthinkable to me. I don't think I ever knew anybody that went to prison. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2464.46s)]
*  Mr. Madoff, what do you have to say for yourself? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2472.46s)]
*  Bail was eventually guaranteed by Ruth and Madoff's brother Peter. And Bernie was released. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2476.46s)]
*  All of his assets were frozen. But in a stunning breach of the court order barring the transfer of property, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2482.46s)]
*  a large and extremely valuable envelope arrived at Andrew Madoff's apartment. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2489.46s)]
*  I tore open the envelope and dumped it out. And it was absolutely heartbreaking. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2495.46s)]
*  These were pieces of jewelry that I recognized, things that I had seen my mother wearing over the years. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2502.46s)]
*  And I couldn't understand how she could do this. I mean, what were they thinking? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2509.46s)]
*  And it wasn't until three years later that I had a chance to ask her, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2516.46s)]
*  what were you thinking when you sent me that jewelry? I don't understand. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2524.46s)]
*  And she told me that she and my father planned to kill themselves. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2529.46s)]
*  And they put together that package beforehand and sent it out. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2535.46s)]
*  Did they try to kill themselves? Yes, they did. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2541.46s)]
*  I don't know whose idea it was, but we decided to kill ourselves because it was so horrendous. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2546.46s)]
*  What was happening? We had terrible phone calls, hate mail, just beyond anything. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2556.46s)]
*  And I said, I just can't go on anymore. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2563.46s)]
*  That's when I packed up some things to send to my sons and my grandchildren. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2569.46s)]
*  I had some lovely antique things and things that I thought they might want. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2575.46s)]
*  I mailed them. It was Christmas Eve. That added to the whole depression. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2581.46s)]
*  We took pills and woke up the next day. What did you take? I think Ambien. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2586.46s)]
*  How many? I don't even remember. I took what we had. He took more. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2594.46s)]
*  Did you leave notes? No. It was very impulsive. And I'm glad we woke up. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2602.46s)]
*  But you must have talked. This is a rather hard decision to make. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2610.46s)]
*  It wasn't hard at the time. It was impulsive and I just wanted out. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2616.46s)]
*  When we come back, life in the Madoff apartment and the death of a son. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2622.46s)]
*  The sheer scale of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme shocked the world. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2628.46s)]
*  Thousands of individuals, charities and funds that on paper were worth a total of $65 billion were wiped out. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2640.46s)]
*  What's more, some of his closest friends and family who had trusted him with their life savings faced ruin. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2649.46s)]
*  With Madoff under house arrest, the world staked out his penthouse on 64th Street, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2657.46s)]
*  obsessed by what might be happening behind the drawn shades. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2665.46s)]
*  There were lawyers coming to meetings at the apartment. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2670.46s)]
*  We watched a lot of television and I cooked. Was there remorse? Yes, there was remorse. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2674.46s)]
*  Was there guilt? Or was it sort of self-pity? I think in a way he was relieved at the beginning that he was finished. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2682.46s)]
*  But you must have asked yourself a thousand times why. You could have been a perfectly comfortable, even wealthy family. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2690.46s)]
*  Without question. Without this? I don't understand it. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2701.46s)]
*  I don't, it's hard for me to say this, but I don't think the money was the part of it. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2705.46s)]
*  I think he got stuck. That's what he said. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2713.46s)]
*  And he didn't have the courage to face things when they might have been able to be faced on a much smaller scale. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2717.46s)]
*  Madoff repeatedly told authorities that he had acted alone. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2727.46s)]
*  Did your wife have anything to do with this, sir? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2731.46s)]
*  That his family knew nothing. But who would believe Bernie Madoff? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2734.46s)]
*  I remember at some point we were having breakfast and I said to Andrew, you know, people will think that you were involved. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2739.46s)]
*  And I think it had dawned on him, but it really hadn't sunk in. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2746.46s)]
*  And as I said those words, he looked at me and said, do you really think that that won't last? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2752.46s)]
*  I mean, it'll become clear very quickly that we weren't involved. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2756.46s)]
*  Did you have any suspicion at all that your mother might have been involved, complicit in some way? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2760.46s)]
*  No, absolutely not. I never for a moment felt that my mother was involved in my father's crimes or was aware of it at all. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2765.46s)]
*  The rest of the world was skeptical. While countless stories predicted the imminent arrest of Mark, Andrew and their uncle Peter. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2772.46s)]
*  Do you have anything to say to the investors? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2779.46s)]
*  Ruth Madoff seemed to get the worst of it. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2781.46s)]
*  It was said she had an office at the firm, that she had been the bookkeeper. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2784.46s)]
*  I was the bookkeeper. I was the receptionist. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2790.46s)]
*  I worked for Bernie in 1961 when I graduated from college. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2794.46s)]
*  And I left in 1963 when Mark was born and then Andy and I was a stay at home mom all those years. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2800.46s)]
*  And later on when the boys started to work there, we lived within walking distance. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2808.46s)]
*  And I had an office there where I took care of decorating things and house things and boat bills and managing those things. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2816.46s)]
*  But I was never the bookkeeper after 1963. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2826.46s)]
*  Probably a majority of people can't believe that you can live with someone for 50 years and not know. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2830.46s)]
*  It's hard for me to believe too. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2840.46s)]
*  Had you known, would you have turned him in? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2842.46s)]
*  I'm glad I didn't. It would have been tough, but I would have left. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2845.46s)]
*  Whether I turned him in or not, I don't know. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2852.46s)]
*  I'd like to think I would have, but I couldn't say. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2855.46s)]
*  I'm being completely honest with you, I have to say. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2862.46s)]
*  She was vilified and shunned, harassed on the subway. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2867.46s)]
*  The press hounded her with headline after headline. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2871.46s)]
*  Her fiercest critics were her own sons. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2875.46s)]
*  From the time of your father's confession, I gather you had a certain degree of estrangement from your mother. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2878.46s)]
*  How come? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2885.46s)]
*  Well, she and I barely spoke for two years. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2887.46s)]
*  I struggled tremendously trying to understand her decision to stay by my father's side. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2892.46s)]
*  I felt so angry with him, so I didn't understand her choice, and I struggled with it, as did Mark. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2902.46s)]
*  I never thought of leaving. I don't know why I didn't. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2912.46s)]
*  I just knew this man for so long whom I loved for so many years. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2916.46s)]
*  I didn't know what else to do but stay there. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2922.46s)]
*  Three months after his confession, Madoff pled guilty. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2926.46s)]
*  He was later sentenced to 150 years. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2930.46s)]
*  Ruth Madoff agreed to forfeit $80 million and all her worldly goods. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2934.46s)]
*  All the homes, boats, cars, furniture, even Madoff's slippers were auctioned or sold. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2940.46s)]
*  You were allowed to keep $2.5 million. To a lot of people, that's a lot of money. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2947.46s)]
*  It is certainly enough for me. I've used a lot for legal fees. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2953.46s)]
*  There is a public perception, and I'm sure you've heard it, that there's got to be a stash somewhere. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2958.46s)]
*  I've heard it. I've heard it. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2965.46s)]
*  That Bernie Madoff hid it somewhere and that you know about it or Andrew knows about it or you both know about it. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2968.46s)]
*  My understanding of the Ponzi scheme is that when it's over, there's nothing left, and I certainly don't know of a stash anywhere. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2976.46s)]
*  Though eight employees have been accused of helping with the scheme, no family members have been charged. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2986.46s)]
*  But the bankruptcy trustee Irving Picard and his lead counsel David Sheehan are demanding that all the Madoffs cough up virtually every penny they have, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=2993.46s)]
*  claiming they, quote, knew or should have known about Bernie's crimes. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3003.46s)]
*  Would you agree with Mr. Sheehan, the lawyer for the trustee, when Sheehan says you should be ashamed, that you should give every penny back? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3009.46s)]
*  Well, obviously I disagree with many of the assertions in the lawsuit that the trustee has filed against me. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3019.46s)]
*  And I'm hopeful that in time we'll be able to reach a settlement and I'll be able to put this behind me. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3026.46s)]
*  Picard says the son's trading operation received millions from Bernie's Ponzi scheme. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3033.46s)]
*  He's suing Andrew Madoff alone for $60 million, virtually every penny he earned, borrowed or was given to him by his father over a 10-year period. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3039.46s)]
*  Let me ask a really intrusive question. How much are you worth as we speak? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3051.46s)]
*  Well, I was fortunate over the years running the business that Mark and I ran that generated many millions of dollars in profits [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3057.46s)]
*  and enabled my brother and I both to live a comfortable lifestyle. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3067.46s)]
*  You haven't answered the question. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3073.46s)]
*  I made in good years several million dollars. My life at this point is an open book. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3075.46s)]
*  The details of my financial past have been laid bare completely in the lawsuit against me. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3083.46s)]
*  I haven't enjoyed it, but that's the reality that I live in. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3089.46s)]
*  Do you fear ending up broke? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3093.46s)]
*  I think that it's a very real possibility, but I am prepared to start over again and build myself back up. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3095.46s)]
*  Have you talked to your dad? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3103.46s)]
*  I have no comment, I'm sorry. I can't help you. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3104.46s)]
*  But for Andrew's brother Mark, the weight of the lawsuits, attacks from the media and the shame became unbearable. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3107.46s)]
*  He was absolutely obsessed with the news coverage. He would wake up every morning, immediately comb through the regular newspapers [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3115.46s)]
*  and that would be followed up by reading blog posts and comments and I would say, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3125.46s)]
*  You've got to shut off your computer. You've got to stop subjecting yourself to this because this is not helpful for you [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3131.46s)]
*  and it's not helpful for me and if you keep doing this it's just going to lead to misery. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3137.46s)]
*  And it did. On December 11, 2010, the second anniversary of his father's arrest, Mark Madoff hung himself [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3144.46s)]
*  while his two-year-old son slept in the next room. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3153.46s)]
*  He said in his last email, no one wants to hear the truth. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3157.46s)]
*  As soon as we saw the caller ID at that early hour on a Saturday morning, we both knew what had happened. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3162.46s)]
*  How did you react when you heard that? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3171.46s)]
*  It was awful. I wish I could say I was shocked, but I wasn't. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3178.46s)]
*  He had tried to kill himself a little more than a year before and that was absolutely devastating. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3185.46s)]
*  I had tried to talk to him to understand what he was going through. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3199.46s)]
*  It was very painful for me and very difficult for me, but I was making it through. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3207.46s)]
*  And to see him struggling and not making it was terrible. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3212.46s)]
*  We were very close. He was my best friend and I wanted to help him. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3219.46s)]
*  The night before he killed himself, there was an awful article in the Wall Street Journal. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3226.46s)]
*  I understood I was going through those agonies of shame. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3233.46s)]
*  It was terrible to feel that we were always so proud of who we were and Bernie's success in the industry. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3240.46s)]
*  It was so difficult. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3251.46s)]
*  She blames herself for Mark's suicide. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3256.46s)]
*  He'd wanted her to cut off all contact with her husband. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3259.46s)]
*  I just wish until my dying day that I had done what he wanted. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3264.46s)]
*  I don't know if it would have made a difference or not, but if I could change things, at least if I had tried, I would have felt a little better. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3270.46s)]
*  I don't know if it would have mattered. It's the most awful thing that could happen to anybody. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3281.46s)]
*  Suicide of a child. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3286.46s)]
*  After her son's death, Ruth Madoff told her husband she was finished with him. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3290.46s)]
*  No visits, no phone calls. That decision led to a reconciliation of sorts with Andrew. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3296.46s)]
*  That's partly why I'm sitting right here. He and Catherine wanted to write this book. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3303.46s)]
*  I thought it would be good if I was a part of it, and I agreed because I wanted to reconcile. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3309.46s)]
*  Neither Ruth nor Andrew will benefit from sales of the book. Catherine Hooper will. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3318.46s)]
*  You live just over there. You miss the apartment? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3324.46s)]
*  Not really. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3328.46s)]
*  She lives a simpler life now in a three-room apartment in South Florida. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3329.46s)]
*  But she remains Ruth Madoff, lawful wife of the greatest financial criminal in history. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3334.46s)]
*  Why haven't you filed for a divorce from this man? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3341.46s)]
*  I don't know. It doesn't matter to me. He's going to die in prison. I certainly don't want to find another man these days. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3345.46s)]
*  He'll probably see this interview. Are you concerned about that? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3354.46s)]
*  I was thinking about that. No, I'm not concerned. He should hear it. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3358.46s)]
*  Believe it or not, the thousands of victims may have little sympathy for Andrew and Ruth, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3364.46s)]
*  but it can't be denied that they too are victims of Bernie Madoff. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3371.46s)]
*  That's Mark and Andrew. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3376.46s)]
*  Mm-hmm. And happier times. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3378.46s)]
*  They lost a son and brother and will forever carry the shame of the Madoff name. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3381.46s)]
*  What he did to me, to my brother, and to my family is unforgivable. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3387.46s)]
*  What he did to thousands of other people, destroyed their lives. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3393.46s)]
*  I'll never understand it and I'll never forgive him for it and I'll never speak to him again. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3398.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luS_BL2TbOA&t=3417.46s)]
