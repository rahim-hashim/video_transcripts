# World War II Stories | 60 Minutes Marathon
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg)
*  Good evening, I'm John Wertheim, welcome to 60 Minutes Presents. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=0.0s)]
*  For as casually as we often toss around the word hero, sometimes no lesser term applies, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=17.18s)]
*  tonight we'll introduce you to members of a secret American intelligence unit who fought [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=23.52s)]
*  in World War II. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=28.54s)]
*  What's most extraordinary about this group? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=30.419999999999998s)]
*  Many of them were German-born Jews who fled their homeland, came to America, and then [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  joined the US Army. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=37.8s)]
*  Their mission? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=39.42s)]
*  To use their knowledge of the German language and culture to return to Europe and fight [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=40.42s)]
*  Nazism. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=45.06s)]
*  The Richie Boys, as they were known, trained in espionage and frontline interrogation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=46.34s)]
*  And incredibly, they were responsible for most of the combat intelligence gathered [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=51.66s)]
*  on the Western Front. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=56.019999999999996s)]
*  For decades, they didn't discuss their work. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=57.7s)]
*  Fortunately, some of the Richie Boys are still around to tell their tales, and that includes [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=60.34s)]
*  the life force that is Guy Stern, age 99. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=64.98s)]
*  You work six days a week, you swim every morning, you lecture. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=70.38s)]
*  Any signs of slowing down? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=75.06s)]
*  Well, I think not. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=76.98s)]
*  But I don't run as fast, I don't swim as fast, but I feel happy with my tasks. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=80.66000000000001s)]
*  Just two weeks shy of turning 100, Guy Stern drips with vitality. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=89.06s)]
*  He still works six days a week. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  And if you get up early enough, you might catch him working out at his local park in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  the suburbs of Detroit. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=101.02000000000001s)]
*  But ask him about his most formative experience, and he doesn't hesitate. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=103.22s)]
*  It was his service in the military during World War II. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=107.98s)]
*  What was it like for you, leaving Nazi Germany, escaping as a Jew, and the next time you [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=111.94s)]
*  go back to Europe, it's to fight those guys? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=116.9s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=119.62s)]
*  I was a soldier doing my job. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  And that precluded any concern that I was going back to a country I once was very attached [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=124.62s)]
*  to. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=132.38s)]
*  I had a war to fight, and I did it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=133.38s)]
*  This is Guy Stern 80 years ago. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  He's among the last surviving Ritchie Boys, a group of young men, many of them German [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=141.54s)]
*  Jews, who played an outsized role in helping the Allies win World War II. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=146.57999999999998s)]
*  They took their name from the place they trained, Camp Ritchie, Maryland, a secret American [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  military intelligence center during the war. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=156.84s)]
*  Starting in 1942, more than 11,000 soldiers went through the rigorous training at what [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=160.46s)]
*  was the Army's first centralized school for intelligence and psychological warfare. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=165.74s)]
*  The purpose of the facility was to train interrogators. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  That was the biggest weakness that the Army recognized it had, which was battlefield intelligence [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  and the interrogation needed to talk to sometimes civilians, most of the time prisoners of war, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=180.9s)]
*  in order to glean information from them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=188.24s)]
*  David Fry is a professor of history and director of the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=190.52s)]
*  at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  How effective were they at gathering intelligence? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  They were incredibly effective. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=202.36s)]
*  Sixty plus percent of the actionable intelligence gathered on the battlefield was gathered by [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=204.96s)]
*  Ritchie Boys. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=211.24s)]
*  Sixty percent of the actionable intelligence? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=212.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=214.68s)]
*  They made a massive contribution to essentially every battle that the Americans fought, the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=215.68s)]
*  entire sets of battles on the Western Front. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=221.12s)]
*  Recruits were chosen based on their knowledge of European language and culture, as well [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  as their high IQs. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=229.82s)]
*  Essentially they were intellectuals. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=232.12s)]
*  The largest set of graduates were 2,000 German-born Jews. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=233.96s)]
*  If we take Camp Ritchie in microcosm, it was almost the ideal of an American melting pot. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=238.28s)]
*  You had people coming from all over, uniting for a particular cause. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=244.68s)]
*  All in service of winning the war. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  All in service of winning the war, and there's nothing that forges unity better than having [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=251.24s)]
*  a common enemy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=255.18s)]
*  You had a whole load of immigrants who really wanted to get back into the fight. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=256.68s)]
*  Immigrants like Guy Stern. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=262.32s)]
*  He grew up in a close-knit family in the town of Hildesheim, Germany. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=264.04s)]
*  When Hitler took power in 1933, Stern says the climate grew increasingly hostile. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  My fellow students, it was an all-male school, withdrew from you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=275.48s)]
*  Because you were Jewish, you were ostracized. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=281.14000000000004s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=284.16s)]
*  I went to my father one day and I said, classes are becoming a torture chamber. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=285.56s)]
*  By 1937, violence against Jews was escalating. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  In advancing danger, Stern's father tried to get the family out. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=297.32s)]
*  But the Sterns could only send one of their own to the U.S. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=301.0s)]
*  They chose their eldest son. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=305.2s)]
*  Do you remember saying goodbye to your family? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=307.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=310.04s)]
*  What do you remember from that? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=311.04s)]
*  Handkerchiefs. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=312.96s)]
*  I couldn't know at that point that I would never see my siblings or my parents again, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=313.96s)]
*  nor my grandmother, and so forth and so on. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=322.36s)]
*  Guy Stern arrived in the U.S. alone at age 15, settling with an uncle in St. Louis. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=326.52s)]
*  When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, Stern, by then a college student, raced to enlist. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=334.47999999999996s)]
*  I had an immediate, visceral response to that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=342.56s)]
*  And that was, this is my war for many reasons, personal of course, but also this country [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  I was really treated well. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  In New York, Paul Fairbrook had a similar impulse. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  Now 98, Fairbrook is the former dean of the Culinary Institute of America. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=363.20000000000005s)]
*  His Jewish family left Germany in 1933, when he was 10. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=368.72s)]
*  Why did you want to enlist initially? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=373.64000000000004s)]
*  Look, I'm a German Jew and there's nothing that I wanted more as to get some revenge [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=375.12s)]
*  on Hitler who killed my uncles and my aunts and my cousins. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=381.3s)]
*  And there was no question in my mind, and neither of all the men in Camp Ritchie, so [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=385.58s)]
*  many of them were Jewish, we were all on the same wavelength. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=390.18s)]
*  We were delighted to get a chance to do something for the United States. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=394.58s)]
*  At the time though, the military wouldn't take volunteers who weren't born in the U.S. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=399.06s)]
*  But within a few months, the government realized these so-called enemy aliens could be a valuable [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=404.26s)]
*  resource in the war. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=410.0s)]
*  Why were the Ritchie boys so successful? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=412.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, because it was an unusual part of the United States Army. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  You can learn to shoot a rifle in six months, but you can't learn fluent German in six months, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=418.92s)]
*  and that's what the key to success was. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=423.7s)]
*  Was it your knowledge of the language or your knowledge of the psychology and the German [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=426.48s)]
*  culture? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=430.92s)]
*  Oh, that's a very good question. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=431.92s)]
*  That is the key to being a good interrogator. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=434.88s)]
*  You really know an awful lot of the subtleties when you're having a conversation with another [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=438.36s)]
*  German. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=444.24s)]
*  And we were able to find out things in their answers that enabled us to ask more questions. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=445.24s)]
*  You really have to understand it helps to have been born in Germany in order to do a good job. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=451.64s)]
*  Both refugees like Fairbrook and Stern, as well as a number of American-born recruits [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=460.24s)]
*  with requisite language skills, were drafted into the Army and sent to Camp Ritchie. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=465.4s)]
*  How did you find out you were going to go to Camp Ritchie? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=470.86s)]
*  I was called to the company office and told, you're shipping out. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=473.54s)]
*  And I said, may I know where I'm going? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=480.42s)]
*  He said, no, military secret. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=483.65999999999997s)]
*  He's worried of secrecy. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=487.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=489.5s)]
*  While it was only a resort, Camp Ritchie was a curiously idyllic setting to prepare for [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=490.62s)]
*  the harshness and brutality of war. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=495.46s)]
*  Nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Maryland, it was away from prying eyes and prying spies, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=498.38s)]
*  but close enough to decision makers at the Pentagon. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=504.22s)]
*  Give us a sense of the kinds of courses they took. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=507.5s)]
*  Well, the most important part of the training was that they learned to do interrogation, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=510.22s)]
*  in particular of prisoners of war. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=516.46s)]
*  This is where you want to get people to talk to you. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=519.1s)]
*  You want to convince them that you're trustworthy. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=521.7s)]
*  You want to give them that feeling that you know who they are, they know who you are. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=523.64s)]
*  You know a lot about them already, so whatever information they're giving you is information [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=528.5s)]
*  that you probably already know. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=535.14s)]
*  But they also did terrain analysis. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=537.38s)]
*  They also did photo analysis and aerial reconnaissance analysis. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=539.4200000000001s)]
*  They did counterintelligence training. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=544.4200000000001s)]
*  This is really a broad range of intelligence activity. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=546.46s)]
*  It was a very broad range, and they did it all generally in eight weeks. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=549.58s)]
*  You describe it almost sounds like these were precursors to CIA agents. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=554.5s)]
*  They were, in fact. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=559.22s)]
*  Some of them were trained as spies, and some of them went on to careers as spies. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=560.4000000000001s)]
*  My parents were pacifists, so the idea of my going to war was for them calamitous. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=564.9000000000001s)]
*  However, they realized that it was a necessary war, especially for us. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=572.18s)]
*  Victor Brombert, now 98 years old, is a former professor of Romance Languages and Literature [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=577.62s)]
*  at Yale and then Princeton. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=583.3399999999999s)]
*  He was born in Berlin to a Russian Jewish family. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=585.5s)]
*  When Hitler came to power, the Bromberts fled to France and then to the U.S. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=588.9599999999999s)]
*  Eager to fight the Nazis, he too joined the army. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=594.14s)]
*  After recruiters found out he spoke four languages, they dispatched him to Camp Richey, where [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=597.94s)]
*  strenuous classroom instruction was coupled with strenuous field exercises. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=603.3000000000001s)]
*  They were long and demanding exercises and close combat training, how to kill a sentry [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=609.0600000000001s)]
*  from behind. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=619.3000000000001s)]
*  I thought, I'm never going to do that, but I was shown how to do it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=620.3000000000001s)]
*  Physical combat training as well as intelligence. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=625.6400000000001s)]
*  You take your, sort of, swing it around the neck from behind and then pull. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=627.66s)]
*  Among the unusual sights at Richey, a team of U.S. soldiers dressed in German uniforms. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=632.78s)]
*  The Richey boys trained for war against these fake Germans with fake German tanks made out [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=638.5s)]
*  of wood. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=643.4s)]
*  Another unusual sight, towering over recruits, Frank Levitt, a World War I veteran and pro-wrestling [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=644.9399999999999s)]
*  star at the time, was among the instructors. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=651.3199999999999s)]
*  Camp Richey was designed to be as realistic as possible. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=654.62s)]
*  The Richey boys practiced street fighting in life-size replicas of German villages and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=657.98s)]
*  questioned mock civilians in full-scale German homes. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=663.0600000000001s)]
*  Some of the prisoners were actual German POWs brought to Camp Richey so the Richey boys [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=667.12s)]
*  could practice their interrogation techniques. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=672.08s)]
*  I understand you had sparring partners, you play acted. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=675.34s)]
*  Everyone had to play act with. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=679.46s)]
*  Some of the people were acting as prisoners and some of them were real prisoners. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=681.0s)]
*  By the spring of 1944, the Richey boys were ready to return to Western Europe, this time [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=686.9000000000001s)]
*  as naturalized Americans in American uniforms. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=692.24s)]
*  Still, if they were captured, they knew what the Nazis would do to them. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=696.14s)]
*  Some of them requested new dog tags, with very good reason. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=701.3000000000001s)]
*  This dog tag says Hebrew. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=706.1s)]
*  Did your dog tag identify you as Jewish? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=708.22s)]
*  I preferred not having it. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=710.5s)]
*  I asked them to leave it off. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=713.38s)]
*  You didn't want to be identified as Jewish going back to Western Europe? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=715.3000000000001s)]
*  No, because I knew that the contact with Germans might not be very nice. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=718.26s)]
*  On June 6, 1944, D-Day, the Allies launched one of the most sweeping military operations [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=727.4s)]
*  in history, a mighty onslaught of more than 160,000 men, 13,000 aircraft and 5,000 vessels. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=734.58s)]
*  We were on a PT boat taking off from Southampton and we all were scared. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=743.58s)]
*  We were briefed that the Germans were not going to welcome us greatly. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=751.26s)]
*  As a Jew, I knew I might not be treated exactly by the Geneva rules. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=757.42s)]
*  Divided into six-man teams, the Richey boys were attached to different army units, their [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=764.74s)]
*  job to provide battlefield intelligence. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=769.62s)]
*  When they landed on the beaches of Normandy, Wehrmacht troops were waiting for them, well-armed [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=774.06s)]
*  and well-prepared. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=779.18s)]
*  Victor Brombert was with the 1st American Armor Division to land on Omaha Beach. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=780.9399999999999s)]
*  He's still haunted by what he experienced that day. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=786.2s)]
*  I saw immense debris, wounded people, dead people. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=789.6800000000001s)]
*  I remember being up on the cliff the first night over Omaha Beach and we were strafed [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=796.48s)]
*  and I said to myself, now it's the end because I could feel the machine gun bullets. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=804.12s)]
*  Was that when you first realized, I'm in a war here? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=812.88s)]
*  Yes, I realized that I was afraid. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=816.48s)]
*  I never calculated that there is such a thing as terror, fear. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=819.24s)]
*  So I experienced viscerally fear. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=824.12s)]
*  On the front lines from Normandy onwards, the Richey boys fought in every major battle [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=828.56s)]
*  in Europe, collecting tactical intelligence, interrogating prisoners and civilians, all [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=833.2s)]
*  in service of winning the war. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=838.16s)]
*  When we come back, we'll hear about some of the surprising ways they forged connections [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=840.5s)]
*  with the enemy in order to extract strategic information. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=844.64s)]
*  In 1944, the Richey boys headed to Europe to fight in a war that was for them intensely [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=856.42s)]
*  personal. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=861.66s)]
*  They were members of a secret group whose mastery of the German language and culture [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=862.98s)]
*  helped them provide battlefield intelligence that proved pivotal to the Allies' victory. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=867.68s)]
*  The Richey boys landed on the beaches of Normandy on D-Day and helped liberate Paris. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=872.92s)]
*  They crossed into Germany with the Allied armies and witnessed the horrors of the Nazi [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  concentration camps. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=882.4399999999999s)]
*  All the while, they tracked down evidence and interrogated Nazi criminals later tried [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=884.38s)]
*  at Nuremberg. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=888.68s)]
*  It was also in Europe that some of them, like Guy Stern, learned what had happened to the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=890.16s)]
*  families they left behind. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=894.88s)]
*  By the summer of 1944, German troops in Normandy were outnumbered and overpowered. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=901.08s)]
*  The Allies liberated Paris in August and drove Nazi troops out of France. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=907.04s)]
*  But Hitler was determined to continue the war. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=915.08s)]
*  In the Ardennes region of Belgium, the Germans mounted a massive counteroffensive, which [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=918.22s)]
*  became known as the Battle of the Bulge. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=923.48s)]
*  I see a tent in the background of that photo right in front of you. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=925.88s)]
*  Yes, that's my interrogation tent. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=930.08s)]
*  So this is you on the job. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=932.9200000000001s)]
*  You're in Belgium? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=934.5600000000001s)]
*  You're interrogating. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=935.5600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=936.5600000000001s)]
*  Amid the chaos of war, Guy Stern and the other Richey boys had a job to do. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=937.5600000000001s)]
*  Embedded in every army unit, they interrogated tens of thousands of captured Nazi soldiers, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=944.76s)]
*  as well as civilians, extracting key strategic information on enemy strength, troop movements [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=950.6s)]
*  and defensive positions. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=957.16s)]
*  They then typed up their daily reports in the field to be passed up the chain of command. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=959.44s)]
*  Our interrogations had to do with tactical, immediate concerns. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=964.76s)]
*  And that's why civilians could be useful and soldiers could be useful. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=971.16s)]
*  Where is the minefield? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=975.9200000000001s)]
*  Very important because you save life if you know where the mine... [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=978.24s)]
*  Where is the machine gun nest? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=982.14s)]
*  How many machine guns do you have there? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=985.0s)]
*  Where are your reserve units? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=987.92s)]
*  And if you don't get it from one prisoner, you might get it from the other. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=990.4s)]
*  98-year-old Victor Bromberg says they relied on their Camp Richey training to get people [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=994.6s)]
*  to open up. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=999.76s)]
*  We improvised according to the situation, according to the kind of unit, according to [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1001.12s)]
*  the kind of person we were interrogating. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1007.4000000000001s)]
*  But certainly what did not work was violence or threat of violence. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1010.36s)]
*  Never. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1017.36s)]
*  What did work is complicity. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1019.48s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1023.8000000000001s)]
*  By complicity I mean, oh, we are together in this war, you on one side, we on this side. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1024.8s)]
*  Isn't it a miserable thing? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1030.6000000000001s)]
*  Aren't we all sort of tired of it? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1032.3200000000002s)]
*  With shared experience. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1036.48s)]
*  Shared experience, exactly. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1037.96s)]
*  Giving out some cigarettes also helps a lot. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1039.92s)]
*  A friendly approach, trying to be human. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1043.52s)]
*  The Richey Boys connected with prisoners on subjects as varied as food and soccer rivalries, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1048.16s)]
*  but they weren't above using deception on difficult targets. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1053.72s)]
*  The Richey Boys discovered that the Nazis were terrified of ending up in Russian captivity, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1057.64s)]
*  and they used that to great effect. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1063.2800000000002s)]
*  If a German POW wouldn't talk, he might face Guy Stern, dressed up as a Russian officer. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1066.12s)]
*  I had my whole uniform with medals, Russian medals, and I gave myself the name Commissar [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1072.52s)]
*  Krukow. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1081.56s)]
*  That's what you called yourself? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1082.56s)]
*  It was my pseudonym. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1084.8s)]
*  How did you do Commissar? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1087.68s)]
*  Thank you for asking. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1090.0s)]
*  I gave myself all the accoutrements of looking like a fierce Russian Commissar, and some [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1091.9199999999998s)]
*  we didn't break, but 80% were so darn scared of the Russians and what they would do. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1101.56s)]
*  There's a real element of costumes and deception and accent. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1112.1999999999998s)]
*  Yes, and it's theatrics in a way. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1116.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1122.84s)]
*  Their subjects ranged from low-level German soldiers to high-ranking Nazi officers, including [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1123.84s)]
*  Hans Goebbels, brother of Hitler's chief propagandist, Joseph Goebbels. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1129.6799999999998s)]
*  Another bit of indispensable Richey Boy handiwork, the order of battle of the German army. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1135.8799999999999s)]
*  Paul Fairbrook helped write this compact manual, known as the Red Book, which outlined in great [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1141.8799999999999s)]
*  detail the makeup of virtually every Nazi unit, information every Richey Boy committed [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1147.76s)]
*  to memory. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1153.68s)]
*  When the soldiers said, I'm not going to talk, they could say, wait a minute, I know [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1154.68s)]
*  all about you, look, I got a book here and it tells me that you were here and you were [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1159.52s)]
*  there and your boss was this, and they were impressed with that. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1162.96s)]
*  It sounds like this gave the officers in the field a guide to the German army so they [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1167.78s)]
*  could then interrogate the German POWs more efficiently. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1172.26s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1177.34s)]
*  The Richey Boys earned a reputation for delivering important tactical information fast, making [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1179.1s)]
*  a major contribution to every battle on the Western Front. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1185.18s)]
*  The work they do in the field, being able to glean information simply from the uniform [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1189.42s)]
*  that a captured POW is wearing or the type of weapon that they have or the unit that [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1194.82s)]
*  they've just captured, that information is of critical importance because it tells you [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1201.02s)]
*  where certain units are and if you know where certain units are, you know where the weak [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1206.02s)]
*  spots are, you know where the strong points are and you know what to avoid and what to [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1211.9399999999998s)]
*  attack. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1216.02s)]
*  David Fry teaches history to cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1217.2199999999998s)]
*  This is where having an intelligence officer from Camp Richey is of critical importance [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1223.4s)]
*  because they would know this information. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1228.8000000000002s)]
*  Your average commander in the field might not. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1231.0s)]
*  Their work saved lives? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1234.5600000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1236.2s)]
*  They certainly saved lives. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1237.76s)]
*  I think that that's quantifiable. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1239.0s)]
*  Part of what the Richey Boys did was to convince German units to surrender without fighting. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1240.8400000000001s)]
*  You're saying some of that originated at Camp Richey? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1246.6000000000001s)]
*  Much of it originated at Camp Richey because it hadn't been done before. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1248.84s)]
*  How do you appeal to people in their own language? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1253.84s)]
*  Knowing how to shape that appeal was pretty critical to the success of the mobile broadcast [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1256.52s)]
*  units. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1261.6s)]
*  In trucks equipped with loudspeakers, Richey Boys went to the front lines under heavy fire [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1262.76s)]
*  and tried, in German, to persuade their Nazi counterparts to surrender. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1268.04s)]
*  They also drafted and dropped leaflets from airplanes behind enemy lines. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1273.34s)]
*  This is one of the leaflets that was dropped out of the sky? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1278.22s)]
*  Out of a plane. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1280.66s)]
*  I have some that were shot. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1281.98s)]
*  This one was our most effective leaflet. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1284.5s)]
*  Why was that? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1289.58s)]
*  Because Eisenhower had signed it and the Germans had an incredibly naive approach to everything [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1291.24s)]
*  that was signed and sealed. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1301.46s)]
*  Do you think because it had that signature, somehow that certified it? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1304.78s)]
*  Yes, it carried weight and the belief in the printed matter was very great. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1308.3799999999999s)]
*  That's the kind of thing you would know as a former German who understood the psychology [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1314.6s)]
*  and the mentality. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1319.68s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1320.98s)]
*  Apart from the fighting, there were other threats confronting the Richey Boys. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1322.46s)]
*  Given their foreign accents, they were in particular danger of being mistaken for the [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1326.8s)]
*  enemy by their own troops, who instituted passwords at checkpoints. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1330.94s)]
*  What happened to one of the Richey Boys? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1335.78s)]
*  At night, on the way to the latrine, he was asked for a password. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1338.22s)]
*  He gave the name of the word, the password, but with a German accent. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1341.3s)]
*  He was shot right away and he was killed. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1344.94s)]
*  Did you ever worry your accent might get you killed? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1347.02s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1349.8200000000002s)]
*  I don't talk like an Alabama person or Texan. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1352.3400000000001s)]
*  Some Richey Boys were recruited to go on secret missions during the war. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1357.06s)]
*  97-year-old Max Lerner, an Austrian Jew fluent in German and French, served as a special [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1361.46s)]
*  agent with the Counterintelligence Corps, passing information to French underground [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1367.3s)]
*  resistance groups. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1371.8799999999999s)]
*  You were trained as a spy? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1374.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1375.86s)]
*  What were you trained to do? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1376.86s)]
*  Wear civilian clothes, pass messengers, kill. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1377.86s)]
*  This is going behind enemy lines, this is taking your life in your hands here. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1383.76s)]
*  Well, it was a war. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1389.16s)]
*  That's how you looked at it? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1392.92s)]
*  It was my war and I needed to get my own back. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1394.52s)]
*  I wanted desperately to do something. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1398.72s)]
*  At one point, Max Lerner disguised himself as a German officer and snuck behind enemy [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1402.12s)]
*  lines, leading a team of American soldiers into a German depot at night and destroying [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1406.64s)]
*  the equipment. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1412.3200000000002s)]
*  Did you worry what might happen if you were captured? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1414.0400000000002s)]
*  I wasn't smart enough. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1416.68s)]
*  What do you suspect might have happened? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1418.48s)]
*  Oh, I would have been killed. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1419.92s)]
*  By the spring of 1945, Allied forces neared Berlin and Hitler took his life in his underground [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1422.28s)]
*  bunker. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1428.72s)]
*  Germany surrendered on May 8th of that year. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1430.2s)]
*  What do you remember feeling that day? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1433.16s)]
*  Elated. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1435.5600000000002s)]
*  It was absolutely, we won, kid. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1437.32s)]
*  And those are your comrades? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1444.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1446.04s)]
*  Those are your guys? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1447.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1448.04s)]
*  But joy turned to horror as Allied soldiers, and the world, learned the full scale of the [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1449.04s)]
*  Nazi mass extermination. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1455.12s)]
*  Guy Stern recalled arriving at Buchenwald concentration camp three days after its liberation, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1457.84s)]
*  alongside a fellow American sergeant. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1463.8799999999999s)]
*  We were walking along and you saw these emaciated, horribly looking, close to death people. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1466.76s)]
*  And so I fell back behind because I didn't want to be seen crying to a hardened soldier. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1477.52s)]
*  And then he looked around to look where I was, how I was delayed, and he, this good [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1487.28s)]
*  fellow from middle of Ohio, was bawling just as I was. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1495.48s)]
*  A few days later, Stern returned to the place of his birth, hoping to reunite with his family. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1504.84s)]
*  But Hildesheim was now in ruins. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1511.24s)]
*  A childhood friend described to Stern how his parents, younger brother and sister had [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1514.24s)]
*  been forced from their home and deported. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1518.8000000000002s)]
*  They were killed either in Warsaw or in Auschwitz. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1521.96s)]
*  None of my family survived. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1528.0800000000002s)]
*  I was the only one to get out. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1530.68s)]
*  Did you ever ask yourself why me? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1533.76s)]
*  Why were you the one that made it to the United States? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1535.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1539.72s)]
*  Even last night. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1541.28s)]
*  And I said, well, in slang, there ain't nothing special about you. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1542.3999999999999s)]
*  But if you were saved, you got to show that you were worthy of it. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1551.08s)]
*  And that has been the driving force in my life. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1560.6399999999999s)]
*  It was a way to honor your family that perished. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1564.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1569.3999999999999s)]
*  After the German army's surrender, Guy Stern and the other Richie Boys took on a new assignment, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1571.4s)]

*  Richie Boys were able to identify suspected Nazi war criminals, many of whom later stood [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1589.76s)]

*  The Richie Boys were members of a secret American intelligence group whose mastery of the German [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1600.4s)]
*  language and culture proved critical to the Allies' victory over Hitler. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1612.1200000000001s)]
*  Many of them were Jewish refugees from Europe who fled their homeland, came to America, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1616.96s)]
*  and joined the US Army. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1622.16s)]
*  After Hitler's defeat, many of them took on a challenging new assignment. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1624.1200000000001s)]
*  Using their language and interrogation skills to find and arrest top Nazi war criminals. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1628.56s)]
*  What do you think is the greatest contribution of the Richie Boys? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1635.36s)]
*  I think it was the continuous flow of reliable information that really helped expedite the [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1638.6399999999999s)]
*  end of the war. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1651.52s)]
*  To set a real material impact on World War II. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1652.9199999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1657.04s)]
*  For 99-year-old Guy Stern, a German Jew whose entire family was killed by the Nazis, the [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1658.2s)]
*  Allies' victory over Hitler was the culmination of a public crusade and a private one as well. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1664.44s)]
*  Defeating the Wehrmacht and the Waffennesses and all the fancy troops they had was a satisfaction, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1671.72s)]
*  both as a team member and as a personal satisfaction. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1681.68s)]
*  The very aspect of these SOBs now being at my command give me also some personal satisfaction. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1690.04s)]
*  After Germany's surrender, the Richie Boys took on the difficult task of identifying [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1704.68s)]
*  and tracking down Nazi criminals. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1709.92s)]
*  Longtime Yale and Princeton professor Victor Brombert helped enact the official Allied [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1712.52s)]
*  policy of removing Nazi influence from German public life, known as denazification. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1717.52s)]
*  So in May of 1945, Germany surrenders and you're assigned to the denazification process. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1724.92s)]
*  What did that entail? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1732.24s)]
*  We were supposed to arrest important Nazi officials, not just any Nazi party member. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1733.72s)]
*  It was very, very hard, very difficult, very rare to have a German denounce another German [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1741.68s)]
*  at that point. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1749.56s)]
*  Now is it because they were afraid that the Nazis might come back, that it's not over? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1752.6s)]
*  Or is it just a habit or habit of obedience or dignity? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1757.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1762.3999999999999s)]
*  And at great effort we found people, we arrested them, we were proud of doing that. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1763.8799999999999s)]
*  As part of denazification, photos of Nazi atrocities were posted in German shop windows [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1769.8799999999999s)]
*  and Richie Boys led the country's citizens on tours of the concentration camps to educate [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1776.08s)]
*  the local population about the evil Hitler had perpetrated. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1781.8s)]
*  Sometimes entire German towns were forced to pay respects to the dead. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1786.6s)]
*  Max Lerner was assigned to interview German civilians to help gauge the degree to which [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1791.32s)]
*  they had served the Nazi cause and determine which ones should be punished. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1796.2s)]
*  I imagine all of a sudden no one wants to admit to being a Nazi. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1801.56s)]
*  There were no Nazis. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1804.84s)]
*  They were all forced to. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1805.84s)]
*  So that's what you were told. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1808.32s)]
*  I'm denouncing this and I was forced to do it. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1809.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1811.6799999999998s)]
*  They were all justifying themselves. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1812.6799999999998s)]
*  It was a terrible situation and I had no choice. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1815.8799999999999s)]
*  I had no choice. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1819.84s)]
*  That was the mantra. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1821.68s)]
*  I would have been killed if I hadn't gone along. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1822.68s)]
*  Did you ever confront a Nazi who said this was morally reprehensible? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1826.64s)]
*  No. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1831.04s)]
*  Unprincipled and dishonorable and I'm sorry. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1832.04s)]
*  No. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1834.56s)]
*  Never? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1835.56s)]
*  Never. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1836.56s)]
*  One of the ways they identified subjects wanted for interrogation was by consulting this book, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1838.52s)]
*  the Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects, which listed enemy nationals [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1843.92s)]
*  suspected of committing tens of thousands of war crimes in Europe, everyone from low-ranking [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1849.6000000000001s)]
*  members of the armed forces to top Nazi officials. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1855.44s)]
*  To allied investigators, it became a sort of Nazi hunter's bible. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1859.6000000000001s)]
*  Did you enjoy hunting Nazis? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1864.3600000000001s)]
*  Did it give you any satisfaction? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1866.48s)]
*  It gave me a great deal of satisfaction. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1868.2s)]
*  Joy is perhaps not the right word but it gave me a great deal of satisfaction. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1871.6s)]
*  Why specifically? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1876.76s)]
*  Because I remembered my parents. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1878.76s)]
*  My father was 49 years old, my mother was 48 and they left everything they had built [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1881.24s)]
*  up behind and arrived in the United States penniless. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1887.6399999999999s)]
*  And you were able to confront the people that had caused this trauma? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1892.9199999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1898.1999999999998s)]
*  All SS members were subject to automatic arrest. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1900.36s)]
*  Established by Hitler and led by Heinrich Himmler, the SS was responsible for security [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1904.1999999999998s)]
*  and intelligence collection in Germany. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1910.04s)]
*  The SS controlled the German police forces and concentration camps and directed the so-called [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1913.0s)]
*  Final Solution to kill all European Jews. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1918.7199999999998s)]
*  Max Lerner recalls that, in one respect at least, identifying most SS members was easy. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1923.08s)]
*  You know how to tell an SS man. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1929.88s)]
*  How? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1932.8000000000002s)]
*  They have a tattoo of their blood group under their left arms. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1933.8000000000002s)]
*  SS men you're saying have a tattoo under their left arm with their blood type? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1940.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1944.5200000000002s)]
*  Or they had an effort to erase it. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1945.5200000000002s)]
*  The purpose of the tattoo was to identify a soldier's blood type in case a transfusion [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1949.64s)]
*  was needed or if his dog tags went missing. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1954.8000000000002s)]
*  Max Lerner recalls being put in charge of one prominent captured German prisoner at [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1958.76s)]
*  a jail and V-spot in Germany. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1963.28s)]
*  That was Julius Streicher, the founder and editor of the Nazi paper Der Stürmer and [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1965.86s)]
*  one of the country's leading anti-Semites. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1971.48s)]
*  He spent several days in my jail and I made sure he knew that it was a Jew who controlled [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1973.56s)]
*  him. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1982.24s)]
*  You let him know you were Jewish? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1983.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh yes. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1984.8799999999999s)]
*  Streicher was later tried and convicted at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1987.88s)]
*  where concentration camp survivors who bore witness to the mass murder faced down their [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1993.5200000000002s)]
*  Nazi tormentors. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=1998.7600000000002s)]
*  Dozens of Richie Boys worked at the Nuremberg trials as prosecutors, interrogators and translators. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2001.0400000000002s)]
*  Richie Boys also collected evidence which led to the prosecution of many high-ranking [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2007.64s)]
*  Nazis including Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, Rudolf Hess, deputy furor to [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2012.04s)]

*  After the war, Guy Stern and the other Richie Boys were celebrated for their achievements. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2035.6599999999999s)]
*  The Bronze Star was given to me right at the end of hostilities. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2041.56s)]
*  This is a good conduct medal, which I'm not really entitled to, and this year is the European [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2048.88s)]

*  God no. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2067.72s)]
*  I tell you, when we landed on Omaha Beach, the whole heights had been occupied by the [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2070.22s)]

*  And to take those heights against heavy firing, going up those steep cliffs, and of course [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2102.36s)]
*  it had been done. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2112.08s)]

*  Did the Richie Boys redefine what it means to be a soldier and contribute to a military? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2132.5s)]
*  I think they did because they served in so many different capacities. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2137.82s)]

*  documents. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2225.56s)]
*  The project detailed every aspect of the German Army's operations during the war, including [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2227.02s)]
*  how they were structured, how they mobilized, and how they used intelligence. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2232.1s)]
*  The U.S. War Department used this collection of German documents to study Germany's battles [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2236.98s)]
*  with the Soviets on the Eastern Front in order to be better prepared for any future conflict [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2241.98s)]

*  Maryland. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2254.34s)]
*  It's not only that short-term impact on the battlefield, it was an impact on war crimes, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2255.34s)]
*  then shaping the Cold War era. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2262.08s)]

*  After the war, Guy Stern, Victor Brombert, Paul Fairbrook, and Max Lerner came home, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2266.2400000000002s)]

*  They all rose to the top of their fields, as did a number of other Richie Boys. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2279.34s)]
*  I understand there's some Richie Boys became fairly prominent figures. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2284.24s)]
*  There are a whole variety of prominent Richie Boys. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2289.3999999999996s)]
*  It turns out that author J.D. Salinger was a Richie Boy. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2292.4599999999996s)]
*  So was Archibald Roosevelt, grandson of Theodore Roosevelt, as was philanthropist David Rockefeller [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2296.4199999999996s)]
*  and media baron and billionaire John Kluge. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2303.2799999999997s)]
*  Some became ambassadors. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2307.06s)]
*  Others were actually really important in American science. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2308.66s)]
*  Innotably, Professor Fry says, more than 250 Richie Boys continued to work in the field [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2312.84s)]
*  of intelligence after the war, becoming professional spies. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2318.7200000000003s)]
*  Many of those who trained at Camp Richie actually did go on to the OSS, the precursor to the [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2323.5s)]
*  CIA. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2329.98s)]
*  That meant that the people who learned their craft at Camp Richie played a significant [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2330.98s)]
*  role in setting up what eventually became the CIA. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2335.0400000000004s)]
*  How do you think we should be recalling the Richie Boys? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2340.24s)]
*  I think we look at this group and we see true heroes. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2343.58s)]
*  We see those who are the greatest of the greatest generation. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2346.64s)]
*  These are people who made massive contributions, who helped shape what it meant to be American [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2350.08s)]
*  and who, in some cases, gave their lives in service to this country. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2356.4599999999996s)]
*  This is a remarkable story. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2360.62s)]
*  Why do so few Americans know about this? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2364.2s)]
*  As it involves military intelligence, much of it was actually kept secret until the 1990s. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2367.0s)]
*  A lot of what was learned and the methods used are important to keep secret. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2373.76s)]
*  Only in the early 2000s did we begin to see reunions of the Richie Boys. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2380.78s)]
*  Now in their late 90s, these humble warriors still keep in touch, swapping stories about [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2386.56s)]
*  a chapter in American history now finally being told. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2392.9s)]
*  What is it like when you get together and reflect on this experience going on 80 years [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2398.2200000000003s)]

*  You have a smile on your face when you think back. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2408.7400000000002s)]
*  Yes, this is what happens. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2411.3s)]
*  It was hard for us not to notice that beyond the stories runs a deep sense of pride. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2414.14s)]
*  You bet your life I'm proud of the Richie Boys. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2421.3s)]
*  It was wonderful to be part of them. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2423.7400000000002s)]
*  I was proud to be in the American Army. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2426.46s)]
*  We were able to do what we had to do. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2429.38s)]
*  I don't think we're heroes, but the opportunity to help fight and win the war was a wonderful [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2431.46s)]
*  way. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2438.78s)]
*  I can look anybody straight in the eye and I said, I think I've earned the right to be [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2439.78s)]
*  an American. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2443.6600000000003s)]

*  Most of us learned in history class about the critical World War II chapters in the [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2451.3s)]
*  fight against Japan. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2461.38s)]

*  But who among us learned about Attu, site of the only ground campaign waged in North [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2466.0600000000004s)]
*  America during the entire war, and a surpassingly brutal battle at that? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2470.96s)]
*  Perhaps it's because Attu is the westernmost point of the United States, the last jeweled [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2476.1800000000003s)]
*  in Alaska's necklace of Aleutian Islands. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2481.02s)]
*  Perhaps it's because Attu's weather is so combative, the island might be as difficult [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2483.98s)]
*  to reach as anywhere on the planet. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2488.3s)]
*  But while the fight for Attu has been exiled to the smallest of military footnotes, a new [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2491.22s)]
*  book to be published this week by Simon & Schuster, a CBS company, tells the story of how 76 years [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2496.06s)]

*  impossibly remote island of Attu. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2509.58s)]
*  We set out in search of history, flying across the volcanic chain of Alaska's Aleutian Islands. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2514.7000000000003s)]
*  Our destination? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2520.78s)]
*  Attu. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2521.78s)]
*  Two plane stops and 1,500 miles from Anchorage, Attu is so far west that if you drew a straight [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2522.78s)]
*  line down from the island, you'd hit New Zealand. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2529.78s)]
*  We had taken off not knowing if our plane could land on Attu. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2534.1800000000003s)]
*  Attu is home to some of the worst weather on Earth. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2538.42s)]
*  There's only eight days a year when the clouds and fog lift. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2540.1400000000003s)]
*  Marco Massac, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, spent seven years going through archives and [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2545.7400000000002s)]

*  Only minutes from the island, a dense fog threatened to force our plane back to the [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2559.7400000000002s)]
*  nearest airstrip 400 miles away. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2564.26s)]
*  Then the fog suddenly parted like curtains. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2568.62s)]
*  And there it was, Attu. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2571.62s)]
*  So when you finally got there, what was that like? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2574.62s)]
*  It was so gorgeous. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2578.34s)]
*  It was so green and wild and raw. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2579.66s)]
*  No one lives on Attu today. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2584.38s)]
*  The Coast Guard abandoned its station and the island nine years ago. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2586.58s)]
*  I just was struck by how such a beautiful place could spawn such sadness. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2591.46s)]
*  The first Japanese attack on the island's island business began in June of 1942. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2597.94s)]
*  The Japanese strike. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2602.94s)]
*  Six months after Pearl Harbor, 2,600 Japanese soldiers invaded Attu, populated then by 42 [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2604.94s)]
*  Aleut natives, a school teacher and her husband. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2612.94s)]
*  The Japanese arrive in 1942. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2616.94s)]
*  Are they expecting any resistance? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2618.94s)]
*  Well, they didn't find it. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2620.94s)]
*  They could have taken the island with the bullhorn. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2621.94s)]
*  Nobody on that island was armed. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2623.94s)]
*  They could use Attu as a launching pad to attack the west coast of the United States. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2626.42s)]
*  Attu was the first U.S. soil lost since the War of 1812. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2631.42s)]
*  So it was a propaganda victory for the Japanese. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2636.42s)]
*  But one Japanese soldier was conflicted. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2640.42s)]
*  Nobuo Tatsuguchi had lived for 10 years in America, finishing medical school in California. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2643.42s)]
*  He called himself Paul. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2649.42s)]
*  Paul Tatsuguchi fell in love with America. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2651.42s)]
*  He came over from Japan. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2654.9s)]
*  He proposed to her at Yosemite National Park for their honeymoon. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2655.9s)]
*  They went from Los Angeles to Niagara Falls on a Greyhound bus. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2658.9s)]
*  Quintessentially American. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2662.9s)]
*  You can't get more American than that. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2663.9s)]
*  Paul Tatsuguchi loved America's open roads, its skyscrapers and its ice cream. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2665.9s)]
*  But in 1941, he was conscripted into the Japanese Army. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2672.9s)]
*  He was a devout Christian and a pacifist forced into war. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2676.9s)]
*  He brought his Bible to Attu. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2680.9s)]
*  Paul Tatsuguchi's favorite Bible verse came right out of Deuteronomy. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2683.38s)]

*  As chill winds whipped through Attu, the Japanese took to the mountains, digging foxholes and [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2690.38s)]
*  storing ammunition in sheds that can still be found on Attu today. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2696.38s)]
*  As a medic, Tatsuguchi hunkered down in a makeshift hospital in what's called the Jarman Pass, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2701.38s)]
*  waiting for the inevitable American counter-invasion. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2707.38s)]
*  In May 1943, 11,000 Americans were sent north to recapture this far-flung outpost of the [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2710.86s)]
*  United States, riding on one of the boats, Private Harry Sasser. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2718.86s)]
*  What he heard about Attu sounded ominous. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2723.86s)]
*  It was treacherous weather. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2726.86s)]
*  Storms came up just suddenly. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2728.86s)]
*  I mean in seconds. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2731.86s)]
*  Sasser is now 96, but back then he was a Mississippi boy, assured he wouldn't be on Attu for long. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2733.86s)]
*  We were told it would be about three days and that would be it, but that wasn't the [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2740.34s)]
*  case. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2745.34s)]
*  The Japanese were very tenacious fighters. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2746.34s)]
*  The primary force of U.S. troops landed on this beach. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2750.34s)]
*  So U.S. troops land on the shore, your adrenaline's pumping, you're expecting to be shot, and [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2753.34s)]
*  instead, nothing. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2758.34s)]
*  All they find is black muck. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2760.34s)]
*  Black muck. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2763.34s)]
*  It seemed to swallow the troops on the beach with every slogging step. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2765.34s)]
*  The Japanese were hiding in the mountain fog. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2769.82s)]
*  There are snipers waiting to pick off the Americans once they crawled up the valley. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2771.82s)]
*  The Japanese would follow the fog up and down. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2776.82s)]
*  For U.S. servicemen, they said it was like trying to shoot birds out of a cloud. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2779.82s)]
*  Paul Tatsaguchi began writing a diary. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2784.82s)]
*  On the second day of the battle, he noted, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2787.82s)]
*  Took care of patience during bombardment. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2789.82s)]
*  Our desperate defense is holding up well. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2792.82s)]
*  But the Americans' 4-to-1 advantage in troops eventually exacted a toll. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2796.3s)]
*  And by May 29, three weeks into the battle, the Japanese were doomed. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2801.3s)]
*  And so the Japanese commander organizes a final Banzai attack. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2806.3s)]
*  And Paul Tatsaguchi sits down at his diary and writes his final entry. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2810.3s)]
*  Goodbye, Taeko, my beloved wife who loved me to the last. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2818.3s)]
*  And then he bid farewell to his daughters, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2823.78s)]
*  his younger one, born February of this year and gone without seeing your father. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2825.78s)]
*  Hours after writing those words, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2831.78s)]
*  Paul Tatsaguchi left his Bible behind and advanced to an outcrop overlooking a small lake. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2833.78s)]
*  Below were unsuspecting American soldiers like Dick Laird, an Army Sergeant from Appalachia. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2839.78s)]
*  Dick Laird was a tough guy, but all the American training was that [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2845.78s)]
*  Japanese troops were bloodthirsty killing machines. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2850.26s)]
*  And how did Dick Laird and Paul Tatsaguchi, how did they collide? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2854.26s)]
*  Dick Laird looks up the knoll and sees that a group of Japanese soldiers [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2857.26s)]
*  has captured an American mortar. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2863.26s)]
*  And so Laird pulls out two grenades. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2866.26s)]
*  He pulls the pin and then he throws it. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2868.26s)]
*  The grenade explodes and Laird finds that some troops were alive. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2871.26s)]
*  And he and a fellow soldier kill them. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2875.26s)]
*  He kills eight Japanese men. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2879.7400000000002s)]
*  He does. And he wins the Silver Star for it. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2880.7400000000002s)]
*  On one of them he notices something unusual. What was that? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2882.7400000000002s)]
*  There is an address book that's full of some names from California. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2885.7400000000002s)]
*  And there is a sheet, the diary. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2890.7400000000002s)]
*  Whose personal effects were those? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2894.7400000000002s)]
*  He found the diary of Paul Tatsaguchi, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2896.7400000000002s)]
*  whom he had killed as Tatsaguchi was joining the Banzai attack. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2899.7400000000002s)]
*  The Banzai attack and the Japanese occupation of Attu [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2905.22s)]
*  came to an end later that day, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2909.22s)]
*  when 500 defeated Japanese soldiers gathered on this hill. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2911.22s)]
*  Harry Sasser witnessed the mass suicide. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2916.22s)]
*  They pulled the trigger on the hand grenade and just blew the stomach out. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2919.22s)]
*  A gruesome scene. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2927.22s)]
*  It was. Oh, it was. It was. It was tough. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2928.22s)]
*  The code was death before dishonor. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2932.7s)]
*  And of more than 2,600 Japanese men who started, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2935.7s)]
*  only 28 survived. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2939.7s)]
*  28. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2942.7s)]
*  The only battle in the war in the Pacific that had a worse casualty rate [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2943.7s)]
*  was at Iwo Jima. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2947.7s)]
*  549 Americans were killed on Attu. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2949.7s)]
*  More than 3,000 were wounded or suffered weather-related injuries. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2953.7s)]
*  Dick Laird survived. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2957.7s)]
*  He turned over Paul Tatsaguchi's diary to superiors. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2960.18s)]
*  Instead of containing military secrets, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2963.18s)]
*  the diary contained human sentiments. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2966.18s)]
*  So much so, English translations began circulating. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2969.18s)]
*  Harry Sasser read a copy in Mississippi. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2972.18s)]
*  Well, it was a compelling account. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2975.18s)]
*  And as he bid farewell to his wife and to his daughter, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2978.18s)]
*  I sympathized with him. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2983.18s)]
*  What was Dick Laird's reaction to reading the diary? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2988.66s)]
*  Crestfallen. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2990.66s)]
*  But angry. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2991.66s)]
*  Because Tatsaguchi was one of the eight guys who had captured the mortar [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2992.66s)]
*  and he were going to try to kill him. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2996.66s)]
*  But at the same time, Laird could see that Tatsaguchi loved his family [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=2998.66s)]
*  and that he was human. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3003.66s)]
*  Dick Laird never forgot about May 29, 1943. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3004.66s)]
*  Dick Laird did not. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3008.66s)]
*  He suffered nightmares for years. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3009.66s)]
*  He just kept coming back thinking that I killed a guy who shouldn't have been there. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3012.66s)]
*  You know, I killed a father. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3018.14s)]
*  41 years after Dick Laird had fought on Attu, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3021.14s)]
*  he pulled up to this home in Sherman Oaks, California, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3025.14s)]
*  in the spring of 1984. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3028.14s)]
*  Did he seem nervous? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3031.14s)]
*  Yes, he seemed nervous. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3032.14s)]
*  This is Laura Tatsaguchi Davis, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3034.14s)]
*  the younger daughter Paul had never met. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3037.14s)]
*  After the war, she moved with her mother to the place her father loved, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3040.14s)]
*  Southern California. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3044.14s)]
*  Laura didn't quite understand why Dick Laird showed up. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3045.62s)]
*  He didn't tell me anything until I walked him out. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3049.62s)]
*  And when we walked out, he said, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3053.62s)]
*  I'm the one that killed your father. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3055.62s)]
*  And he just drove off. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3058.62s)]
*  And I was in a daze. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3061.62s)]
*  You were in shock? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3064.62s)]
*  Totally in shock. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3065.62s)]
*  Did you have anger or resentment towards Mr. Laird? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3066.62s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3070.62s)]
*  Laird had left his phone number with Laura, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3072.1s)]
*  but she refused to reach out. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3075.1s)]
*  A decade later, another American veteran of Attu tracked down Laura. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3077.1s)]
*  Alvin Keppi of Michigan wrote this letter. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3082.1s)]
*  He wanted to return something he had found in 1943 [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3085.1s)]
*  on Attu's Jarman Pass. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3089.1s)]
*  This is the Bible that was found by the Jarman Pass. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3091.1s)]
*  This is the Bible your father took to war? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3097.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3100.1s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3101.58s)]
*  And he writes in the very first page of the Bible, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3102.58s)]
*  Therefore, choose life. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3107.58s)]
*  Therefore, choose life. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3109.58s)]
*  Therefore, choose life. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3111.58s)]
*  This is the Bible that gave him strength when he won off to war. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3112.58s)]
*  I think so. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3117.58s)]
*  What's it like for you holding that? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3118.58s)]
*  It gives me strength. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3120.58s)]
*  The Bible is now housed at the Japanese American Museum in L.A. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3123.58s)]
*  Tucked inside the Bible are reminders of what Paul Tatsaguchi lost. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3128.06s)]
*  And there's a picture of my sister. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3132.06s)]
*  She was almost three, and I was three months, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3134.06s)]
*  and he had not seen me. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3137.06s)]
*  If this Bible could talk. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3139.06s)]
*  Yeah, I wish it could. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3141.06s)]
*  For years, Laura wondered why Dick Laird had been so determined [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3143.06s)]
*  to reveal that he had killed her father. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3148.06s)]
*  Then it came to her. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3151.06s)]
*  I wrote to him saying, please forgive yourself. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3153.54s)]
*  What made you do that? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3158.54s)]
*  I started thinking. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3159.54s)]
*  I said, this man did not belong and ought to just as much as my father. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3161.54s)]
*  He was protecting his country. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3172.54s)]
*  He had to protect himself. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3175.54s)]
*  You wrote to him, none of you should have been there, but you were. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3177.54s)]
*  And that fact cast upon you terrible duties, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3182.02s)]
*  duties you discharged the only way you could. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3184.02s)]
*  What happened happened. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3187.02s)]
*  You were not at fault. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3189.02s)]
*  He was not. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3191.02s)]
*  You wanted to free him. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3193.02s)]
*  And I was the only one that could. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3195.02s)]
*  Laird said that he read the letter and he cried. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3197.02s)]
*  And he said it was the first time in a long time that he slept without nightmares. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3200.02s)]
*  And most improbably, Laura and Dick Laird became friends, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3207.02s)]
*  meeting often in Tucson where her son attended school and Dick Laird had retired. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3211.5s)]
*  He said, I killed the wrong man. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3216.5s)]
*  You know, this is how he felt. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3219.5s)]
*  Was it almost like he felt he killed another American? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3222.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3225.5s)]
*  Dick Laird died in 2005. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3227.5s)]
*  As for Paul Tatsaguchi, near the spot where he was killed on Attu, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3230.5s)]
*  a monument to peace was erected by the Japanese government. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3234.5s)]
*  Signs of the American presence still abound. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3241.5s)]
*  So do signs of a battle lost to the rust of history. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3244.5s)]
*  Attu's been left to the snowy owls and to the ghostly winds that will go unheard. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3248.5s)]
*  It's well known the French government collaborated with the Nazis during World War II, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3255.98s)]
*  helping send tens of thousands of Jews to their deaths. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3260.98s)]
*  What's less well known are the heroic efforts by members of underground resistance groups [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3264.98s)]
*  to save Jews and friends. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3269.98s)]
*  The French government is known for its efforts to save the lives of thousands of people [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3271.98s)]
*  who were killed in the war. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3276.98s)]
*  But the French government is not the only one who has been able to do so. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3278.98s)]
*  Many of those who risked their lives are now gone or have been reluctant to share their stories. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3283.46s)]
*  Tonight you'll hear from 92-year-old Adolfo Kaminski, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3288.46s)]
*  who was a Jewish teenager when he joined the French resistance. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3292.46s)]
*  He had a unique talent he'd picked up while working at a dry cleaners, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3296.46s)]
*  an expertise that helped him become one of the greatest forgers in France during the war. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3300.46s)]
*  Incredibly, he and the resistance networks he worked with [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3306.46s)]
*  created fake identity documents that helped save the lives of as many as 14,000 Jewish men, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3309.94s)]
*  women and children. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3314.94s)]
*  June 1940, Hitler smashed through the western defenses and overran France. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3316.94s)]
*  Hitler's army entered Paris with a massive show of force. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3322.94s)]
*  German troops marched past the Arc de Triomphe and raised the Nazi war flag over a stunned city. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3326.94s)]
*  Hitler personally attended the march. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3332.94s)]
*  The Nazis took control of Paris, but relied on French authorities and police [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3336.42s)]
*  to begin to identify Jews and round them up. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3341.42s)]
*  As part of Hitler's final solution, tens of thousands of Jews and others targeted by the Nazis in France [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3344.42s)]
*  were arrested and loaded onto trains bound for Auschwitz and other concentration camps. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3351.42s)]
*  French resistance networks tried to get the Jews to leave the city, but they failed. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3357.42s)]
*  French resistance networks tried to save as many Jews as possible, especially children, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3362.9s)]
*  giving them fake identity papers and smuggling them across the border [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3368.9s)]
*  or hiding them in farms, schools and convents in France. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3372.9s)]
*  Adolfo Kaminski was just 18 when he began to work as a forger for the resistance. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3376.9s)]
*  We had to move very quickly and help these people disappear before they were arrested. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3384.9s)]
*  So it was just racing against the clock and actually I called it racing against death. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3390.38s)]
*  That's what you were doing? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3395.38s)]
*  Yes, day and night. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3397.38s)]
*  Kaminski still has some of the fake documents he made, identity cards, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3400.38s)]
*  passports, food ration cards and birth and marriage certificates. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3405.38s)]
*  This is one that was fabricated. This is one that was made for this person. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3410.38s)]
*  So this is your work? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3416.38s)]
*  This is fake. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3418.86s)]
*  That's all my work. It's all false. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3419.86s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3422.86s)]
*  Oh yes, that's my writing, everything. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3424.86s)]
*  Jewish sounding names had to be replaced with more French sounding ones [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3427.86s)]
*  and the word Jew had to be somehow erased. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3431.86s)]
*  Wow, look at that. That's incredible. What is that? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3434.86s)]
*  That is a real one. That is a model we would use. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3437.86s)]
*  So this stamp, this word, Jouif, was the difference between life and death for some people? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3440.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3447.34s)]
*  Having Jew stamped on anything meant you were in danger. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3449.34s)]
*  Two of the Jewish children who were saved by the resistance network [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3453.34s)]
*  Kaminski worked for are Edith Mayer and Sarah Miller. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3457.34s)]
*  Edith was 15 when she was forced into hiding after her father and brother were sent to Auschwitz. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3461.34s)]
*  What sort of documents did you need in order to be able to live? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3467.34s)]
*  Well, in France at the time you were nothing if you didn't have ID. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3470.34s)]
*  So I had to have a birth certificate and I had to have a carte d'identité, an identity card. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3473.82s)]
*  She showed us a copy of the fake birth certificate that saved her life. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3479.82s)]
*  They gave you a new name. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3483.82s)]
*  They gave me a new name. So instead of Edith Mayer I became Elise Mayer, which sounds more French. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3485.82s)]
*  And my fake father was Jules Mayer and my fake mother was Eliane Marie Chauvin. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3490.82s)]
*  It was critical that the papers be absolutely correct. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3498.82s)]
*  If the forger made a mistake. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3503.3s)]
*  Yeah, you were done for. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3506.3s)]
*  Sarah Miller used her fake papers to get a job when she was 16, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3508.3s)]
*  hiding in plain sight, working as a salesgirl in a store frequented by Nazi troops. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3512.3s)]
*  You were interacting with German soldiers all the time at work. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3518.3s)]
*  I tried my best to speak as little as possible. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3521.3s)]
*  Obviously if they had known you were Jewish. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3524.3s)]
*  Believe me, they would have come and picked me up and sent me to the camp. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3527.3s)]
*  That was sure. But they didn't know. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3531.78s)]
*  When was the last time you came back here? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3533.78s)]
*  Adolfo Kaminski took us to the street where he ran his secret lab right under the nose of the Nazis. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3536.78s)]
*  It was located in a narrow attic room in the center of Paris, just blocks from the Cathedral of Notre Dame. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3542.78s)]
*  There Kaminski and three others used chemicals and other tools of the forging trade to create and alter documents. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3549.78s)]
*  All the while avoiding detection by pretending they were artists. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3558.26s)]
*  The neighbors thought we were painters. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3565.26s)]
*  We had paintings on the walls and paint brushes and all kinds of colors. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3567.26s)]
*  Using everyday items like this sewing machine he still has, he created perforations and stamps. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3574.26s)]
*  He salvaged metal from junk shops and used wood blocks and inks to create rubber stamps. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3580.26s)]
*  He also manufactured paper and reproduced watermarks, letterheads and official signatures. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3585.7400000000002s)]
*  You could make the document and the signature but also the stamp and even the raised watermark? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3591.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh yes, of course. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3595.7400000000002s)]
*  And the pipe? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3597.7400000000002s)]
*  The pipe was to print with this. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3599.7400000000002s)]
*  So you would apply the ink and you would put a piece of paper there and then there you go. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3602.7400000000002s)]
*  And just do this. It was perfect. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3610.7400000000002s)]
*  His secret lab would become one of the biggest suppliers of forged documents for Jews in France, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3613.22s)]
*  producing, he says, as many as 500 a week. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3618.22s)]
*  One of the people who worked with him is 93-year-old Susie Shidloff. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3623.22s)]
*  We met her in a small town near Bordeaux where she has an art studio. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3627.22s)]
*  Was he a great forger? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3632.22s)]
*  He did incredible things. He had a sort of genius. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3634.22s)]
*  First to find very simple answers to problems and also to learn things that other people learned years to learn in a few days. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3639.7s)]
*  Shidloff was 19 years old and a fine art student when she joined the resistance with her sister Herta. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3653.7s)]
*  She says they spent such long hours in the clandestine lab with Kaminsky that she often fell asleep at her workstation. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3659.7s)]
*  In the lab, what was your job? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3666.7s)]
*  Everything which has to do with drawing, with imitating handwriting. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3669.18s)]
*  She also drew stamps, or in many cases partial stamps because they looked more realistic. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3675.18s)]
*  Like somebody had just stamped quickly. That sounds difficult. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3681.18s)]
*  No, it's art. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3684.18s)]
*  It's amazing when you think back to how young you all were and how brave. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3687.18s)]
*  I think it's much easier not to be afraid when you are very young. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3692.18s)]
*  They all knew the risks, but Shidloff says Kaminsky in particular was determined to take them. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3697.66s)]
*  He so fits with his character. He could not stand people being oppressed and not being free. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3703.66s)]
*  And false papers give you the freedom. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3710.66s)]
*  Nobody knew that better than Adolfo Kaminsky. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3713.66s)]
*  When he was 18, his family was arrested and sent here to Drancy, a concentration camp in the suburbs of Paris. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3716.66s)]
*  Miraculously, after three months, they were released. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3725.14s)]
*  Though they were Jewish, they had Argentinian citizenship, and at the time Argentina was neutral in the war. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3728.14s)]
*  But in Drancy, Adolfo witnessed countless others being put on trains and sent to Auschwitz. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3735.14s)]
*  For three months, every week, I saw a thousand people be deported. It was horrible suffering. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3742.14s)]
*  When you saw people going onto trains, did you know what it meant? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3748.14s)]
*  Yes, we knew. In fact, everyone knew deep down. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3753.62s)]
*  There were some people who didn't want to believe it, but everyone knew. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3757.62s)]
*  There was just a huge, unimaginable quantity of people murdered. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3762.62s)]
*  Were there German soldiers everywhere? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3767.62s)]
*  After being released from Drancy, Kaminsky's father decided the family should split up and adopt false identities. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3770.62s)]
*  He sent Adolfo to pick up their new papers from a member of the resistance. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3776.62s)]
*  That fateful meeting took place here in front of the Sorbonne University. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3782.1s)]
*  When the man from the resistance learned that Kaminsky had worked at a dry cleaners and knew how to remove stains, he got excited. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3787.1s)]
*  And he said, dry cleaner? Do you know how to work with colors? And do you know how to bleach ink? And I said, yes. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3794.1s)]
*  The resistance had been desperately trying to figure out how to erase a permanent blue ink from official documents. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3801.1s)]
*  Adolfo Kaminsky knew the chemical that could do the trick, lactic acid. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3808.58s)]
*  When you realized lactic acid could work to remove this blue ink, how important was that? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3812.58s)]
*  It was very important because that enabled us to use existing identity documents, existing papers that were real, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3820.58s)]
*  and you could erase things from them without leaving any trace. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3827.58s)]
*  It was at that meeting that Adolfo Kaminsky decided to join the resistance. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3832.58s)]
*  When he asked you to join, you weren't frightened? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3838.06s)]
*  Afraid of what? Afraid of what? The risk was the same if you did nothing. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3841.06s)]
*  So at least working in the resistance, I could fight. I was fighting for humanity. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3846.06s)]
*  When you realized what he had done during World War II, what did you think? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3852.06s)]
*  I was amazed. I was amazed. I didn't understand why he didn't want to talk about it. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3857.06s)]
*  Adolfo Kaminsky's daughter, Sarah, says she first heard about her father's heroic work when she was in high school, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3862.54s)]
*  but it took years before he could talk with her about the horrors of the occupation [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3870.54s)]
*  and the memories of trying to save people from being deported to concentration camps. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3875.54s)]
*  He still feels guilty. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3880.54s)]
*  That he survived and the others didn't? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3882.54s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3884.54s)]
*  If I couldn't have saved so many people, I wouldn't have survived myself. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3886.02s)]
*  Most of my friends who were survivors ended up committing suicide. It's just really tough. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3892.02s)]
*  So many people were treated like animals with no respect. It's just really hard to bear. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3900.02s)]
*  By saving others, you saved yourself? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3906.02s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3908.02s)]
*  Sarah Kaminsky wrote a book about her father. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3911.02s)]
*  And they share his story with high school students throughout France. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3914.5s)]
*  Do you feel like you know your father now? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3918.5s)]
*  I do. Now, yes. Yes, I do. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3920.5s)]
*  And you're proud of him? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3923.5s)]
*  I'm very proud of him. Very. I'm always asking myself what would I have done. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3924.5s)]
*  If you were in his shoes? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3933.5s)]
*  Yes. I'm sure that I would not have had his courage. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3934.5s)]
*  There's not many people who would have. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3939.5s)]
*  Yes, I'm sure of that. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3941.98s)]
*  What I like in his story is that a few people can make a difference in front of big armies. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3943.98s)]
*  So it gives a lot of hope, I think. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3951.98s)]
*  In all, 76,000 Jews in France were sent to death camps during the war. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3956.98s)]
*  Only about 2,500 of them survived. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3961.98s)]
*  Edith Mayer and Sarah Miller, who went into hiding, eventually were smuggled into Switzerland. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3965.46s)]
*  To this day, they don't know if it was Adolfo Kaminsky or one of his colleagues who made their false papers. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3971.46s)]
*  What would you say to Adolfo Kaminsky or to the other forgers? [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3978.46s)]
*  They have my eternal gratitude. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3983.46s)]
*  They saved your life? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3985.46s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. Without papers, you were as good as dead. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3987.46s)]
*  Absolutely, I agree with them. They saved my life. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3991.94s)]
*  Kaminsky was awarded the Medal of the Resistance after the war, along with a stack of other medals. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=3995.94s)]
*  But he doesn't like to display them. He keeps them in a suitcase under his bed. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4001.94s)]
*  Wow. That's a big one. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4006.94s)]
*  Yes, Grenoble. They say I saved how many people was it? 1500? 3000 Jewish children? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4008.94s)]
*  You never take them out even to look at them? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4017.94s)]
*  No, you know, I've seen them. They don't change. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4021.42s)]
*  Were you one of the best forgers? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4027.42s)]
*  Now I'm nobody. But I think I was able to meet the challenge. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4031.42s)]
*  I did what I had to when I had to. And I was lucky to be able to do it. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4036.42s)]
*  You'd have to be a hermit to not know that tomorrow, June 6th, marks the 50th anniversary of D-Day, the Normandy invasion. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4042.9s)]
*  It's a time of remembrance of things past, of tragic loss and triumphant victory. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4057.9s)]
*  Television shows use nostalgic pictures of planes and weapons that seem puny by comparison with today's lethal arsenals. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4062.9s)]
*  But there was one weapon that was remarkable by any standard. It didn't kill people. It listened to them. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4072.38s)]
*  And that's our story, first broadcast almost 20 years ago on 60 Minutes, The Ultra-Secret, and How We Won the War. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4079.38s)]
*  It is 1940. The Germans have swarmed over Europe. The British Army has just been evacuated, battered, from the beaches of Dunkirk. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4087.86s)]
*  It is not a question of Britain winning the war. It is a matter of survival. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4104.86s)]
*  And no man is more aware of that than Winston Churchill, spending his days and nights down here beneath the pavement of Parliament Square in the bomb-proof war room. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4110.339999999999s)]
*  Not much stands in the way of Hitler, but a small Royal Air Force and an antiquated Navy. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4120.339999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the conventional history of the time. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4125.339999999999s)]
*  But there is one more thing that only Churchill and a few others down here know about, and it will make the difference. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4128.339999999999s)]
*  A thing that will not only change the course of history, but now 30 years later will make us all rewrite that history. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4135.82s)]
*  A secret so secret it is only being talked about now. A secret so secret it was known as the Ultra-Secret. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4142.82s)]
*  Quite simply, every message Hitler and his generals sent to each other through an unbreakable code machine was shared almost simultaneously with Churchill and his generals. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4152.299999999999s)]
*  The unbreakable German code was broken. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4167.299999999999s)]
*  It all started here, 50 miles north of London, at Bletchley Park, in this Victorian mansion that is just ugly enough to be the set for one of those gothic horror movies. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4171.78s)]
*  But it once housed some of the best brains that Britain and the United States could muster. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4182.78s)]
*  An eccentric collection of musicians and chess players and mathematicians and crossword puzzle addicts. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4187.78s)]
*  Curious people whose idea of fun was to set themselves impossible problems and then proceed to solve them. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4193.78s)]
*  Most of them in their 20s, most of them plucked out of Oxford and Cambridge to do their bit in solving the most complicated crossword puzzle that man had yet devised. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4200.259999999999s)]
*  But all that genius would have been useless without this cipher machine, smuggled out of Germany in bits and pieces in 1939. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4211.259999999999s)]
*  It's the Enigma machine, and no device was more aptly named. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4219.259999999999s)]
*  This is the first time it's been publicly demonstrated. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4223.74s)]
*  Three different intelligence agencies tried to prevent us from showing it. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4226.74s)]
*  We agreed not to reveal how we came by these pictures or whose machine this is. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4230.74s)]
*  When the British first got it, they were dismayed by its possibilities. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4236.74s)]
*  It's not a transmitter, it only encodes and decodes messages. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4240.74s)]
*  An ordinary typewriter keyboard. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4245.74s)]
*  Three rotating cylinders, each with a full alphabet on them, would be randomly set each day. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4249.219999999999s)]
*  These would move as each key was punched, something like a slot machine. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4256.219999999999s)]
*  And this would scramble the message. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4261.219999999999s)]
*  And down below the truly diabolical part of Enigma. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4263.219999999999s)]
*  A plug board marked up A to Z that can randomly scramble the already scrambled message even further [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4267.219999999999s)]
*  through a maze of sophisticated electrical circuits that are advanced even by today's standards. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4274.7s)]
*  This is still classified information in a number of countries. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4280.7s)]
*  When the operator punches a key, a light on the alphabetical panel just above the keyboard lights up. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4284.7s)]
*  So given the scrambling effect, if he presses, say, F, C might light up. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4292.7s)]
*  Press F again, V might light up. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4298.7s)]
*  Press F yet again, and R might light up. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4303.179999999999s)]
*  So if he punches, say, M-O-R-L-Y-S-A-F-E-R-P-R-L-Q-M-R-N-G-S-P might appear on the panel. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4307.179999999999s)]
*  He would then send it by Morse, ordinary dots and dashes. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4319.179999999999s)]
*  Meaningless jumbos of five letter groups. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4323.179999999999s)]
*  That jumbo when typed up on the receiving Enigma machine, set with a matching plug board and rotors, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4326.179999999999s)]
*  would translate the message into plain language. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4332.66s)]
*  Let it be said though that those curious characters out at Bletchley had their hands full. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4335.66s)]
*  Especially when later the Germans were changing the Enigma settings every hour. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4340.66s)]
*  And so here in Hut 3 at Bletchley Park, they were breaking the settings and the codes from Hitler, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4345.66s)]
*  his field commanders, and the enormous submarine fleet within minutes. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4352.66s)]
*  The man in charge of securing that whole operation that would eventually employ 30,000 specialists [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4358.139999999999s)]
*  is Fred Winterbottom, who looks for all the world an English country squire. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4364.139999999999s)]
*  Today he quietly tends his farm along the rocky coast of Devonshire. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4369.139999999999s)]
*  But before World War II, he was a spy who wormed his way into friendship with the German High Command [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4373.139999999999s)]
*  and even new Hitler. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4379.139999999999s)]
*  And it was Winterbottom who passed on Ultra, Hitler's intercepted messages to Winston Churchill. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4381.139999999999s)]
*  How important did Churchill regard Ultra and its information? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4388.139999999999s)]
*  Absolutely as vital. In fact, he went so far as to let it be known, and I received this through my chief, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4393.139999999999s)]
*  that if anybody was found letting this secret out, they would be shot. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4403.139999999999s)]
*  The martyred city of Coventry. Amid the wholesale wreckage of a noble city... [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4410.139999999999s)]
*  Through Ultra, Churchill had advanced warning of the Germans' intentions to bomb the city of Coventry. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4416.62s)]
*  He weighed the price of civilian casualties against the keeping of what he called his most secret source. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4422.62s)]
*  For the attempt to evacuate the city would surely have alerted the Germans that their code had been broken. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4429.62s)]
*  The city was shattered. The secret was kept. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4435.62s)]
*  I think that Churchill valued this source to such an extent, he had to weigh up all the pros and cons, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4440.099999999999s)]
*  his decision, and a terrible decision to have to take. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4447.099999999999s)]
*  Having all the Ultra information was useless without the people to process it. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4456.099999999999s)]
*  The British threw out a great net and caught an odd assortment of code breakers, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4460.099999999999s)]
*  but they needed people to evaluate the intelligence. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4465.099999999999s)]
*  Peter Calvacoresi was a brilliant young German scholar who just left Oxford. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4468.58s)]
*  Today he is editor and chief executive of Penguin Books, Britain's biggest publishing house. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4473.58s)]
*  Once you have it in German, is the job finished, or do you have to then decode the German? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4479.58s)]
*  You've then got to interpret the message. This is the intelligence function. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4484.58s)]
*  It's not even jargon, it's just a series of figures. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4489.58s)]
*  It says 1, 117, 2, 15, 3, 9023, whatever it is. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4493.0599999999995s)]
*  Now unless the chap was receiving it, he knows that 1 means something, 2 means something, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4500.0599999999995s)]
*  3 means something, you're down to 10 or 20 or whatever it is. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4505.0599999999995s)]
*  But you have got to reconstruct over a period by looking at these things very carefully what 1 stands for, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4508.0599999999995s)]
*  and 2 and 3. Once you've done that, then you know that 1 is the number of aircraft serviceable, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4515.0599999999995s)]
*  2 is the number of gallons of petrol that you've got, whatever it may be. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4521.54s)]
*  Now it's extremely useful to know that the enemy on the following day has a unit [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4525.54s)]
*  which is supposed to have 36 aircraft, but in fact has only got 17, and five of them can't fly. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4532.54s)]
*  In the end, how decisive do you think was Ultra? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4538.54s)]
*  I would say that it was the decisive element in the Battle of the Atlantic, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4541.54s)]
*  and that this is extremely important because the Battle of the Atlantic was obviously decisive [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4547.0199999999995s)]
*  about the war as a whole. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4554.0199999999995s)]
*  In 1940 and 41, German U-boats ruled the Atlantic. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4557.0199999999995s)]
*  The loss in supply ships to Britain and isolated Britain became unsupportable. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4562.0199999999995s)]
*  The war was clearly being lost. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4567.0199999999995s)]
*  But Ultra began to read messages from triumphant German submarine commanders. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4577.0199999999995s)]
*  If we hadn't won the Battle of the Atlantic in the winter of 42, 43, we could have been knocked out. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4583.0199999999995s)]
*  We, I mean, is England. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4589.0199999999995s)]
*  Well now, if we had been knocked out, and France had already been knocked out, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4591.0199999999995s)]
*  you know, what happens to the Americans? What happens to you? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4595.0199999999995s)]
*  You can't cross the Atlantic because the U-boats are still there, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4598.0199999999995s)]
*  and in any case, if you do cross it, where do you go? [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4601.0199999999995s)]
*  The fact that we broke the U-boat code in November 42 [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4604.5s)]
*  and could therefore sink these U-boats much faster than they could arrive on the scene, [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4607.5s)]
*  now if you know where they were, and if you've got the right sort of aircraft, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4611.5s)]
*  and if you've got, as you had at that time, an improved depth charge, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4615.5s)]
*  you know, I mean, what chance did they have? Joy little. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4619.5s)]
*  This was decisive not only for the Battle of the Atlantic, but for the war. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4626.5s)]
*  How seriously did the commanders in the field regard the intelligence that you were giving them? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4631.98s)]
*  Well, as their lifeline. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4636.98s)]
*  General Bradley and General Patton, they all looked upon this as their lifeline. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4639.98s)]
*  They had it all on their plates in the enemy signals. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4644.98s)]
*  But did they all place equal importance on ultra-intelligence? [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4648.98s)]
*  Well, I don't think that General Mark Clark used it to the best advantage. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4653.98s)]
*  I think that Anne Zero was the first lost opportunity. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4658.459999999999s)]
*  We were able to tell Mark Clark right up to the moment of the setting off of the expedition [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4662.459999999999s)]
*  that the Germans had no idea we were going to land there. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4667.459999999999s)]
*  It was obvious from their signals. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4670.459999999999s)]
*  So they did attain complete surprise. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4672.459999999999s)]
*  And if they hadn't halted after the landing, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4675.459999999999s)]
*  if they'd gone forward to do what they were supposed to do, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4679.459999999999s)]
*  I think we should have knocked the German army's end ways. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4682.459999999999s)]
*  Yes, I've been told that before, and I'd like to say at the beginning, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4686.94s)]
*  it is completely false without any basis whatsoever. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4690.94s)]
*  I don't know what research he did, but I know he didn't have the courtesy to come and see me [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4695.94s)]
*  or ask me about it for what it would be worth to him, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4701.94s)]
*  or my chief of staff, General Grunther. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4704.94s)]
*  And we were the two who would receive the ultra. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4707.94s)]
*  And I want to state also that when I did receive ultra, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4712.419999999999s)]
*  particularly at Anne Zero, it was like manna from heaven. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4716.419999999999s)]
*  It was like somebody handing me intelligence on a silver platter [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4721.419999999999s)]
*  that I couldn't get any other way. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4725.419999999999s)]
*  And the fact that I got word, intercepted a message that Hitler had sent to his commander, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4727.419999999999s)]
*  that now that the Allies have landed at Anne Zero, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4733.419999999999s)]
*  it is our chance to drive them into the sea and drown them. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4736.419999999999s)]
*  And it was shocking to me because I knew the inadequate force [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4739.9s)]
*  that I had been required to go in with. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4743.9s)]
*  And these messages that I got from ultra indicated that eight divisions of Germans [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4745.9s)]
*  were going to concentrate on us rapidly. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4750.9s)]
*  And the only action to take was not to advance further out, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4753.9s)]
*  where we would be sawed off, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4757.9s)]
*  but to advance to where we could get a good defensive line [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4760.9s)]
*  and dig in and hold on, which we did. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4764.9s)]
*  And then reinforce and then move forward and attack and capture Rome as we did. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4769.379999999999s)]
*  Operation Overlord, the invasion of Europe at Normandy. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4782.379999999999s)]
*  Ultra was able to tell General Eisenhower, the supreme commander, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4786.379999999999s)]
*  the precise disposition of German troops. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4790.379999999999s)]
*  But even more important, as Allied troops splashed ashore, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4793.379999999999s)]
*  it was with the confidence that the Germans had fallen for the great deception on D-Day [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4796.86s)]
*  that the attack would come further north in the Pas de Calais. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4800.86s)]
*  Even by D plus three, ultra monitoring German radio traffic [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4804.86s)]
*  showed that the Germans still believed it [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4809.86s)]
*  and still maintain their main defensive units away from the Normandy beaches. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4812.86s)]
*  And Ike was to say later in a secret message [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4818.86s)]
*  that ultra was of priceless value at Normandy. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4821.86s)]
*  It saved thousands of Allied lives and was decisive to victory. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4825.339999999999s)]
*  How did Churchill feel about getting Hitler's messages [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4831.339999999999s)]
*  moments after they were sent? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4834.339999999999s)]
*  He absolutely reveled in it. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4837.339999999999s)]
*  And it was a curious feeling. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4839.339999999999s)]
*  There were Hitler's most secret signals coming through. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4842.339999999999s)]
*  And I knew both those men, Hitler and Churchill. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4846.339999999999s)]
*  And it was at the time when Hitler was getting pretty desperate. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4850.339999999999s)]
*  And I'm not the least psychic, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4854.82s)]
*  but I almost felt that Hitler's presence was in the office there with me [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4856.82s)]
*  as I was reading his most secret thoughts over the telephone to Churchill. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4860.82s)]
*  It was a curious feeling altogether. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4864.82s)]
*  It was terribly exciting. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4867.82s)]
*  It's been estimated that without Enigma's intelligence, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4869.82s)]
*  the D-Day landings would have been delayed by as much as two years. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4873.82s)]
*  So tomorrow, as we watch and remember the thousands of brave men [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4877.82s)]
*  who died storming those beaches, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4883.299999999999s)]
*  we might spare a moment for the giants, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4885.299999999999s)]
*  even the geniuses who made it all possible. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4888.299999999999s)]
*  More than 400,000 Americans died fighting in the Second World War. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4900.299999999999s)]
*  Adding to the heartache of that staggering loss, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4904.299999999999s)]
*  nearly one in five of those killed was declared missing in action. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4907.299999999999s)]
*  To this day, the families of some 73,000 unaccounted for servicemen [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4911.78s)]
*  have lived with the mystery of how they died [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4915.78s)]
*  and have been deprived of the comfort that comes from a burial. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4918.78s)]
*  At the end of the war, the technology didn't exist [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4921.78s)]
*  to find and identify many of the missing. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4924.78s)]
*  But today, it does. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4926.78s)]
*  This is the remarkable story of a group of volunteers [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4928.78s)]
*  who spend their own time and money [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4931.78s)]
*  quietly searching for these long-lost servicemen. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4934.78s)]
*  This is remarkable because of what they've discovered in recent years. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4938.259999999999s)]

*  and focus on Palau, a Pacific Island nation [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4944.259999999999s)]
*  that saw some of the fiercest fighting of the war 70 years ago, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4947.259999999999s)]
*  a place some pilots called a forgotten corner of hell. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4951.259999999999s)]
*  Fly today over Palau's 586 small islands [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4957.259999999999s)]
*  and miles of barrier reefs, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4960.259999999999s)]
*  and you'll see no sign of the carnage that once occurred here. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4962.259999999999s)]
*  But beneath the jungle canopy, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4966.74s)]
*  you can still find the rusted ruins of Japanese anti-aircraft guns [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4968.74s)]
*  and in the clear blue water, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4972.74s)]
*  a graveyard of planes and the men who flew them. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4974.74s)]
*  As the Second World War raged in the Pacific, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4980.74s)]
*  the islands of Palau were teeming with Japanese soldiers [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4983.74s)]
*  and under attack by American planes. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4986.74s)]
*  The skies overhead were filled with Hellcats, Corsairs, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4989.74s)]
*  Avengers and B-24 Liberators. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4992.74s)]
*  On September 1, 1944, this B-24, [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4996.74s)]
*  number 453 and its crew, took off on a bombing mission. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=4999.74s)]
*  453, like the B-24 in this newsreel, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5005.74s)]
*  was shot out of the sky and disappeared into the sea. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5008.74s)]
*  It was one of more than 200 American planes [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5011.74s)]
*  lost over Palau during the war. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5014.74s)]
*  This was a tough place. This was no pushover. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5021.74s)]
*  There was as much anti-aircraft fire available in this part of the Pacific [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5025.219999999999s)]
*  as anything that was over Tokyo. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5029.219999999999s)]
*  Today, Dr. Pat Scanon leads a group of volunteers [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5031.219999999999s)]
*  that look for the wreckage of American warplanes [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5034.219999999999s)]
*  and the missing airmen who flew them, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5037.219999999999s)]
*  including 453 and its crew of 11. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5039.219999999999s)]
*  They call themselves the Bent Prop Project. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5042.219999999999s)]
*  Many have military backgrounds. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5045.219999999999s)]
*  With permission from the Palauan government, [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5047.219999999999s)]
*  they come every year, paying their own expenses [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5049.219999999999s)]
*  to search in the sea and on land. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5052.7s)]
*  I think that's what took my breath away [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5054.7s)]
*  when I saw that star in bar. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5056.7s)]
*  When Scanon's team finds the remains of Americans, [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5058.7s)]
*  they inform the U.S. military, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5061.7s)]
*  whose job it is to recover and identify the missing airmen. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5063.7s)]
*  It all started when Scanon was vacationing in Palau 20 years ago [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5067.7s)]
*  and came across the wing of a B-24 [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5071.7s)]
*  with its propeller sticking out of the water at low tide. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5074.7s)]
*  The Bent Prop gave the group its name. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5077.7s)]
*  Was it surprising that it was still there? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5081.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5083.179999999999s)]
*  That moment you saw that, what did you think? [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5084.179999999999s)]
*  I think somebody died there. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5086.179999999999s)]
*  The wing and engine of the B-24 Scanon found in 1993 [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5088.179999999999s)]
*  are still here, the propeller undisturbed [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5092.179999999999s)]
*  in a few feet of water. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5095.179999999999s)]
*  Scanon says he hasn't been the same since he first found it. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5097.179999999999s)]
*  It was one of those special moments in life [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5101.179999999999s)]
*  where from one step to the next, [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5103.179999999999s)]
*  I knew I had to know what went on. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5105.179999999999s)]
*  It just was wrong to me that this wing is sitting here [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5108.66s)]
*  and nobody knows anything about it. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5111.66s)]
*  Finding the answers rarely comes easily or quickly. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5114.66s)]
*  Scanon's team spent ten years looking for 453, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5118.66s)]
*  acting on hunches and old battlefield reports. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5122.66s)]
*  But it wasn't until 2004, and a tip from a local fisherman, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5125.66s)]
*  that they finally found the wreckage. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5129.66s)]
*  That's the tail section of the plane. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5131.66s)]
*  It was about a mile away from where they'd been searching [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5133.66s)]
*  all those years. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5137.139999999999s)]
*  A mile away underwater might as well be on the moon. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5139.139999999999s)]
*  We spent years doing grid searches [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5143.139999999999s)]
*  in the area that we thought it was. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5145.139999999999s)]
*  Just methodically square by square underwater? [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5147.139999999999s)]
*  Square by square underwater. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5149.139999999999s)]
*  Because we knew it had to be here. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5151.139999999999s)]
*  You know, B-24 is a big thing. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5153.139999999999s)]
*  And at least on the map, these waters don't look that big, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5156.139999999999s)]
*  so how hard could it be? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5159.139999999999s)]
*  At least that's what we thought. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5161.139999999999s)]
*  Well, it turns out it's hard. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5163.139999999999s)]
*  The team went to 453 to dive with Pat Scanon and his team. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5165.62s)]
*  The site is now protected by the Plough and government. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5168.62s)]
*  When you first enter the water, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5171.62s)]
*  it's only a few seconds before you see the first signs [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5174.62s)]
*  of the plane. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5178.62s)]
*  The plane impacted and has hit the water, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5180.62s)]
*  and that's why it's now laying in sections. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5183.62s)]
*  At first, you might mistake it for coral. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5186.62s)]
*  And in fact, coral has been growing over it. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5189.62s)]
*  And over here, you can see the propeller. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5193.099999999999s)]
*  At the end of the game, it's not about finding aluminum. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5196.099999999999s)]
*  It's not about finding wreck sites. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5199.099999999999s)]
*  It's about finding the MIAs who are no longer MIA. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5201.099999999999s)]
*  The remains of eight crew members were found at this site [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5206.099999999999s)]
*  and later recovered and identified by the U.S. military. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5209.099999999999s)]
*  One of the men was Jimmy Doyle, a 25-year-old Texan [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5212.099999999999s)]
*  who was 453's nose gunner. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5215.099999999999s)]
*  You can still see the turret where he was sitting [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5218.099999999999s)]
*  when the plane crashed [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5220.099999999999s)]
*  and the remains were found. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5222.58s)]
*  That diver pausing in the spot is Jimmy Doyle's grandson, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5224.58s)]
*  Casey Doyle, an active-duty Marine who now volunteers [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5227.58s)]
*  with the Bent Prop Project. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5230.58s)]
*  Just to know where the last few moments of his life were [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5232.58s)]
*  is a very special time to see that down there. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5237.58s)]
*  And there's probably still a little, physically a little bit [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5240.58s)]
*  of him and the rest of the crew still down there. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5244.58s)]
*  So it's an incredibly powerful and special place for me. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5247.58s)]
*  Until Bent Prop found the wreckage, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5252.0599999999995s)]
*  Jimmy Doyle's family didn't talk much about him. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5254.0599999999995s)]
*  Some family members actually believed he survived the war [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5257.0599999999995s)]
*  and started a new life. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5260.0599999999995s)]
*  What did people say about your grandfather? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5262.0599999999995s)]
*  There's a whole generation of people in my family [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5264.0599999999995s)]
*  that just did not speak of this because of the unknown. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5267.0599999999995s)]
*  You can tell a family that their loved one is missing [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5271.0599999999995s)]
*  or that their loved ones were captured and were POWs. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5276.0599999999995s)]
*  But I swear to goodness, I have talked to families [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5279.54s)]
*  who really believe that grandpa somehow made it out, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5284.54s)]
*  was saved by the natives and had amnesia [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5288.54s)]
*  and was living on an island being taken care of [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5292.54s)]
*  by native girls. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5295.54s)]
*  Families really believe that? [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5297.54s)]
*  I've heard it. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5299.54s)]
*  Why would people think that? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5300.54s)]
*  I think it comes with the hope that someone missing [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5302.54s)]
*  may show up. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5305.54s)]
*  Jimmy Doyle finally returned home [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5308.0199999999995s)]
*  with seven of his crew members in 2010, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5310.0199999999995s)]
*  65 years after their plane was shot out of the sky. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5313.0199999999995s)]
*  A memorial was held in Arlington National Cemetery [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5320.0199999999995s)]
*  where some of the men were buried. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5323.0199999999995s)]
*  Pat Scanon was invited to attend. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5325.0199999999995s)]
*  What was it like to be at Arlington? [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5328.0199999999995s)]
*  I felt that my job on that plane was done [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5330.0199999999995s)]
*  and I actually, I stepped back [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5334.5s)]
*  and watched the ceremony from a ways off [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5336.5s)]
*  and it was extremely emotional. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5340.5s)]
*  You're emotional just thinking about it? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5343.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5345.5s)]
*  I think about it a lot actually. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5347.5s)]
*  What's the emotion for you? [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5349.5s)]
*  Happiness. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5351.5s)]
*  That they know what happened. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5353.5s)]
*  But not everyone from 453 has come home. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5355.5s)]
*  Just after the plane was hit, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5358.5s)]
*  three crew members parachuted out, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5360.5s)]
*  including 22-year-old Art Schumacher. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5362.98s)]
*  All three were quickly captured by the Japanese [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5365.98s)]
*  and according to witnesses, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5368.98s)]
*  taken to a camp in the jungle and executed. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5370.98s)]
*  The BENTPROP team is still looking for their remains, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5373.98s)]
*  but searching on land is no easier than in the ocean. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5376.98s)]
*  Pat Scanon has tried to pinpoint the location of the graves [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5380.98s)]
*  by traveling to Japan to interview [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5383.98s)]
*  former Japanese soldiers stationed in Palau. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5385.98s)]
*  And he's tracked down Palauans who say they saw the men [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5388.98s)]
*  just before they were captured. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5392.459999999999s)]
*  Oh you saw the parachutes? [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5394.459999999999s)]
*  Do you remember how many? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5396.459999999999s)]
*  What I saw, like three I think. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5398.459999999999s)]
*  One Palauan drew a map in the dirt [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5401.459999999999s)]
*  showing where he believed the prisoners were executed. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5403.459999999999s)]
*  Using that information, the BENTPROP team [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5406.459999999999s)]
*  has identified two spots in the jungle [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5408.459999999999s)]
*  where they think as many as a dozen Americans were killed. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5410.459999999999s)]
*  We were with them when they started digging. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5414.459999999999s)]
*  The red sticks are where buried pieces of metal were detected, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5417.459999999999s)]
*  probably fragments of munitions, [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5420.94s)]
*  but perhaps a prisoner's button or zipper. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5422.94s)]
*  The chance of finding Art Schumacher and the others [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5426.94s)]
*  on the first dig may be small, [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5429.94s)]
*  but Schumacher's niece Jo has flown here from Washington. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5431.94s)]
*  What would it mean to find your uncle? [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5434.94s)]
*  Oh gosh, we could bring him home. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5437.94s)]
*  We could bring him home to family. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5439.94s)]
*  We can do a proper burial, we can honor them. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5441.94s)]
*  And they gave their lives for their country. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5443.94s)]
*  Scanon's team has found debris [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5445.94s)]
*  from at least 30 American planes over the past 20 years. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5448.419999999999s)]
*  In addition to the eight airmen recovered from 453, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5452.419999999999s)]
*  BENTPROP's other discoveries could lead [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5455.419999999999s)]
*  to the return of 16 more MIAs from Palau. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5457.419999999999s)]
*  But many planes crashed in far less accessible parts [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5462.419999999999s)]
*  of the ocean and dense jungle, and their crews never found. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5465.419999999999s)]
*  Do you know how many Americans are still missing here? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5469.419999999999s)]
*  We think it's somewhere between 70, 80 American airmen [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5472.419999999999s)]
*  that crashed in this area. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5477.9s)]
*  The real question is how many crashed inside the barrier reef. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5478.9s)]
*  Inside the barrier reef means we can possibly find them. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5482.9s)]
*  Why, because outside? [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5485.9s)]
*  It's 2,000 feet deep. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5486.9s)]
*  In 2005, Scanon's team found this wing [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5488.9s)]
*  of a TBM Avenger in the jungle. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5491.9s)]
*  They believe the rest of the plane is in the water nearby, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5493.9s)]
*  and they've been searching for it the past nine years. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5496.9s)]
*  But we've never been able to find the feast lodge, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5499.9s)]
*  and so somewhere out here, there's a feast lodge, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5501.9s)]
*  possibly with two MIAs on it. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5506.379999999999s)]
*  To find the Avenger, BENTPROP has now been joined by a team [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5508.379999999999s)]
*  from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5511.379999999999s)]
*  and the University of Delaware. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5513.379999999999s)]
*  They bring high technology to the hunt. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5515.379999999999s)]
*  This research torpedo called REMIS [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5517.379999999999s)]
*  can scan large areas of ocean with sonar. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5519.379999999999s)]
*  Eric Terrell leads the effort. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5522.379999999999s)]
*  We ran the REMIS a few hours off of the mangroves here, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5524.379999999999s)]
*  found a couple of targets, dropped down, [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5528.379999999999s)]
*  got some visuals on the targets. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5530.379999999999s)]
*  If there is a place it ought to be, it's right here. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5532.379999999999s)]
*  Terrell leads the way with a hand-held sonar device [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5536.379999999999s)]
*  and is the first to come across debris, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5539.379999999999s)]
*  including part of the plane's tail. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5542.379999999999s)]
*  When the sonar shows signs of something ahead, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5544.379999999999s)]
*  he turns around to get Pat Scanon. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5547.379999999999s)]
*  He comes swimming up to me, grabs my hand, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5549.379999999999s)]
*  and practically yanks my arm off. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5552.379999999999s)]
*  And so I figured he probably knows something, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5555.379999999999s)]
*  and this gray hulk becomes an airplane, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5558.379999999999s)]
*  and there's a big propeller right there. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5561.379999999999s)]
*  You get misty, I got misty underwater. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5564.86s)]
*  You know, I said, you know, maybe this isn't [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5566.86s)]
*  such a good thing to do underwater, you know, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5568.86s)]
*  but, you know, I couldn't help it. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5570.86s)]
*  It was very emotional. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5572.86s)]
*  And when you put your finger on the plane, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5573.86s)]
*  it's real, and that's what we did. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5578.86s)]
*  You touch it? [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5581.86s)]
*  I touch it. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5582.86s)]
*  Why? [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5583.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5584.86s)]
*  You know, science is about facts. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5585.86s)]
*  I mean, my eyes saw it, you know. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5587.86s)]
*  I mean, so the fact was it was there, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5589.86s)]
*  but touching it, you know, just gave it a sense of finality. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5592.339999999999s)]
*  We all knew what this was and what it meant. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5596.339999999999s)]
*  They're Americans down there? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5600.339999999999s)]
*  They're Americans down there. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5602.339999999999s)]
*  The families don't even know yet, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5604.339999999999s)]
*  and it's not that I'm wanting to keep a secret, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5606.339999999999s)]
*  but we also, until the remains are properly identified, [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5609.339999999999s)]
*  we don't want to hold off false hope. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5613.339999999999s)]
*  To get proper identification, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5615.339999999999s)]
*  Ben Propp notifies the U.S. military of the discovery, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5617.339999999999s)]
*  but the actual recovery and identification of remains [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5620.82s)]
*  by the military can take years. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5623.82s)]
*  This plane was shot down over this area [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5626.82s)]
*  the 4th of May, 1945. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5629.82s)]
*  Every time Ben Propp finds wreckage of a plane [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5632.82s)]
*  with missing airmen, they hold a small ceremony. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5635.82s)]
*  They videotape it so that one day the families of the MIAs [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5638.82s)]
*  will know the respect shown to them by Scanan and his team, [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5641.82s)]
*  who've spent their own time and money to find them. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5644.82s)]
*  Over the Avenger crash site this year, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5648.299999999999s)]
*  Ben Propp unfurls an American and a plow and flag [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5650.299999999999s)]
*  and speak of the men who were lost. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5654.299999999999s)]
*  They say their names, their ages, [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5656.299999999999s)]
*  what they've learned of their lives. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5658.299999999999s)]
*  And at the end of every ceremony, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5660.299999999999s)]
*  Pat Scanan recites a poem written during World War I. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5662.299999999999s)]
*  It's called For the Fallen. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5666.299999999999s)]
*  Would you read it to me? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5668.299999999999s)]
*  Sure, I will read it to you. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5670.299999999999s)]
*  I can't read it without standing up. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5672.299999999999s)]
*  Can I stand up? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5674.299999999999s)]

*  At the going down of the sun and in the morning, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5684.78s)]
*  we will remember them. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5690.78s)]
*  Every spring, thousands of soldiers and civilians from across the country descend upon the desert [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5693.259999999999s)]
*  mountains of New Mexico for the Bataan Memorial Death March, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5699.259999999999s)]
*  a rugged 26.2-mile marathon that some run and others walk. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5703.259999999999s)]
*  The event commemorates the infamous battle of the MIAs [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5708.259999999999s)]
*  and the MIAs' long-standing commitment to the people. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5712.259999999999s)]
*  The MIAs are the most important force in the history of the country. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5716.259999999999s)]
*  The event commemorates the infamous force march of American and Filipino soldiers [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5720.74s)]
*  by the Japanese Army that killed thousands on the Bataan Peninsula [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5725.74s)]
*  during some of the darkest days of World War II. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5729.74s)]
*  A disproportionate number of the American prisoners were from the New Mexico National Guard. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5732.74s)]
*  It's why the memorial march is held annually at White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5738.74s)]
*  Like many soldiers, past and present, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5744.74s)]
*  Colonel Ben Skarden takes part for the historical symbolism. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5747.219999999999s)]
*  We first aired this story last year and decided to run it again this Memorial Day weekend. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5751.219999999999s)]
*  What makes Ben Skarden unique is that among all the participants in New Mexico, [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5757.219999999999s)]
*  he is the only survivor of the actual Bataan Death March. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5762.219999999999s)]
*  And one more thing, he is nearly 100 years old. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5766.219999999999s)]
*  At 98 years old, what keeps you going? [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5770.219999999999s)]
*  It doesn't take anything to keep me going, I'll tell you. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5773.7s)]
*  When I wake up in the morning, I say, let's go. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5776.7s)]
*  It's become a tradition. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5782.7s)]
*  Colonel Ben Skarden arriving a half hour before sunrise in his orange Clemson jacket [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5784.7s)]
*  as the corrals fill up with soldiers and American flags. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5790.7s)]
*  Many will carry backpacks weighing 35 pounds or more on the course. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5794.7s)]
*  A few will be testing new limbs. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5798.7s)]
*  Left, left. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5802.179999999999s)]
*  Before the Bataan Memorial Death March begins, there is a ceremonial roll call. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5805.179999999999s)]
*  Ben Skarden. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5810.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5812.179999999999s)]
*  For those who survived the real thing in 1942 [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5813.179999999999s)]
*  and who have come to brave the cold New Mexico morning. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5816.179999999999s)]
*  Forward march. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5819.179999999999s)]
*  Ben Skarden is the only one who marched then and will march now into the desert of White Sands. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5821.179999999999s)]
*  That's my Mecca. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5827.179999999999s)]
*  It became a place where I'm supposed to think about what went on during the march. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5829.66s)]
*  Is it good to remember? [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5836.66s)]
*  Because no one would blame you if you never wanted to think about that march again. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5838.66s)]
*  Oh, no ma'am, that's indelible in my mind. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5842.66s)]
*  The arduous course that awaits him is an indelible reminder of the haunting procession [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5845.66s)]
*  of starving American and Filipino soldiers who were ordered to walk 66 miles by the conquering Japanese Army. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5851.66s)]
*  It was a march to the grave. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5859.139999999999s)]
*  Thousands died along the way. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5862.139999999999s)]
*  The Bataan Death March, as it became known, is considered one of the most notorious crimes of World War II. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5864.139999999999s)]
*  Watch your step there. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5871.139999999999s)]
*  74 years later in New Mexico, Ben Skarden calmly watches as all 6,000 runners and marchers leave the starting line. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5873.139999999999s)]
*  And then he begins his pilgrimage. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5884.139999999999s)]
*  Enjoy your 8 miles. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5887.62s)]
*  8 and a half. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5889.62s)]
*  He hopes to walk the marathon's first 8 and a half miles as a tribute, just as he's done 8 times before. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5891.62s)]
*  Under the gaze of the Oregon Mountains, he's accompanied by what's called Ben's Brigade, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5899.62s)]
*  a band of 25 friends, family members and former students of this longtime English professor at Clemson University. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5905.62s)]
*  An Army medic and an ROTC cadet hover nearby, as do support vehicles, just in case. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5914.099999999999s)]
*  When you're 98, walking at an altitude of 4,000 feet, every mile marker can seem like a landmark. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5922.099999999999s)]
*  Mile one! [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5928.099999999999s)]
*  But the Colonel is in no mood to linger. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5930.099999999999s)]
*  We'll rest here 10 seconds. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5932.099999999999s)]
*  One, two, three, ten. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5934.099999999999s)]
*  Osh! [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5936.099999999999s)]
*  Osh! [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5938.58s)]
*  It's what Ben remembers the Japanese guards bellowing when they wanted their American and Filipino prisoners to keep moving on Baton. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5940.58s)]
*  Ben keeps moving in New Mexico... [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5947.58s)]
*  I got it. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5949.58s)]
*  ...over gullies and sand pits. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5951.58s)]
*  After passing mile two, he breaks into a rhythm and song. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5953.58s)]
*  A day without you is a day without love. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5957.58s)]
*  Water stations are named for towns along the Baton Death March. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5963.58s)]
*  Volunteers have learned to wait for Ben so they can pay their respects. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5968.0599999999995s)]

*  In April 1942, in the earliest months of the war, Ben Skarden was an Army company commander in the Philippines. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5976.0599999999995s)]
*  After four months of fighting, 76,000 outgunned and cornered American and Filipino troops were surrendered to the invading Japanese Army, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5984.0599999999995s)]
*  the largest surrender in American military history. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5994.54s)]
*  The prisoners massed at the bottom of the Baton Peninsula, which sticks out like a thumb along Manila Bay. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=5998.54s)]
*  Where did you think you were going? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6004.54s)]
*  I didn't have the slightest idea. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6006.54s)]
*  Geography-wise, all I knew was Manila would be at the end of the Manila Bay. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6008.54s)]
*  And I thought, well, we'll probably end up in the Manila Hotel. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6014.54s)]
*  The Japanese guards thought surrendering was beneath a soldier. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6018.54s)]
*  The Japanese soldiers held their prisoners in contempt. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6023.0199999999995s)]
*  Streams of Americans and Filipinos were herded along the old National Road in 95-degree heat, the sun searing their skin. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6025.0199999999995s)]
*  Skarden was already suffering from malaria when they first started walking, but he couldn't stop or slow down, not with the threat of Japanese bayonets. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6033.0199999999995s)]
*  That was the greatest fear on the march, the bayonet. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6043.0199999999995s)]
*  Did you see people get bayoneted? [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6047.0199999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6049.0199999999995s)]
*  They bayoneted right behind me. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6051.5s)]
*  Then I was out and I was terrified. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6053.5s)]
*  There were atrocities he couldn't miss. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6057.5s)]
*  There were two in the middle of a road, Americans. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6061.5s)]
*  And they'd been run over so many times. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6063.5s)]
*  By trucks. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6065.5s)]
*  That they were flattened out. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6067.5s)]
*  And you know how you cut out a silhouette of somebody? [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6069.5s)]
*  It looked like they could, a cardboard, you could pick them up. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6071.5s)]
*  Today, commercial traffic lines Bataan's old National Road, but the death march is remembered with signposts, little monuments to the struggle the prisoners face as they walk through the mountains and low-lying villages. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6075.98s)]
*  Always they headed north. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6089.98s)]
*  Skarden wondered if they'd ever get there, wherever there was. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6091.98s)]
*  I was just wishing that somewhere we could stop. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6095.98s)]
*  That's one of the miracles that happened to me. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6097.98s)]
*  Is to be in the condition I was in and to make the march and to not even sometimes know whether it was day or night because you just charged along. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6100.459999999999s)]
*  Prisoners dropped dead by the hour. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6110.459999999999s)]
*  Food and water were scarcer than Japanese empathy. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6112.459999999999s)]
*  What I had with me was a little bit of a [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6114.459999999999s)]
*  Where'd that come from? [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6127.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know where it came from, but it was in my pocket and I put my can of milk in there and held onto it the whole time. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6129.5199999999995s)]
*  So at night I pulled it out, I didn't show it to anybody. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6137.5199999999995s)]
*  And I would suck on it a little bit. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6139.5199999999995s)]
*  And let saliva go down your throat. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6141.5199999999995s)]
*  That was great. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6143.5199999999995s)]
*  So that milk really sustained you? [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6145.5199999999995s)]
*  I feel that saved my life. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6148.0s)]
*  Now when I tell you something saved my life, it saved my life. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6150.0s)]
*  That's not a cliche with me. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6154.0s)]
*  Every time he marches in New Mexico, Ben Skarden carries an emblematic can of condensed milk as if it's a family heirloom. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6156.0s)]
*  And so I went to the bar, and I went into the bar as I was driving. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6166.0s)]
*  I got in the bar, and I started digging. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6168.0s)]
*  He marches in New Mexico, Ben Skarden carries an emblematic can of condensed milk, as if [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6170.0s)]
*  it's a family heirloom. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6175.44s)]
*  As the temperatures rise dramatically, the long sandy path can start to seem endless. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6179.36s)]
*  But for Ben, marching in this setting at his own pace with no bayonet in sight is liberating. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6185.34s)]
*  Out here you look wide, there's no fence in sight, no guards. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6191.72s)]
*  You could almost say there's immense freedom. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6196.4s)]
*  It's also about the people that I knew who were like brothers to me. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6200.24s)]
*  And not a single one of them got back. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6207.639999999999s)]
*  I'm very lucky. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6211.099999999999s)]
*  And this is something to me that's obligatory. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6212.839999999999s)]
*  Obligatory? [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6215.639999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6216.639999999999s)]
*  I'm obligated to be here. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6217.639999999999s)]
*  To them? [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6219.759999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6221.5599999999995s)]
*  They aren't here, of course. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6222.719999999999s)]
*  They are Henry Leitner and Otis Morgan, fellow prisoners and fellow Clemson graduates who [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6224.92s)]
*  cared for Skarden after the death march finally came to an end, eight days after it had begun. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6231.04s)]
*  The finish line for the American captives was a disease-infested prison camp in the [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6237.76s)]
*  Philippine countryside, where Ben Skarden became gravely ill. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6242.72s)]
*  On top of his malaria, Ben was afflicted with beriberi due to a severe vitamin deficiency. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6247.8s)]
*  The danger of the beriberi was that it came up your legs. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6254.04s)]
*  It got to your heart, it kills you. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6259.84s)]
*  Your feet were so sensitive, nothing could touch them without you doing like that, see. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6261.68s)]
*  Henry would get a hold of my feet and then every time I jerked, he would squeeze. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6267.44s)]
*  Well, he would do that for hours. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6272.64s)]
*  Time meant nothing. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6276.76s)]
*  Otis, who spoke some Japanese, came up with a plan. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6278.32s)]
*  The bait was Ben's Clemson class ring of 1938. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6283.08s)]
*  He wears a replica today. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6287.4s)]
*  On the farm where the prisoners worked as slave labor, Otis approached a Japanese guard [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6289.56s)]
*  to make a deal. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6294.72s)]
*  Well, Otis let it be known through the guard that he knew of a gold ring for trade for [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6295.72s)]
*  food. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6302.32s)]
*  So Otis came in for the work detail and with a live chicken, pullet-sized, very thin. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6303.68s)]
*  You ate it all. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6311.36s)]
*  Then they boiled it in a pail and then they take that chicken broth and rice. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6312.44s)]
*  Man, that's great stuff. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6318.48s)]
*  Nourished again, Ben recovered. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6321.5599999999995s)]
*  Something restores my soul. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6324.599999999999s)]
*  All the things that were done for me, I could never thank them enough. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6326.48s)]
*  Ben never got to repay Henry and Otis. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6331.88s)]
*  Late in the war, the unmarked ships they were crammed into en route to POW camps in Japan [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6334.5199999999995s)]
*  were hit by American bombers, twice. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6340.2s)]
*  Ben survived both times. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6343.2s)]
*  Otis did not. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6345.32s)]
*  Henry died of pneumonia in a Japanese POW camp. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6347.0s)]
*  And if I could have cried, I would have cried. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6350.4s)]
*  Altogether, Ben was a prisoner of the Japanese for over a thousand days. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6354.96s)]
*  He was finally liberated from a camp in Manchuria, China by the Soviet Army in August 1945. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6360.2s)]
*  This is the first picture that was taken of him after he was freed. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6368.12s)]
*  Beverly is his given name. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6372.32s)]
*  That was a happy guy in that picture. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6374.5599999999995s)]
*  You look very thin here. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6376.84s)]
*  Well, I wasn't asking for compliments. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6378.16s)]
*  He came home to South Carolina and taught English at Clemson, where he was beloved by [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6382.36s)]
*  his students. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6387.08s)]
*  But few knew what he had endured. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6388.48s)]
*  I never spoke about it until I was 80 years old. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6390.96s)]
*  I felt humiliated. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6394.92s)]
*  Humiliated? [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6396.92s)]
*  That was one thing that I had a hard talk with in my own mind. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6398.72s)]
*  We surrendered. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6404.16s)]
*  We gave up. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6405.16s)]
*  It doesn't matter that he was awarded two silver stars and two bronze stars for gallantry [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6407.56s)]
*  and heroism in combat on Bataan. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6412.74s)]
*  When you came back to the United States, did you feel like a hero? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6416.16s)]
*  Don't even say that word in my presence. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6419.4s)]
*  I'm not a hero. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6421.12s)]
*  It's not how much you suffer. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6422.64s)]
*  That doesn't make you a hero. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6423.84s)]
*  Just outside Clemson's football stadium sits Memorial Park. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6427.56s)]
*  Etched in the cobblestones are the names of Clemson graduates who were killed in war. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6431.76s)]
*  They're really the true heroes, I suppose you would say. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6436.68s)]
*  Among them, Otis Morgan and Henry Leitner, the two men who saved his life. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6440.160000000001s)]
*  Ben likes to visit often and plant little American flags by their names. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6446.280000000001s)]
*  To me, there's a certain wonderment about my being here. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6451.400000000001s)]
*  How do you account for the fact that you were so sick and you made it home and these [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6457.52s)]
*  guys didn't? [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6462.4400000000005s)]
*  It remains a mystery, but I feel like that comes up when I walk out there. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6463.4400000000005s)]
*  I like to say I'm walking for you, Henry. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6474.56s)]
*  Otis. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6477.280000000001s)]
*  Hosh. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6478.280000000001s)]
*  More than three hours after Ben started, as he approaches the seven mile point on his [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6479.280000000001s)]

*  to just one generation. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6491.44s)]
*  All throughout the day, runners and marchers grind their way around the mountains and to [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6494.64s)]
*  the finish. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6499.76s)]
*  Twenty-six miles is too much to ask of a 98-year-old. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6507.0s)]
*  Long ago, he determined that eight and a half miles was his outer limit. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6513.52s)]
*  But for the ninth time, Ben's garden completes his personal march a half hour faster than [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6518.120000000001s)]
*  the year before. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6529.200000000001s)]
*  It's just a terrific, warm feeling. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6530.92s)]
*  Would you do it again next year? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6534.56s)]
*  If I'm in this condition, I'll be here next year. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6536.64s)]
*  I'll never turn this place loose. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6539.4800000000005s)]
*  Ben's garden did it again two months ago at age 99. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6547.2s)]
*  He turns 100 on July 14th and hopes to march in New Mexico next spring. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6551.32s)]
*  Twenty-nine years ago this Tuesday, August 6th, a new age began. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6565.84s)]
*  And millions of Americans under 30 are children of that age, the nuclear age. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6577.68s)]
*  To them, Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the mushroom cloud may only be symbols of fear. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6582.04s)]
*  It must be difficult for them to imagine the emotions of the mid-forties, when good and [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6587.76s)]
*  evil were simple and divisible. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6591.78s)]
*  The war was not only conventional, but noble. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6594.4s)]
*  It all changed after Hiroshima. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6597.679999999999s)]
*  Those who do not know or remember precisely what happened to Hiroshima certainly do know [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6600.2s)]

*  We went back 30 years and 8,000 miles to see what Hiroshima and Nagasaki are like today. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6615.2s)]
*  Hiroshima up to 1945 was barely touched by war. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6622.48s)]
*  There were some military installations, but not enough industry to attract the attention [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6626.56s)]
*  of the planners of the massive B-29 firebomb raids. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6631.04s)]

*  It had only one air raid. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6649.82s)]
*  A stray B-29 once dropped 10 bombs on it. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6651.42s)]
*  Hiroshima was famous throughout Japan for its oysters. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6655.82s)]
*  It was a good marketplace. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6658.54s)]
*  The cameraman had no idea that he was photographing the condemned. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6660.9s)]
*  The bomb was dropped at 8.15 in the morning, August 6. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6665.82s)]
*  The only entry in the copilot's diary was, my god. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6673.82s)]

*  Scientists estimate that the detonation of the atomic bomb, lasting only a millionth [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6701.46s)]
*  of a second, created a ball of fire hotter than the center of the sun and released radiations [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6705.9s)]

*  And then, three days later, August 9, 1945, the second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6728.34s)]
*  In Nagasaki, approximately one third of the built-up area was destroyed by fire. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6736.02s)]

*  The power of the light alone was enough to affect the retina of the eye. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6763.18s)]
*  At Hiroshima, it is estimated that the heat at the center of the explosion was some 126 [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6767.18s)]
*  million degrees Fahrenheit and as far as a quarter of a mile away, reached about 3,600 [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6773.18s)]
*  degrees. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6779.26s)]
*  And so, on August 6, 1945, a new science and a new area of medical research is born. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6780.94s)]
*  It was needed just to deal with Hiroshima. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6789.099999999999s)]
*  They found that even the lightest body coverings offered great protection from burns. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6792.4s)]
*  A leather sandal thong, a cotton undershirt. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6797.54s)]
*  And they found that atomic bombs produced a great harvest of death because unlike conventional [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6810.92s)]
*  bombs, it killed with heat, with blast, and with radiation. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6816.4400000000005s)]
*  Radiation was the tricky one because the victims of gamma rays looked perfectly normal, felt [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6821.9s)]
*  a bit queasy, but had no idea how sick they were. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6826.88s)]
*  So a few weeks after the bomb, they just fell dead. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6831.04s)]
*  This man died a few days after his picture was taken. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6835.8s)]
*  So everything that was not already dead in Hiroshima was waiting to die. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6839.52s)]
*  A month after the bomb, people were still dying at the rate of 100 a day. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6846.200000000001s)]
*  The killer was invisible as the air itself. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6851.72s)]
*  The Japanese felt Hiroshima would be poisoned for generations. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6855.64s)]
*  The earth would be forever barren. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6859.68s)]
*  They were wrong. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6862.320000000001s)]
*  The bomb played a final bitter joke on everyone. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6864.240000000001s)]
*  In a few weeks, flowers began to curl out of the wreckage as though the soil had become [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6868.26s)]
*  revitalized by the heat and radiation. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6873.34s)]
*  But in Hiroshima that August day, barely one brick stood squarely on another. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6877.360000000001s)]
*  This is just about all that remains of the Hiroshima of August 6, 1945. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6886.2s)]
*  The one building left standing was not a temple nor some museum housing the cultural immortality [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6891.780000000001s)]
*  of Japan, but an industrial exhibition hall. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6896.94s)]
*  If you come to Hiroshima seeking either guilt or justification, you will not find it. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6901.179999999999s)]
*  The Japanese seemed to leave it for others to ponder. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6906.82s)]
*  The Holocaust of that summer morning meant that quite simply two things had to be done. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6910.0199999999995s)]
*  Discover the effects of this new way of killing. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6915.7s)]
*  That was for the Americans to do. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6918.08s)]
*  And for the Japanese to build a brand new city, to make that industrial exhibition hall [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6920.299999999999s)]
*  more than a memorial to defeat. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6926.04s)]
*  And they succeeded. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6930.4400000000005s)]
*  You may not know it, but if you drive a Mazda car, it started right here in Hiroshima at [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6931.820000000001s)]
*  the Mitsubishi Works, not far from where they also make the Dodge Colt for the Chrysler [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6936.76s)]
*  Corporation. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6941.64s)]
*  And those famous Hiroshima oysters were not affected by the atom bomb or its fallout. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6943.2s)]
*  There was an oyster crisis, but that was due to industrial pollution. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6947.9800000000005s)]
*  The Mitsubishi shipyards are probably responsible for bringing you the gas you put in your car. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6952.72s)]
*  They make the super tankers that apply between the Middle East oil fields and the refineries [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6958.22s)]
*  of America. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6962.360000000001s)]
*  And Hiroshima has kept its reputation as a marketplace. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6964.0s)]
*  Like the rest of Japan, it is stuffed with goods. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6967.4800000000005s)]
*  And the emphasis is on everything Western. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6970.68s)]
*  And everything is new, post-1945. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6973.240000000001s)]
*  The population of Hiroshima has doubled since the war, about half a million people. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6976.68s)]
*  Hiroshima may be the perfect example of the world village. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6984.96s)]
*  There is little beyond advertisements that tell you you are in Japan. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6988.72s)]
*  It could be the Midwest of the United States or Belgium or anywhere. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6993.52s)]
*  There are still the sake bars catering to the new, rich, industrial Japanese men. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=6998.88s)]
*  But such relics are being rapidly replaced by Mr. Donut and his franchise cousins, [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7003.88s)]
*  McDonald and Saunders. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7010.04s)]
*  Had they been there in 45, along with Diners Club and American Express, we may not have [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7012.84s)]
*  dropped the bomb. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7017.76s)]
*  Indeed, had they had them there, there may not have been a Pearl Harbor. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7019.08s)]
*  The Japanese passion for bowling is surpassed only by the Japanese passion for golf. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7024.36s)]
*  Hiroshima was the world's most damaged city. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7029.36s)]
*  It has become Japan's most Americanized city. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7032.16s)]
*  Nagasaki took the second bomb, code-named Fat Man. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7036.92s)]
*  It was a bigger bomb, but fell three miles off target and therefore killed only 39,000 [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7040.96s)]
*  people. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7046.96s)]
*  There used to be a macabre competition between the two countries. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7048.96s)]
*  There used to be a macabre competition between the two cities. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7051.96s)]
*  A kind of, we may be number two, but our bomb was bigger. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7055.16s)]
*  Even more macabre, some survivors of Hiroshima fled to Nagasaki to be bombed again. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7060.16s)]
*  The United States knew it was using no ordinary weapon. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7066.96s)]
*  Right after the war, the ABCC was set up, the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7070.36s)]
*  It continues to examine and catalog every survivor and the children of survivors and [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7076.96s)]
*  will stay in operation until the last survivor has died. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7082.360000000001s)]
*  The stigma of Hiroshima is maintained. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7086.860000000001s)]
*  Most do not want it known they are victims. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7089.660000000001s)]
*  Victims are often pariahs. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7092.660000000001s)]
*  Engagements were broken off when a partner was discovered to have been a victim. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7094.56s)]
*  Victims could not get work. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7099.56s)]
*  There was a widespread belief that women would be barren. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7102.400000000001s)]
*  The atomic disease was blamed for everything, colds, dandruff, heart disease. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7105.66s)]
*  In the 50s, anyone who died was said to have been a victim of the bomb. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7111.0599999999995s)]
*  More may be known about the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki than any other people on earth. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7116.66s)]
*  Every change in their systems, physical and psychological, has been catalogued, computerized. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7122.66s)]
*  The bomb produced no genetic damage. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7130.26s)]
*  No deformities in children of victims except for women who were pregnant at the time. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7132.96s)]
*  No permanent sterility. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7138.16s)]
*  But it did produce anemia, which killed many, but disappeared among other victims. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7140.66s)]
*  And many forms of cancer, which was not detectable until two or three years after the bomb. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7146.06s)]
*  Dr. Gil Beebe at the ABCC in Hiroshima has spent many years studying atom bomb casualties. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7152.86s)]
*  The first thing that happened was the cataract story within say two or three years. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7160.76s)]
*  And then about 1948 or 49 we started seeing leukemia. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7165.96s)]
*  And leukemia peaked perhaps in 52 or 53. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7171.76s)]
*  It still hasn't come back to zero yet. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7175.56s)]
*  And it's terribly important that one be able over the course of calendar time to plot the [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7179.66s)]
*  latency period, the sleeping period when nothing is going on, and then the uptake period. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7184.860000000001s)]
*  For leukemia, say it was three to five years. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7190.16s)]
*  For breast cancer, it may have been 10 or 15. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7193.96s)]
*  If there is a bone cancer effect, it may be 20 or 25. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7197.36s)]
*  So each of these has its own latency period. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7201.26s)]
*  Does this have any applicability to other questions of such as nuclear power and the [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7204.36s)]
*  worries that Americans have about nuclear radiation from waste, all of that? [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7209.76s)]
*  We're going to be more conservative. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7214.26s)]
*  We're going to require that the power people put more lead on, so to speak, to protect us. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7216.26s)]
*  And also we're going to require, I think, more objective evidence that for each new [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7221.5599999999995s)]
*  increment of exposure that the population gets, there be some benefit, some tangible [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7228.76s)]
*  benefit in terms of energy or quality of life or something because we're really talking [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7235.36s)]
*  about lives lost. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7240.46s)]

*  Atsuko Yamamoto was one of the 25 Hiroshima maidens, young women sent to New York for [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7253.96s)]

*  In the immediate post-war years, neighborhood children taunted her, called her an ogre or [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7292.16s)]
*  goblin. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7297.16s)]
*  Her mother would chase them away. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7298.16s)]

*  had atom bombs and Japan had none. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7339.16s)]
*  And the United States used it upon us. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7343.16s)]
*  If we had, if the Japanese had atom bombs, we might have used it against America because [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7346.16s)]
*  it was a war. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7354.16s)]
*  And in other words, we feel we are guilty. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7355.16s)]
*  We attacked Pearl Harbor and began the war. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7362.16s)]
*  And then you drop the atom bomb on Hiroshima to finish up. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7366.16s)]
*  The ethical problem of using atom bomb is your problem and not ours. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7371.16s)]
*  That whole period, Pearl Harbor to the atom bomb could be described as a testament to [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7383.16s)]
*  evil. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7389.16s)]
*  But there is something else to be learned. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7390.16s)]
*  The extraordinary resilience of people, that germ in us that makes life more important [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7392.16s)]
*  than death. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7398.16s)]
*  And no nation has proved that better than the Japanese in the post-Hiroshima years. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7399.16s)]
*  But there is that nagging ethical question. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7405.16s)]
*  Would we have used the bomb on Caucasians, on Germany say? [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7408.16s)]
*  And the other argument, how many lives, Japanese and American were saved because the bomb ended [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7412.16s)]
*  the war so abruptly? [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7419.16s)]
*  Upsetting thoughts, upsetting too to realize how undestructive the old atom bomb was compared [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7421.16s)]
*  to the ways of killing that we've discovered since 1945. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7429.16s)]
*  It's upsetting in a way to know that the Model T bomb, the dirty bomb, produced no long-term [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7433.16s)]
*  genetic defects. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7440.16s)]
*  It was more scary and more comforting to believe that the bomb would make all future babies [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7441.16s)]
*  mutant freaks. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7446.16s)]
*  It made for restraint. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7447.16s)]
*  And it somehow bothers my sense of the fitness of things that Hiroshima, the very word means [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7449.16s)]
*  the prelude to total annihilation, should take Diners Club and American Express and [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7455.16s)]
*  have a downtown Mr. Donut. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7462.16s)]
*  But people can't live in graveyards. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7465.16s)]
*  And Americans are enterprising people and the Japanese are enterprising people and both [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7467.16s)]
*  really would rather forget that awful morning in August. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7473.16s)]
*  A nuclear war has not happened mainly because of the example of Hiroshima because the bomb [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7477.16s)]
*  has been held in the hands of presumably sane and rational men. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7482.16s)]
*  But the nuclear club has now expanded to six nations and at least 20 more are capable of [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7487.16s)]
*  making one. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7492.16s)]
*  And surely the day grows closer when less rational, more desperate men will possess [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7493.16s)]
*  the power to destroy everything. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7498.16s)]
*  You're about to see secrets of the Nazi Holocaust that have been hidden away for more than 60 [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7508.16s)]
*  years. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7514.16s)]
*  We're not talking about a missing filing cabinet. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7515.16s)]
*  We're talking about thousands of filing cabinets holding 50 million pages, Hitler's [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7517.16s)]
*  secret archive. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7523.16s)]
*  The Nazis were famous for record keeping, but as we first reported in December, what [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7525.16s)]
*  we found ran from the bizarre to the horrifying. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7529.16s)]
*  This Holocaust history was discovered by the Allies in dozens of concentration camps as [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7532.16s)]
*  Germany fell in the spring of 1945. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7538.16s)]
*  The documents were taken to a town in the middle of Germany called Bad Aurelsen where [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7541.16s)]
*  they were sorted, filed and locked away, never to be seen by the public until now. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7545.16s)]
*  The storerooms are immense, 16 miles of shelves holding the stories of 17 million victims, [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7553.16s)]
*  not only Jews but slave laborers, political prisoners and homosexuals. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7561.16s)]
*  To open the files is to see the Holocaust staring back like it was yesterday. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7567.16s)]
*  Strange pink Gestapo arrest warrants as lethal as a death sentence. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7572.16s)]
*  Jewelry lost as freedom ended at the gates of an extermination camp. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7577.16s)]
*  Time stopped here in 1945. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7582.16s)]
*  We walked through the evidence with Chief Archivist Udo Joost. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7588.16s)]
*  He showed us this list of 1,000 prisoners saved by a factory owner who told the Nazis [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7591.16s)]
*  he needed the prisoners' labor. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7597.16s)]
*  This is Oskar Schindler's list, made famous by the Steven Spielberg movie. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7599.16s)]
*  Here are the 700 men and the 300 women whose names were on Schindler's list. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7607.16s)]
*  Esther Friedman, Rosa Friedlich, Reina Ferber, the people of Schindler's list. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7613.16s)]
*  We also found the file of Frank, Annalise Marie, better known as Anne Frank. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7622.16s)]
*  It's her paper trail from Amsterdam to Bergen-Beltzen where she died at the age of 15. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7628.16s)]
*  But most of the names here are unknown. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7635.16s)]
*  Totenbuch means death book. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7638.16s)]
*  And just look at the names of the executed, crowded onto pages, single-spaced. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7641.16s)]
*  It must have been tiring just to write this, let alone kill them all. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7647.16s)]
*  Here we see the cause of death, executed. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7654.16s)]
*  And you can see every two minutes they shot one prisoner. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7657.16s)]
*  So they shot a prisoner every two minutes for a little over an hour and a half. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7661.16s)]
*  Yes. Now look at the date. It's the 20th of April. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7669.16s)]
*  That was Adolf Hitler's birthday. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7673.16s)]
*  And this was a birthday present, a gift for the Führer. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7676.16s)]
*  That's the bureaucracy of the devil. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7682.16s)]
*  The devil is in the details, the smallest details. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7686.16s)]
*  We were amazed to see that the Nazis were keeping records of head lice. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7690.16s)]
*  Lice control. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7697.16s)]
*  You can see the names and numbers of each prisoner and the amount of lice that were found. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7700.16s)]
*  The Nazis couldn't have disease spreading among slave laborers. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7707.16s)]
*  You can see he was a perfectionist. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7714.16s)]
*  He even put down the size of the lice. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7716.16s)]
*  Large, small or medium sized lice. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7718.16s)]
*  Paul Shapiro helped pry open the archive. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7723.16s)]
*  He's director of Holocaust studies at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7725.16s)]
*  I'm curious, why did the Nazis keep all these records? [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7731.16s)]
*  If they were going to murder these people anyway, why keep paperwork? [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7734.16s)]
*  Because they wanted to show they were getting the job done. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7740.16s)]
*  So in terms of people whose destiny was to be murdered, [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7744.16s)]
*  recording how well that was being done was very important. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7750.16s)]
*  And those records make up the largest Holocaust archive anywhere. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7755.16s)]
*  Run by the Red Cross, the International Tracing Service, as it's known, [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7760.16s)]
*  was set up after the war to trace lost family members. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7764.16s)]
*  Survivors could write for information, [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7768.16s)]
*  but there was a backlog of 400,000 unanswered letters, [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7770.16s)]
*  and neither survivors nor scholars got past the lobby. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7774.16s)]
*  What was the stated reason for keeping these documents out of the public eye for more than 60 years? [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7779.16s)]
*  Respect for the privacy of individuals was the most often cited reason. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7785.16s)]
*  On the one hand, you had governments stating we're protecting people's privacy. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7791.16s)]
*  And on the other hand, you had those very people saying, no, no, we want the material to be open. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7796.16s)]
*  But opening the archives has taken longer than expected. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7802.16s)]
*  Although the process began 15 months ago, it won't be completed until next fall. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7805.16s)]
*  But we brought these men to Bad Arlson for an advanced look. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7811.16s)]
*  Walter Fieden, Mickey Schwartz, and Jack Rosenthal are the first Holocaust survivors ever in the archive. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7815.16s)]
*  Schwartz of San Diego was 14 when he watched his parents herded to the gas chambers at Auschwitz [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7823.16s)]
*  and then later was forced to sign himself in at Buchenwald. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7830.16s)]
*  Can I touch it? [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7835.16s)]
*  Please, yes, absolutely. In a sense, it's yours. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7837.16s)]
*  Thank you. It's Nicholas Schwartz. It's my writing. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7840.16s)]
*  We asked the Red Cross to find all the documents for our three survivors. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7845.16s)]
*  There were plenty of surprises, including a mysterious reprieve. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7850.16s)]
*  This is a transport list for prisoners leaving Buchenwald and going to a camp called Dora. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7856.16s)]
*  Yes. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7864.16s)]
*  Do you know what Dora was? [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7865.16s)]
*  Yes, some sort of fabrication of armament. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7866.16s)]
*  The arms fabricated at Dora were the V-1 and V-2 rockets that rained on London. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7870.16s)]
*  And the story of that place is hardly anybody got out of there alive. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7876.16s)]
*  Look at your name. It's on the transport list to go there. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7882.16s)]
*  And somebody's drawn a line straight through the middle of it. They took you off the list. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7887.16s)]
*  Did you know until this moment that you were headed to Dora? [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7893.16s)]
*  No. Never, never, never, never. Wow. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7896.16s)]
*  Schwartz had no idea why he was taken off the list. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7903.16s)]
*  Of 50 people on the page, he was one of only two with a lifeline straight through his name. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7906.16s)]
*  I'm sort of, yes, I'm shaking. I'm scared right now. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7913.16s)]
*  Looking at that paper makes you scared right now. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7918.16s)]
*  Right now it makes me think back. And I'm living like there is this 14-year-old youngster and they wanted to kill him. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7921.16s)]
*  I don't know why I did not ever do anything, any harm to anybody. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7932.16s)]
*  I think I should have a middle name, my middle name to be Mr. Lucky. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7936.16s)]
*  Walter Fieden of New York was 13 and a prisoner in a Nazi ghetto where his parents died. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7944.16s)]
*  Later he too signed into Buchenwald. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7950.16s)]
*  Look down here. You signed it. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7954.16s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. I had better handwriting then than I have now, but yes. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7960.16s)]
*  Who was that boy who signed this card? [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7966.16s)]
*  A young, actually teenager who had gone through a great deal, become less trusting of what's told to him. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7972.16s)]
*  Just a second. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7987.16s)]
*  But glad to be alive still. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=7995.16s)]
*  You got to overcome it. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8003.16s)]
*  You have to overcome what? [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8007.16s)]
*  Breaking down. Because that's one thing we never did in the camp. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8010.16s)]
*  We never wanted to break down in front of some SS man and give him the pleasure of seeing us breaking down. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8016.16s)]
*  How do you stop yourself from breaking down? [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8022.16s)]
*  I chew my lips. Have you noticed that? The lower lip. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8025.16s)]
*  And that's what you did in the camps? [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8029.16s)]
*  Oh yes. Oh yes. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8031.16s)]
*  And you have to swallow after that. That helps also. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8036.16s)]
*  This card carried his barracks number, 66, and that number alone opened his memory. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8039.16s)]
*  How many people would have been in block 66? [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8047.16s)]
*  A thousand. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8050.16s)]
*  A thousand? [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8051.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. That's correct. That's correct. Oh my god, what just popped into my mind. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8052.16s)]
*  Between each block there was a trough that he could urinate in. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8059.16s)]
*  And I can see it now. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8066.16s)]
*  And the block manager felt that this person is just about dead. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8068.16s)]
*  We put these near-dead people into that trough that other people urinated into. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8079.16s)]
*  And let them die in those things. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8086.16s)]
*  The brutality of it. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8093.16s)]
*  Jack Rosenfall, also of New York, arrived with his family at Auschwitz the same month that the Nazis took these rarely seen photos. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8099.16s)]
*  In a process like this, Jack and his uncle were sent to a barracks while his mother and five sisters and brothers went straight to the gas chambers and the ovens. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8108.16s)]
*  I remember that night there was a little window in the barracks where we were. He told me, look out the window, what do you see? [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8118.16s)]
*  And I said, the sky is a flame. The sky is burning. And really, you saw the flames licking the sky. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8126.16s)]
*  The stench was terrible. You smelled burning flesh. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8134.16s)]
*  His family burned that night. Yet, incredibly, we found the Nazis had bothered to create a form to keep track of Jack's mail at Buchenwald. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8138.16s)]
*  But as you can see, there are no records of letters. You didn't... [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8149.16s)]
*  Who wrote me letters to Buchenwald? [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8154.16s)]
*  Apparently no one. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8156.16s)]
*  You didn't. So who is going to send me mail? [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8157.16s)]
*  I got news for you. If I would have died in Buchenwald, nobody, nobody would ever shed a tear for me because my whole family was wiped out before then. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8161.16s)]
*  We were a family of eight. And I'm the sole survivor. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8174.16s)]
*  This is that survivor, Jack, as American soldiers found him in 1945. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8179.16s)]
*  On this personal effects card that you signed in Buchenwald, there's a number up here. It's A118... [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8186.16s)]
*  32. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8196.16s)]
*  32. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8197.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8198.16s)]
*  You seen that number before? [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8199.16s)]
*  I see it every time. You want to see it? [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8201.16s)]
*  Sure. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8203.16s)]
*  No problem. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8205.16s)]
*  There it is. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8210.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8212.16s)]
*  A11... [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8213.16s)]
*  A11832. It's there. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8214.16s)]
*  And when I'll die, they shouldn't cover up my arm. They should leave it like this. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8219.16s)]
*  Because when the good Lord will see this, I hope he's going to put me front row center because I deserve it. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8224.16s)]
*  These men were the first to see their documents. But the Bad Arlesen archive is being digitally scanned to be distributed to research centers. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8233.16s)]
*  Other survivors may yet discover unknown history still waiting to be written. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8242.16s)]
*  Are you glad you looked back at the documents? [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8247.16s)]
*  Definitely. I feel like I learned about me at least what happened. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8250.16s)]
*  And specifically what I'm glad about for those people who said the Holocaust didn't happen, like the president of Iran, if they have any question about it, [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8256.16s)]
*  please come to Bad Arlesen and check it out for themselves. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8269.16s)]
*  This is a story of survival. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8274.16s)]
*  The incredible story of how a six-year-old Jewish boy survived the Nazis' final solution and kept how he survived a secret for more than 50 years. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8284.16s)]
*  It's the story of Alex Kurzem, who at the age of six watched his family being shot by the Nazis. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8294.16s)]
*  He escaped and wandered alone for months until he was captured by Nazi soldiers. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8300.16s)]
*  But instead of killing him, they made him their mascot. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8305.16s)]
*  That's right, Jewish boy mascot for the Nazis. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8309.16s)]
*  Alex was so young, he quickly forgot his family name, his age, and the name of his village. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8313.16s)]
*  But he did remember that the Nazis had fenced the Jews into a ghetto. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8319.16s)]
*  And on his last night there, Nazi soldiers burst into his house and began beating his mother. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8324.16s)]
*  I remember when she shielded me that her blood dripping. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8331.16s)]
*  I felt my face and there was blood on my head. It was my mother's blood. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8336.16s)]
*  You were hiding? [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8341.16s)]
*  Under the skirts of the three of us. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8342.16s)]
*  I had a little brother and sister and she was shielding us sort of. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8344.16s)]
*  She could shield them from the soldiers' blows, but not their bullets. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8349.16s)]
*  And she told Alex that the next day they would all be shot. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8353.16s)]
*  That night my mother took me in her arms and she said, tomorrow we all have to die. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8357.16s)]
*  And I told myself, I don't want to die. I'll have to try to escape. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8364.16s)]
*  So that night, crawling through the grass, he snuck past Nazi soldiers and up to the top of a hill [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8370.16s)]
*  and hid in a forest overlooking the village. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8376.16s)]
*  And when the daylight broke I heard a lot of commotion and noise below. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8379.16s)]
*  When I looked down I saw soldiers lining up people and shooting them in a big, big pit. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8384.16s)]
*  And then I saw my mother with my brother and sister also. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8391.16s)]
*  You saw your mother and your brother and your sister? [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8395.16s)]
*  All being led to the pit. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8398.16s)]
*  I hate to ask you this, but did you see your mother being shot? [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8400.16s)]
*  Yes, I saw them all lined up. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8404.16s)]
*  And you still see it today? [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8410.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's very visible in my head all the time. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8411.16s)]
*  Village records say the Nazis massacred more than 1,600 people there on October 21, 1941. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8416.16s)]
*  And Nazi records show that a Nazi battalion took Alex in on July 12, 1942. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8423.16s)]
*  The months in between are a mystery. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8430.16s)]
*  Alex says all he remembers is wandering alone, cold and hungry in the forest. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8432.16s)]
*  He took a winter coat off a dead soldier to keep from freezing to death. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8438.16s)]
*  And he slept in empty sheds and in trees by tying himself to branches. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8442.16s)]
*  Why did you decide to sleep in trees? [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8447.16s)]
*  I heard wolves in the distance, and I knew that if the wolves find me asleep on the ground, they would eat me, most likely. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8449.16s)]
*  So I got scared of that. So the only way to survive was to climb a tree. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8459.16s)]
*  He begged for food at farmhouses until one day he knocked on the wrong door. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8465.16s)]
*  The man said to me, you're a Jew, you shouldn't be alive. You should be dead with the others. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8471.16s)]
*  I'll take you to be shot. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8477.16s)]
*  And he took you to be shot, didn't he? [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8479.16s)]
*  He dragged me to the school yard where there were lining up people and shooting them. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8481.16s)]
*  And the soldier who was nearby me, I said to him, please, before you kill me, would you give me a bit of bread? [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8486.16s)]
*  All I was thinking, I'm hungry. Wish I could get a bit of bread before I die. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8494.16s)]
*  The soldier who gave you bread, he then took you around. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8499.16s)]
*  Into the school. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8504.16s)]
*  Into the schoolhouse. And he said he wanted to see if you're Jewish. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8505.16s)]
*  That's right. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8509.16s)]
*  So he made you lower your pants. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8510.16s)]
*  That's it. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8511.16s)]
*  And he saw you were Jewish. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8512.16s)]
*  And he said, no good, no good, no good. That's all he kept saying. No good, no good, no good. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8513.16s)]
*  I understand that he put a pistol to his own head to show you what was going to happen to you. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8518.16s)]
*  If they find out you're Jewish. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8523.16s)]
*  But then he says, that soldier took pity on the little boy. He not only gave Alex bread, he gave him his life. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8525.16s)]
*  He called me, he said, what I'll do, I'll tell the other soldiers that you're a Russian orphan. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8532.16s)]
*  The soldiers gave me a new name and a new birthday. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8538.16s)]
*  And so that's how I became the mascot, the good-like charm for this particular division. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8542.16s)]
*  Once the soldier convinced his unit to make Alex a Nazi, he got his own tailor-made SS uniforms, his own miniature gun, [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8548.16s)]
*  and his own rank, corporal, the youngest corporal in the Nazi army. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8556.16s)]
*  All decked out, this little Jewish boy marched off with his Nazi division. They went off to kill Jews. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8561.16s)]
*  I sometimes come into a village where we've been patrolling, and you see people being lined up to be shot in groups. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8568.16s)]
*  Then you come to another place and you see 20 or 30 people lined up to be hanged. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8577.16s)]
*  When you saw people being shot like that, did it bring back memories of your mother? [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8583.16s)]
*  Yes, I turned my head away many a time because I thought, well, you could have been one of them, [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8588.16s)]
*  and that's what happened in the place you lived, all your family. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8594.16s)]
*  Later in the war, when the Russians counterattacked and the fighting became too intense for him to stay with the soldiers, [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8599.16s)]
*  the Nazis gave Alex a new family, placing him with a prominent Nazi family in Riga, Latvia. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8605.16s)]
*  During the summers when he was seven and eight years old, [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8612.16s)]
*  Alex and his Latvian foster family spent their weekends at a beach near Riga. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8615.16s)]
*  One weekend, the Germans made a propaganda film right here starring Alex, the youngest corporal in the Nazi army, [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8620.16s)]
*  a role model for the master race, a role model who the Germans didn't realize was Jewish. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8628.16s)]
*  Did you feel funny because here were the Nazis making a film about you and you were Jewish? [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8635.16s)]
*  Exactly. All the time I felt something wrong somewhere. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8641.16s)]
*  How am I a star when I'm on the hated race? [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8645.16s)]
*  He lived in fear every day, he said, that the soldiers and later his foster family would discover he was Jewish. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8651.16s)]
*  I had to be aware every moment, doesn't matter where I was, beach, bedroom, bathroom, every moment I had to think [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8659.16s)]
*  that I'm here under false pretenses. If I'm discovered, I'm gone. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8667.16s)]
*  What did it feel like living under false pretenses 24 hours a day? [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8672.16s)]
*  Very stressful, very, very stressful. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8677.16s)]
*  What do you think would have happened if they had discovered that you were Jewish? [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8680.16s)]
*  I think there was no doubt that I would have been shot. No doubt. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8684.16s)]
*  After the war, he migrated to Australia, married and had his own family. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8689.16s)]
*  But he still kept his secrets and didn't tell his wife or his children that he'd spent the war with the Nazis or that he was Jewish. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8694.16s)]
*  He kept those secrets for more than 50 years before he felt compelled to answer the questions that had haunted him since the war. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8702.16s)]
*  I thought before I die, I should know who I am. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8710.16s)]
*  And also, I always wished to go back to the village and put a flower on my mother's grave. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8713.16s)]
*  But this wouldn't be easy. Orphaned at age six, he remembered the trauma but had long forgotten his true identity. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8720.16s)]
*  He didn't know his name or his birth date or the name of his village or where it might be. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8727.16s)]
*  The only clue he had to anything was one word that had stuck in his mind for all those years. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8732.16s)]
*  One word, Koidinov. But he had no idea what it meant. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8738.16s)]
*  Koidinov, yeah. I thought for a while it could be my surname or something, but that's what I remembered, Koidinov. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8742.16s)]
*  His son Mark made a documentary of the quest for his father's history. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8750.16s)]
*  They searched for months in dictionaries, encyclopedias and atlases until a historian finally discovered that Koidinov had been the previous name of a town in Belorussia outside Minsk. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8754.16s)]
*  With that breakthrough, he then found a half-brother he didn't know existed. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8765.16s)]
*  And when he returned to Koidinov, he found his old house which was still standing and an apple tree he used to climb. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8772.16s)]
*  This is it. It clicks everything I told him. This clicks now. I couldn't believe it. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8782.16s)]
*  You couldn't believe it? [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8790.16s)]
*  Couldn't believe it, no. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8791.16s)]
*  And then your name, you found out your name? [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8792.16s)]
*  Yeah, we found that my name was Ilja Solomonovich Kalperin. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8794.16s)]
*  His half-brother gave him a picture of their father who had died 20 years earlier. The similarity to Alex is striking. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8799.16s)]
*  Alex thought his father had been killed during the war, but he'd really been taken to a concentration camp and survived. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8807.16s)]
*  When his father returned to his village, he heard that his wife and all his children, including Alex, had been killed. So father and son had each thought the other was dead. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8814.16s)]
*  I would have liked to meet him after he came back from the concentration camps and tell him that he had a son who survived the war, but it didn't turn out that way. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8824.16s)]
*  In Koidinov, Alex fulfilled his other lifelong wish. He placed flowers at his mother's grave on a memorial to the 1600 Jews killed here by the Nazis in 1941. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8837.16s)]
*  It was my family and everybody, all my relatives, which were quite a large number, I suppose, you know, everybody. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8849.16s)]
*  Alex took us up the hill where he'd hidden behind trees that are gone now. As he'd watched his mother and hundreds of others being killed below, he told us he bit his hand to keep from screaming and that he passed out several times. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8859.16s)]
*  From the sights and from the screams and from the pain in me, the shooting went all day, all day. And I knew that I couldn't do nothing about it, but it wasn't very nice to watch either, you know. So I had the glimpse and then I turned my head and cried. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8874.16s)]
*  He used to feel guilty that he survived, but now he feels relieved that he's able to tell his story. The Jewish Claims Conference has verified it and his son wrote a book about it. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8895.16s)]
*  Still, the past is not a happy place for Alex, but he went there and came back, having found his name, his village and his mother's grave. But... [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8906.16s)]
*  Did you ever find out what your birthday is? [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8916.16s)]
*  No, I never found out, but every morning I get up, I wish myself a happy birthday and one day I'll strike it lucky. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8918.16s)]
*  I hope you get a gift every day. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8926.16s)]
*  Not a gift, a gift that I can see the sun. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8929.16s)]
*  A gift that you can see the sun. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8932.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8934.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8935.16s)]
*  Now an extraordinary story from the Second World War, a humanitarian story that didn't come to light for decades. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8946.16s)]
*  It concerns a young Londoner named Nicholas Winton who went to Prague and ended up saving the lives of 669 children, mostly Jews, from almost certain death. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8954.16s)]
*  His story begins at the end of 1938 with Europe on the brink of war. In Germany, violence against Jews was escalating and the infamous Munich Agreement paved the way for Hitler's armies to march unopposed into Czechoslovakia. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8966.16s)]
*  In London, Nicholas Winton had been following events and knew that refugees fleeing the Nazis were in dire straits. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8982.16s)]
*  He went to Czechoslovakia to see if there was anything he could do to help. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8990.16s)]
*  What's strange is that for almost 50 years he hardly told anyone about what he had accomplished. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=8995.16s)]
*  And for 50 years the children knew nothing about who had saved them or how. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9002.16s)]
*  We begin on October 1st, 1938. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9012.16s)]
*  Nazi troops marched into the Sudetenland, the German-speaking region of Czechoslovakia. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9017.16s)]
*  Prague, the Czech capital, was flooded with desperate people trying to escape. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9023.16s)]
*  A fortunate few were able to send their children abroad. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9029.16s)]
*  These parents, mostly Czech Jews, sensed war was coming and wanted to get their children out. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9033.16s)]
*  By chance, a cameraman filmed a man holding a boy, a 29-year-old Londoner. His name? Nicholas Winton. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9041.16s)]
*  All I knew was that the people that I met couldn't get out and they were looking of ways of at least getting their children out. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9050.16s)]
*  Nicholas Winton is one of the few people who can bear witness to those days because he's 104 years old. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9063.16s)]
*  He told us he went to Prague to see if he might be able to save some people. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9070.16s)]
*  But what made you think you could do it? [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9075.16s)]
*  I work on the motto that if something's not impossible there must be a way of doing it. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9078.16s)]
*  Back in London, Winton was a successful stockbroker living the good life with a passion for sports. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9084.16s)]
*  But he was deeply concerned about news reports from Czechoslovakia of German persecution. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9091.16s)]
*  I went out into the camps where the people who had been displaced were put. And it was winter and it was cold. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9097.16s)]
*  Immigration wasn't an option. The world's doors were closed to the refugees. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9110.16s)]
*  Conditions in the camps were brutal for the 150,000 people trapped there, especially for the children. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9115.16s)]
*  And no one focused on them until Nicholas Winton. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9123.16s)]
*  But what did he do? [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9127.16s)]
*  We went to Jerusalem to Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9130.16s)]
*  and asked Dr. David Silberklang, a senior historian there. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9136.16s)]
*  Winton went, set up shop in a hotel in the center of the old city in Prague, [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9140.16s)]
*  and began looking into how can I organize getting some of these refugees, particularly the children, out of here. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9145.16s)]
*  What kind of experience did he have to qualify him for this immense bureaucratic task? [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9151.16s)]
*  None. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9157.16s)]
*  Winton set up a small organization with one aim, to get as many kids out as fast as possible. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9159.16s)]
*  People started coming to him in increasing numbers. He didn't have time in the day to meet them all. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9166.16s)]
*  He'd work till two in the morning, get up early in the morning to meet the next people. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9171.16s)]
*  As more and more were coming saying, take my child, take my child. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9174.16s)]
*  By the time he returned to London, he had a list of hundreds of children, [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9177.16s)]
*  and set out to convince British authorities to take him seriously. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9182.16s)]
*  He did it by taking stationery from an established refugee organization, [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9186.16s)]
*  adding children's section, and making himself chairman. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9191.16s)]
*  So that eventually they had to adopt me. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9196.16s)]
*  So in fact, you managed to do what you did through a little deception, a little smoke and mirrors. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9199.16s)]
*  Yes, to a certain extent, yes. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9208.16s)]
*  It required quite a bit of ingenuity. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9211.16s)]
*  No, it just required a printing press to get the newspaper printed. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9214.16s)]
*  The children's section operated from a tiny office in central London. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9220.16s)]
*  Winton's mother was in charge. The staff were all volunteers. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9224.16s)]
*  During the day, Winton worked as a stockbroker. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9229.16s)]
*  Evenings, he wrestled with the British bureaucracy. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9233.16s)]
*  Did you approach any other countries to take some of the children? [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9236.16s)]
*  The Americans. But the Americans wouldn't take any. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9240.16s)]
*  Which was a pity, we could have got a lot more out. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9245.16s)]
*  Winton had written President Roosevelt asking the US to take in more children. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9249.16s)]
*  A minor official at the US Embassy in London wrote back, the US was unable to help. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9254.16s)]
*  Britain agreed to accept the children, but only if Winton found families willing to take them in. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9260.16s)]
*  So he circulated the children's pictures to advertise them. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9266.16s)]
*  But even after a family chose a child, British authorities were slow in issuing travel documents. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9270.16s)]
*  So Winton started having them forged. He also spread some money around. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9277.16s)]
*  Took a bit of blackmail on my part. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9282.16s)]
*  You were indulging in blackmail and forgery to get the children out. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9285.16s)]
*  I've never heard it put like that before. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9289.16s)]
*  But you seemed to be enjoying it. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9294.16s)]
*  It worked, that's the main thing. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9297.16s)]
*  The first 20 children left Prague on March 14, 1939. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9299.16s)]
*  The next day, German troops occupied Prague and the rest of Czechoslovakia. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9307.16s)]
*  Hitler rode through the streets, triumphant. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9312.16s)]
*  Hugo Meisel was 10 years old. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9315.16s)]
*  Do you remember the Germans coming into Czechoslovakia? [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9318.16s)]
*  Not only do I remember, I personally saw Hitler standing up in the car [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9321.16s)]
*  and the children were expected to say, hire Hitler and so forth. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9326.16s)]
*  I remember as if yesterday. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9331.16s)]
*  It wasn't long before violence against Jews, property confiscations and forced labor [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9333.16s)]
*  that began in the Sudetenland spread through our Czechoslovakia. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9339.16s)]
*  But the Nazis allowed Winton's trains to leave in keeping with their policy to cleanse Europe of Jews. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9343.16s)]
*  Hugo Meisel's parents decided it was time to put him and his brother on one of the trains. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9350.16s)]
*  I remember that they told us that we were going to England, maybe two or three months. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9356.16s)]
*  It would be a holiday for us and that they would join us very shortly thereafter. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9363.16s)]
*  And you believed them? [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9368.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9369.16s)]
*  Were your parents emotional when they said goodbye to you? [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9370.16s)]
*  No, I've asked myself that question many times. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9373.16s)]
*  How my parents had the strength. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9378.16s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9393.16s)]
*  It never occurred to me that what they were saying to us was not true. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9395.16s)]
*  In other words, that they realized that they would not be joining us within a short period of time. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9400.16s)]
*  Over the spring and summer of 1939, seven trains carried over 600 children [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9407.16s)]
*  through the heart of Nazi Germany to Holland, where they took a ferry to the English coast. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9414.16s)]
*  From there, they caught a train to London. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9420.16s)]
*  An eighth train carrying 250 more was scheduled to leave Prague on September 1st. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9423.16s)]
*  But that's the day the war began. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9430.16s)]
*  They were all at the station, even on the train waiting to go. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9433.16s)]
*  And war was declared, so the train never left. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9438.16s)]
*  Never heard really what happened to all of us. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9442.16s)]
*  But there's reason to suspect that not many of them survived. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9445.16s)]
*  I think that's true, yes. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9449.16s)]
*  Two years after that last train, the Nazis began implementing the final solution, [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9452.16s)]
*  their plan to slaughter all the Jews of Europe. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9458.16s)]
*  Czech Jews were rounded up and shipped to Theresienstadt, [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9461.16s)]
*  an old military garrison town about an hour away from the city of Lodz. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9465.16s)]
*  They were shipped to Theresienstadt, an old military garrison town about an hour north of Prague, [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9470.16s)]
*  their first stop on the road to annihilation. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9476.16s)]
*  These tracks were the exit from Theresienstadt, the only exit. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9480.16s)]
*  The tracks led east. The trains were called Polish transports, destination Auschwitz. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9485.16s)]
*  Some 90,000 people took that one-way ride. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9492.16s)]
*  Among them, almost all the children, Sir Nicholas wasn't able to get out in time. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9496.16s)]
*  Their parents and the parents of the children already in England. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9501.16s)]
*  After the war you went back to Czechoslovakia. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9506.16s)]
*  Was there one instant where you accepted the fact that your parents were dead? [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9509.16s)]
*  For three years we used to visit when trains came from Siberia, [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9515.16s)]
*  especially when the communists moved in in 1948. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9519.16s)]
*  People started coming back from Siberia. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9523.16s)]
*  So I would go to a station hoping, and when films were being shown [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9526.16s)]
*  of people walking in concentration camps, Auschwitz and so forth, [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9532.16s)]
*  there were so many shots being taken by the Germans and so forth, [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9541.16s)]
*  that I never stopped looking. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9546.16s)]
*  The name of every Czech Jew murdered in the Holocaust [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9569.16s)]
*  is painted on the walls of Prague's Pinkus Synagogue. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9572.16s)]
*  Over 77,300 names, including Arnoska and Pavel Meisel, Hugo's parents. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9576.16s)]
*  And Nicholas Winton? [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9589.16s)]
*  During the war he volunteered for an ambulance unit for the Red Cross, [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9591.16s)]
*  then trained pilots for the Royal Air Force. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9595.16s)]
*  He got married, raised a family, earned a comfortable living. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9598.16s)]
*  For 50 years he told hardly anyone what he had done. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9602.16s)]
*  A question which I know intrigues everyone who hears your story [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9607.16s)]
*  is why did you keep it secret for so long? [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9614.16s)]
*  I didn't really keep it secret, I just didn't talk about it. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9618.16s)]
*  All this time you're in England, then you go back to Czechoslovakia, [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9622.16s)]
*  then you go to Israel, you still had no idea [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9627.16s)]
*  how your departure from Czechoslovakia had been organized. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9631.16s)]
*  Absolutely no idea. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9635.16s)]
*  And you learned that by seeing it on television. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9637.16s)]
*  That's right. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9639.16s)]
*  In 1988 the BBC learned about Winton's story [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9641.16s)]
*  and invited him to be part of a program. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9645.16s)]
*  He had no idea that the people sitting around him were people he had saved. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9648.16s)]
*  Can I ask, is there anyone in our audience tonight [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9653.16s)]
*  who owes their life to Nicholas Winton? [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9656.16s)]
*  If so, could you stand up please? [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9659.16s)]
*  Mr. Winton, would you like to turn around? [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9662.16s)]
*  On behalf of all of them, thank you very much indeed. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9670.16s)]
*  I suppose it was the most emotional moment of my life, [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9683.16s)]
*  suddenly being confronted with all these children [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9688.16s)]
*  who weren't by any means children anymore. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9692.16s)]
*  No they weren't, and for the first time they looked at you [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9695.16s)]
*  and knew that you were the reason that they were alive. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9699.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9703.16s)]
*  True. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9709.16s)]
*  I wore this around my neck, and this is the actual purse [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9711.16s)]
*  that we were given to come to England. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9716.16s)]
*  And another of the children that you saved. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9719.16s)]
*  Lady Milena Grenfell-Bains describes Winton [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9724.16s)]
*  as one of the most modest people she's ever met. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9727.16s)]
*  Why do you think he didn't say anything for 50 years? [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9730.16s)]
*  I think it was in his nature. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9734.16s)]
*  He really felt that he had done all he could, [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9736.16s)]
*  having got those children settled. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9739.16s)]
*  He felt, being there, done that, my job's done, [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9741.16s)]
*  I've got other things to do. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9744.16s)]
*  Other things. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9746.16s)]
*  For the last 50 years, Winton's been helping mentally handicapped people [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9748.16s)]
*  and building homes for the elderly. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9752.16s)]
*  We've just opened our second old people's home, [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9754.16s)]
*  and it's full, and it's doing very well. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9758.16s)]
*  And there are plenty of old people like me to go in. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9764.16s)]
*  But you're not there, you're at home. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9767.16s)]
*  Oh, I'd hate to go into one of my own homes. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9769.16s)]
*  Don't print that. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9774.16s)]
*  Sir Nicholas Winton. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9778.16s)]
*  In 2003, Winton was knighted and became Sir Nicholas Winton. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9780.16s)]
*  In the Czech Republic, he's become a national hero. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9784.16s)]
*  He was celebrated in a documentary called Nicky's Family, [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9788.16s)]
*  but he isn't really comfortable with all the adulation. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9792.16s)]
*  I'm not interested in the past. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9796.16s)]
*  I think there's too much emphasis nowadays on the past and what has happened, [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9799.16s)]
*  and nobody is concentrating on the present and the future. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9807.16s)]
*  In 1939, Nicholas Winton used a two-week vacation to go to Prague [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9812.16s)]
*  and ended up saving the lives of 669 children. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9818.16s)]
*  In the decades since, of course, the children had children, [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9822.16s)]
*  who then had children and so on, and the numbers multiplied. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9826.16s)]
*  If you want to summarize it in one sentence, a guy takes a two-week vacation... [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9831.16s)]
*  And ends up with 15,000 children, yeah. Yes. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9836.16s)]
*  It's a pretty good story. It's a great story. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9840.16s)]
*  They've got children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9843.16s)]
*  And none of them would be here if it hadn't been for Sir Nick. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9847.16s)]
*  That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Terrible responsibilities. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9851.16s)]
*  It is not often you get the chance to meet a man who holds a place in history like Ben Ferenz. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9870.16s)]
*  When we first reported on him back in 2017, he was 97 years old, barely five feet tall, [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9876.16s)]
*  and he had served as prosecutor of what's been called the biggest murder trial ever. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9884.16s)]
*  The courtroom was Nuremberg, the crime genocide, and the defendants, [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9890.16s)]
*  a group of German SS officers accused of committing the largest number of Nazi killings [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9896.16s)]
*  outside the concentration camps. More than a million men, women, and children [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9902.16s)]
*  shot in their own towns and villages in cold blood. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9908.16s)]
*  Ferenz is the last Nuremberg prosecutor alive today, [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9913.16s)]
*  but he isn't content just being a part of 20th century history. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9917.16s)]
*  He believes he has something important to offer the world right now. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9922.16s)]
*  You know, you have seen the ugliest side of humanity. Yes. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9927.16s)]
*  You've really seen evil. And look at you. You're the sunniest man I've ever met. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9933.16s)]
*  The most optimistic. You want to get some more friends? [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9938.16s)]
*  Oh, this is nice. Watching Ben Ferenz during his daily swim, his gym workout, [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9943.16s)]
*  I'm showing off now. And his morning push-up regimen, [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9951.16s)]
*  100. Is to realize he isn't just the sunniest man we've ever met. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9955.16s)]
*  He may also be the fittest. Oh, he's dead. And that's just the beginning. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9960.16s)]
*  The case we present is a plea of humanity to law. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9964.16s)]
*  This is Ferenz making his opening statement in the Nuremberg courtroom 73 years ago. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9970.16s)]
*  The charges we have brought accuse the defendants of having committed crimes against humanity. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9975.16s)]
*  The Nuremberg trials after World War II were historic, [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9982.16s)]
*  the first international war crimes tribunals ever held. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9986.16s)]
*  Hitler's top lieutenants were prosecuted first. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9990.16s)]
*  Then a series of subsequent trials were mounted against other Nazi leaders, [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9993.16s)]
*  including 22 SS officers responsible for killing more than a million people, [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=9998.16s)]
*  not in concentration camps, but in towns and villages across Eastern Europe. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10003.16s)]
*  They would never have been brought to justice were it not for Ben Ferenz. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10008.16s)]
*  You look so young. I was so young. I was 27 years old. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10013.16s)]
*  Had you prosecuted trials before? Never in my life. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10019.16s)]
*  I don't recall if I'd ever been in a courtroom actually. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10023.16s)]
*  Ferenz had immigrated to the U.S. as a baby, [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10026.16s)]
*  the son of poor Jewish parents from a small town in Romania. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10029.16s)]
*  He grew up in a tough New York City neighborhood where his father found work as a janitor. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10033.16s)]
*  Ferenz learned quickly. He became the first in his family to go to college, [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10039.16s)]
*  then got a scholarship to Harvard Law School. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10044.16s)]
*  But during his first semester, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10047.16s)]
*  and he, like many classmates, raced to enlist. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10051.16s)]
*  He wanted to be a pilot, but the Army Air Corps wouldn't take him. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10055.16s)]
*  And I said, you know, you're too short. Your legs won't reach the pedals. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10060.16s)]
*  The Marines, they just looked at me and said, forget it, kid. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10063.16s)]
*  So he finished at Harvard, then enlisted as a private in the Army. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10067.16s)]
*  Part of an artillery battalion, he landed on the beach at Normandy [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10072.16s)]
*  and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10076.16s)]
*  Toward the end of the war, because of his legal training, [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10079.16s)]
*  he was transferred to a brand new unit in General Patton's Third Army, [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10082.16s)]
*  created to investigate war crimes. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10086.16s)]
*  As U.S. forces liberated concentration camps, his job was to rush in and gather evidence. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10089.16s)]
*  Ferenz told us he is still haunted by the things he saw and the stories he heard in those camps. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10096.16s)]
*  A father who, his son told me the story, his father had died just as we were entering the camp. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10103.16s)]
*  And the father had routinely saved a piece of his bread for his son, [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10111.16s)]
*  and he kept it under his arm at night. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10116.16s)]
*  He kept it under his arm at night so the other inmates wouldn't steal it, you know. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10123.16s)]
*  So you see these human stories, which are not, they're not real, they're not real, but they were real. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10128.16s)]
*  Ferenz came home, married his childhood sweetheart, and vowed never to set foot in Germany again. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10137.16s)]
*  But that didn't last long. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10144.16s)]
*  General Telford Taylor, in charge of the Nuremberg Trials, [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10146.16s)]
*  asked him to direct a team of researchers in Berlin, [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10150.16s)]
*  one of whom found a cache of top-secret documents in the ruins of the German Foreign Ministry. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10154.16s)]
*  They gave me a bunch of binders, four binders, and these were daily reports from the Eastern Front, [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10160.16s)]
*  which unit entered which town, how many people they killed. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10167.16s)]
*  It's classified, so many Jews, so many gypsies, so many others. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10171.16s)]
*  Ferenz had stumbled upon reports sent back to headquarters by secret SS units called Einsatzgruppen, or action groups. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10176.16s)]
*  Their job had been to follow the German army as it invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10185.16s)]
*  and kill communists, gypsies, and especially Jews. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10191.16s)]
*  There were 3,000 SS officers trained for the purpose and directed to kill, without pity or remorse, [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10195.16s)]
*  every single Jewish man, woman, and child they could lay their hands on. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10203.16s)]
*  So they went right in after the troops. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10207.16s)]
*  Come behind the troops, round up the Jews, kill them all. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10209.16s)]
*  Only one piece of film is known to exist of the Einsatzgruppen at work. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10213.16s)]
*  It isn't easy to watch. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10218.16s)]
*  This footage came to light years later. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10238.16s)]
*  At the time, Ferenz just had the documents, and he started adding up the numbers. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10241.16s)]
*  When I reached over a million people, murdered that way, over a million people, [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10246.16s)]
*  it's more people than you've ever seen in your life. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10250.16s)]
*  I took a sample, I got on the next plane, flew from Berlin down to Nuremberg, [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10253.16s)]
*  and I said to Taylor, General, we've got to put on a new trial. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10257.16s)]
*  But the trials were already underway, and prosecution staff was stretched thin. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10261.16s)]
*  Taylor told Ferenz adding another trial was impossible. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10266.16s)]
*  And I started screaming. I said, look, I've got here mass murder, [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10270.16s)]
*  mass murder on a parallel scale. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10273.16s)]
*  And he said, can you do this in addition to your other work? [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10276.16s)]
*  And I said, sure. He said, okay, so you do it. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10278.16s)]
*  And that's how 27-year-old Ben Ferenz became the chief prosecutor [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10281.16s)]
*  of 22 Einsatzgruppen commanders at trial number nine at Nuremberg. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10286.16s)]
*  How do you plead to this indictment, guilty or not guilty? [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10292.16s)]
*  Nicht schuldig. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10296.16s)]
*  Stand der Rute. Nicht schuldig. Not guilty. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10297.16s)]
*  Guilty or not guilty? [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10300.16s)]
*  Nicht schuldig. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10302.16s)]
*  They all say not guilty. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10303.16s)]
*  Same thing. Not guilty. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10304.16s)]
*  But Ferenz knew they were guilty and could prove it. [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10306.16s)]
*  Without calling a single witness, he entered into evidence [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10310.16s)]
*  the defendant's own reports of what they had done. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10313.16s)]
*  Exhibit 111. In the last 10 weeks, we have liquidated around 55,000 Jews. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10317.16s)]
*  Exhibit 179 from Kiev in 1941. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10324.16s)]
*  The Jews of the city were ordered to present themselves. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10328.16s)]
*  About 34,000 reported, including women and children. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10331.16s)]
*  After they had been made to give up their clothing and valuables, [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10336.16s)]
*  all of them were killed, which took several days. [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10339.16s)]
*  Exhibit 84 from Einsatzgruppen D in March of 1942. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10344.16s)]
*  Total number executed so far, 91,678. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10349.16s)]
*  Einsatzgruppen D was the unit of Ferenz's lead defendant Otto Ohlendorf. [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10355.16s)]
*  He didn't deny the killings. [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10360.16s)]
*  He had the gall to claim they were done in self-defense. [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10362.16s)]
*  He was not ashamed of that. He was proud of that. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10366.16s)]
*  He was carrying out his government's instructions. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10369.16s)]
*  How did you not hit him? [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10372.16s)]
*  There was only one time I wanted to really... [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10374.16s)]
*  One of these, my defendant, he gets up and he says, [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10378.16s)]
*  Was Juden erschossen? Das Hirsch hier zum ersten Mal. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10382.16s)]
*  Which is, what? The Jews were shot? I hear it here for the first time. [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10386.16s)]
*  Boy, I felt if I'd had a bayonet, I would have jumped over the thing [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10391.16s)]
*  and put a bayonet right through one ear and let it come out the other. [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10394.16s)]
*  You know? Son of a bitch. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10397.16s)]
*  I've got his reports of how many he killed, you know? [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10400.16s)]
*  An innocent lamb. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10404.16s)]
*  Did you look at the defendant's faces? [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10406.16s)]
*  Defendants' faces were blank all the time. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10408.16s)]
*  Defendants absolutely blank. They could like this. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10411.16s)]
*  They're waiting for a bus. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10414.16s)]
*  What was going on inside of you? [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10416.16s)]
*  Of me? Yeah. [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10418.16s)]
*  I'm still churning. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10420.16s)]
*  To this minute. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10423.16s)]
*  I'm still churning. [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10430.16s)]
*  All 22 defendants were found guilty, [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10432.16s)]
*  and four of them, including Ohlendorf, were hanged. [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10435.16s)]
*  Forenz says his goal from the beginning was to affirm the rule of law [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10439.16s)]
*  and deter similar crimes from ever being committed again. [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10444.16s)]
*  Did you meet a lot of people who perpetrated war crimes [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10448.16s)]
*  who would otherwise, in your opinion, have been just a normal, [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10452.16s)]
*  upstanding citizen? [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10456.16s)]
*  Yes, is my answer. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10458.16s)]
*  These men would never have been murderers had it not been for the war. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10460.16s)]
*  These were people who could quote Goethe, who loved Wagner, who were polite. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10463.16s)]
*  What turns a man into a savage beast like that? [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10469.16s)]
*  He's not a savage. He's an intelligent, patriotic human being. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10473.16s)]
*  He's a savage when he does the murder, though. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10476.16s)]
*  No, he's a patriotic human being acting in the interest of his country in his mind. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10478.16s)]
*  You don't think they turn into savages even for the act? [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10484.16s)]
*  You think the man who dropped the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima was a savage? [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10487.16s)]
*  Now I will tell you something very profound, which I have learned after many years. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10492.16s)]
*  War makes murderers out of otherwise decent people. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10497.16s)]
*  All wars and all decent people. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10502.16s)]
*  So Forenz has spent the rest of his life trying to deter war and war crimes [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10506.16s)]
*  by establishing an international court like Nuremberg. [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10512.16s)]
*  He scored a victory when the International Criminal Court in The Hague was created in 1998. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10516.16s)]
*  May it please your honors. [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10522.16s)]
*  He delivered the closing argument in the court's first case. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10524.16s)]
*  Now you've been at this for 50 years, if not more. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10528.16s)]
*  We've had genocide since then and Cambodia going on right this minute. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10532.16s)]
*  Going on right this minute. In Sudan we've had Rwanda, we've had Bosnia. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10536.16s)]
*  You're not getting very far. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10540.16s)]
*  Well, don't say that. People get discouraged. [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10542.16s)]
*  They should remember from me, it takes courage not to be discouraged. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10545.16s)]
*  Did anybody ever say that you're naive? [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10549.16s)]
*  Of course. Some people say I'm crazy. [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10552.16s)]
*  Are you naive here? [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10555.16s)]
*  Well, if it's naive to want peace instead of war, let them make sure they say I'm naive. [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10556.16s)]
*  Because I want peace instead of war. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10561.16s)]
*  If they tell me they want war instead of peace, I don't say they're naive. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10563.16s)]
*  I say they're stupid. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10566.16s)]
*  Stupid to an incredible degree to send young people out to kill other young people they don't even know. [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10568.16s)]
*  Who never did anybody any harm. Never harmed them. [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10574.16s)]
*  That is the current system. I am naive. That's insane. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10577.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10582.16s)]
*  Ferenz is legendary in the world of international law and he's still at it. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10584.16s)]
*  Are you going to help me save the world? [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10589.16s)]
*  I hope so. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10591.16s)]
*  It's up to you. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10592.16s)]
*  He never stops pushing his message. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10593.16s)]
*  No, not war. Never give up. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10595.16s)]
*  Never give up. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10597.16s)]
*  And he's donating much of his savings to a genocide prevention initiative at the Holocaust Museum. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10598.16s)]
*  He says he's grateful for the life he's lived in this country and it's his turn to give back. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10605.16s)]
*  You are such an idealist. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10611.16s)]
*  I don't think I'm an idealist. I'm a realist. And I see the progress. The progress has been remarkable. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10613.16s)]
*  Look at the emancipation of women in my lifetime. You're sitting here as a female. [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10618.16s)]
*  Look what's happened to the same sex marriages. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10622.16s)]
*  You have to tell somebody a man can become a woman, a woman can become a man, and a man can marry a man. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10624.16s)]
*  They always say you're crazy. But it's a reality today. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10629.16s)]
*  So the world is changing and you shouldn't be despairing because it's never happened before. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10632.16s)]
*  Nothing will ever happen before. But we're on a roll. We're marching forward. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10639.16s)]
*  Ben, I'm sitting here listening to you and you're very wise and you're full of energy and passion. [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10643.16s)]
*  And I can't believe you're 97 years old. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10649.16s)]
*  Well, I'm still a young man. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10652.16s)]
*  Clearly. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10655.16s)]
*  And I'm still in there fighting. And you know what keeps me going? I know I'm right. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10656.16s)]
*  This year marks the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II and the liberation of concentration camps across Europe. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10669.16s)]
*  Most of the survivors who remain are now in their 80s and 90s. [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10678.16s)]
*  So soon there will be no one left to experience the horrors of the Holocaust firsthand. [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10683.16s)]
*  No one to answer questions or bear witness to future generations. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10689.16s)]
*  But as we first reported earlier this year, a new and dramatic effort is underway to change that [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10695.16s)]
*  by harnessing the technologies of the present and the future to keep alive the ability to talk to and get answers from the past. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10703.16s)]
*  Hi, Aaron. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10714.16s)]
*  Hello. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10716.16s)]
*  Can I ask you some questions? [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10718.16s)]
*  You can ask me anything you want. Within reason. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10720.16s)]
*  Our interview with Holocaust survivor Aaron Elster, who spent two years of his childhood hidden in a neighbor's attic, was unlike any interview we have ever done. [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10725.16s)]
*  Aaron, tell us what your parents did before the war. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10736.16s)]
*  They owned and operated a butcher shop. [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10741.16s)]
*  It wasn't the content of the interview that was so unusual. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10744.16s)]
*  Where did you live? [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10748.16s)]
*  I was born in a small town in Poland called Sokov Podlasky. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10750.16s)]
*  It's the fact that this interview was with a man who was no longer alive. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10755.16s)]
*  Aaron Elster died two years ago. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10761.16s)]
*  What's the weather like today? [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10764.16s)]
*  I'm actually recording. I cannot answer that question. [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10766.16s)]
*  The survivors were getting very old. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10771.16s)]
*  Heather Mayo came up with the idea for this project. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10774.16s)]
*  She had worked on exhibits featuring Holocaust survivors for years and wanted future generations to have the same opportunity to interact with them as she'd had. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10777.16s)]
*  I wanted to talk to a Holocaust survivor like I would today with that person sitting right in front of me and we were having a conversation. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10788.16s)]
*  She knew that back in the 90s. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10800.16s)]
*  After making the film Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg created a foundation named for the Hebrew word for the Holocaust, Shoah, [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10803.16s)]
*  to film and collect testimonies from as many survivors as possible. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10812.16s)]
*  They have interviewed nearly 55,000 of them so far and have steward them at the University of Southern California. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10818.16s)]
*  But Mayo dreamed of something more dynamic, being able to actively converse with survivors after they're gone. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10827.16s)]
*  And she figured in the age of artificial intelligence tools like Siri and Alexa, the technology had to be createable. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10835.16s)]
*  I've been involved in interviewing Holocaust survivors for over 20 years. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10844.16s)]
*  She brought the idea to Steven Smith, executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation, and now her husband. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10847.16s)]
*  He loved it, but some of his colleagues weren't so sure. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10855.16s)]
*  One of them looked at me and she was like, you want to talk to dead people? [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10859.16s)]
*  And you said yes because that's the point. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10864.16s)]
*  That's the point. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10867.16s)]
*  Well maybe people thought you're turning the Holocaust into something maybe hokey. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10868.16s)]
*  Yeah, they said that you're going to Disney-fy the Holocaust. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10873.16s)]
*  We had a lot of pushback on this project. Is it the right thing to do? [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10878.16s)]
*  What about the well-being of the survivors? Are we trying to keep them alive beyond their death? [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10881.16s)]
*  Everyone had questions except for one group of people, the survivors themselves, who said, where do I sign up? [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10885.16s)]
*  I would like to participate in this project. No barriers to entry. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10891.16s)]
*  The first survivor they signed up to do a trial run was a man named Pinkus Guter, [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10896.16s)]
*  who was born in Poland and deported to the Majdanek concentration camp with his parents and twin sister Sabina at the age of 11. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10903.16s)]
*  He's the only one who survived. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10912.16s)]
*  They flew Pinkus from his home in Toronto to Los Angeles and asked him to sit inside this. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10915.16s)]
*  So you're in this dome? [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10923.16s)]
*  Yeah, I call it the sphere, they call it the dome, and then eventually it's called a bubble. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10925.16s)]
*  A bubble surrounding him with lights and more than 20 cameras. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10930.16s)]
*  What's our F-stop? [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10935.16s)]
*  The goal was to future-proof the interviews so that as technology advances and 3D hologram-like projection becomes the norm, they'll have all the necessary angles. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10936.16s)]
*  So the very first day we went to film Pinkus, we had these ultra-high-speed cameras that were all linked together and synced together to make this video of him. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10949.16s)]
*  So we sat down and they pressed record, nothing happens. [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10957.16s)]
*  So Pinkus is sitting there with 6,000 LED lights on him and cameras that don't work. [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10961.16s)]
*  Can I go back to sleep now? [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10966.16s)]
*  Sunglasses shielded his eyes. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10968.16s)]
*  When are we going to start? I was bored sitting in that chair, so I started singing to myself. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10970.16s)]
*  So suddenly Steven had this idea, oh he's singing, we're going to record some songs of his. [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10980.16s)]
*  He was such a good sport. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10986.16s)]
*  He was a really good sport. [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10989.16s)]
*  Eventually the cameras rolled and Pinkus was asked to come back to the bubble for the real thing. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10991.16s)]
*  How long were you in that chair? [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=10998.16s)]
*  A whole week from 9 to 5. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11000.16s)]
*  A week? [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11002.16s)]
*  We were there with breaks for lunch, but I was there from 9 to 5 answering questions. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11003.16s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11007.16s)]
*  It took so long because they asked him nearly 2,000 questions. [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11008.16s)]
*  The idea was to cover every conceivable question anyone might ever want to ask him. [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11014.16s)]
*  Did you have to look exactly the same? [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11020.16s)]
*  I had to wear the same clothes and I had three pairs of the same jackets, the same shirts, the same trousers, the same shoes. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11023.16s)]
*  Every morning... [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11033.16s)]
*  Pinkus can now be seen in those shirts, trousers and shoes at Holocaust museums in Dallas, Indiana, [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11034.16s)]
*  and here at the Illinois Holocaust Museum in Skokie outside Chicago, where visitors can ask him their own questions. [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11042.16s)]
*  What kept you going or what gave you hope while you were experiencing hardship in the camps? [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11051.16s)]
*  We did hope that the Nazis would lose the war. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11055.16s)]
*  Pinkus' image is projected onto an 11-foot high screen. [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11059.16s)]
*  What we see here... [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11064.16s)]
*  Smith joined us to explain how the technology works. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11065.16s)]
*  So what's happening is all of the answers to the questions that Pinkus gave go into a database. [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11069.16s)]
*  Then when you ask a question, the algorithm is looking through all of the database. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11074.16s)]
*  Do I have an answer to that? [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11078.16s)]
*  And then it will bring back what it thinks is the closest answer to your question. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11080.16s)]
*  I'm going to try talking to Pinkus. [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11084.16s)]
*  Yes. [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11086.16s)]
*  Did you have a happy childhood? [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11087.16s)]
*  I had a very happy childhood. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11089.16s)]
*  My parents were winemakers. [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11091.16s)]
*  My father started teaching me to become a winemaker when I was three and a half years old. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11093.16s)]
*  By the age of five, I could already read and I could already write. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11098.16s)]
*  Wow. You're very smart. [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11102.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11106.16s)]
*  I've noticed there's a little jiggle right before Pinkus starts to talk. What is that? [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11108.16s)]
*  What you're seeing here isn't a human being. [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11114.16s)]
*  It's video clips that are being buttered up to each other and played. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11116.16s)]
*  And as it searches and brings the clip in, you're seeing a little bit of a jump cut. [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11120.16s)]
*  The jump cuts stop being distracting once we started talking about the fate of Pinkus' family. [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11125.16s)]
*  Tell us what happened when you got to the camp. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11132.16s)]
*  As soon as we arrived there, we were being separated into different groups. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11136.16s)]
*  And my sister was somehow pushed towards the children. [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11142.16s)]
*  And I saw her. She must have spotted my mother. [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11148.16s)]
*  So she ran towards my mother. I saw my mother. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11151.16s)]
*  And she hugged her. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11155.16s)]
*  And since that time, all I can remember whenever I think of my sister is her long, big, long blonde braid. [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11158.16s)]
*  That was the last time he saw his twin sister Sabina. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11171.16s)]
*  He learned later that day that she and both his parents had been killed in the gas chambers. [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11176.16s)]
*  Pinkus was alone at age 11, put to work as a slave laborer. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11182.16s)]
*  Did you ever see anybody killed? [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11188.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, I saw many people die in front of my eyes. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11191.16s)]
*  I wasn't sure how a recording would handle what I wanted to ask Pinkus next. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11195.16s)]
*  How can you still have faith in God? [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11201.16s)]
*  How can you possibly not believe in God? [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11206.16s)]
*  Well, how did he let this happen? [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11209.16s)]
*  God gave human beings the knowledge of right and wrong. [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11211.16s)]
*  And he allowed them to do what they wished on this earth, to find their own way. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11218.16s)]
*  To my mind, when God sees what human beings are up to, especially things like genocide, he weeps. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11225.16s)]
*  Wow. [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11234.16s)]
*  Stephen, I could ask him questions for 10 hours. [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11236.16s)]
*  And on the screen. [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11240.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11243.16s)]
*  Since Pinkus Guter was filmed, the Shoah Foundation has recorded interviews with 21 more Holocaust survivors, [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11244.16s)]
*  each for a full week. [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11252.16s)]
*  And they've shrunk the setup required so they can take a mobile rig on the road to record survivors close to where they live. [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11254.16s)]
*  They've deliberately chosen interview subjects with all different wartime experiences. [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11263.16s)]
*  Survivors of Auschwitz, hidden children, and as we saw last fall in New Jersey, [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11269.16s)]
*  93-year-old Alan Moskin, who isn't a Holocaust survivor, he was a liberator. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11276.16s)]
*  Entering that camp was the most horrific sight I've ever seen or ever hoped to see the rest of my life. [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11285.16s)]
*  Moskin was an 18-year-old private when his army unit liberated a little-known concentration camp called Gunskirchen. [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11292.16s)]
*  There was a pile of skeleton-like bodies on the left. There was another pile of skeleton-like bodies on the right. [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11301.16s)]
*  Those poor souls, that's the term my lieutenant kept screaming, oh my God, look at these poor souls. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11307.16s)]
*  Each of Alan Moskin's answers is then isolated by a team of researchers at the Shoah Foundation office. [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11314.16s)]
*  I remember the expression and the attitude of all of us, what in the freak, what is this God almighty? [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11321.16s)]
*  Who add into the system a variety of questions people might ask to trigger that response. [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11327.16s)]
*  For every question that we asked, there are 15 different ways of asking the same question. [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11334.16s)]
*  And that's fed in. [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11340.16s)]
*  And that's all manual. [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11341.16s)]
*  Editors rotate the image, turn the green screen background into black, and then a long process of testing begins, some of it in schools. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11343.16s)]
*  So, Mr. Pincus, on your screen. [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11354.16s)]
*  Students are asked to try it out, ask whatever questions they want, and see if the system calls up the correct answer. [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11357.16s)]
*  How did you find out that your city was getting invaded by Germany? [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11365.16s)]
*  Would you ever want to seek revenge? [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11369.16s)]
*  How did you feel about your family? [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11371.16s)]
*  Can you rephrase that, please? [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11373.16s)]
*  Every question and response is then reviewed. [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11376.16s)]
*  We log every single question that's asked of the system and see if there is a better response that addresses that question more directly. [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11379.16s)]
*  As we discovered, it's still a work in progress. [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11388.16s)]
*  Tell us about your family when you were a little boy. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11392.16s)]
*  How about you ask me about life after the war? [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11395.16s)]
*  So a couple of things about artificial intelligence. [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11400.16s)]
*  It is mainly artificial and not so intelligent. [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11402.16s)]
*  Just yet, for now. [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11406.16s)]
*  But the beauty of artificial intelligence is it develops over time. [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11408.16s)]
*  So we aren't changing the content. [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11412.16s)]
*  All the answers remain the same. [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11414.16s)]
*  But over time, the range of questions that you can ask will be enhanced considerably. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11416.16s)]
*  And you had to stay silent? [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11422.16s)]
*  Questions to draw out what it was like for Aaron Elster hiding in that attic 75 years ago. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11424.16s)]
*  I used to pray to God to let me live till I was 25. [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11432.16s)]
*  I wanted to taste what adulthood would be like. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11435.16s)]
*  The rest of that conversation with Aaron Elster, as well as one with a survivor of Joseph Mengele's infamous twin experiments at Auschwitz, when we come back. [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11438.16s)]
*  So am I a lucky guy? [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11450.16s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11454.16s)]
*  The whole point of the Shoah Foundation's project is to allow meaningful conversations with Holocaust survivors to continue even after the survivors themselves are gone. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11467.16s)]
*  And of the more than 20 men and women who have participated so far, four have passed away already. [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11479.16s)]
*  Tonight, we wanted to share conversations with two of them. [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11487.16s)]
*  Conversations that at times felt so normal, we could almost forget we were talking to the digital image of someone who was no longer living. [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11491.16s)]
*  First, a spunky four foot nine woman named Eva Kaur, an identical twin who together with her sisters survived Auschwitz and the notorious experiments of Dr. Joseph Mengele. [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11501.16s)]
*  Eva Kaur spent her life after the war in Terre Haute, Indiana. [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11515.16s)]
*  She died last summer at the age of 85. [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11521.16s)]
*  Hi, Eva. [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11525.16s)]
*  How are you today? [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11527.16s)]
*  I'm fine. And how are you? [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11529.16s)]
*  I'm good. [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11531.16s)]
*  It felt natural to answer her question before posing my own. [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11533.16s)]
*  So how old were you when you went to Auschwitz? [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11537.16s)]
*  When I arrived in Auschwitz, I was 10 years old. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11541.16s)]
*  And I stayed in Auschwitz until liberation, which was about nine months later than we were liberated. [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11546.16s)]
*  So we made a little announcement about the fact we were starting this project. [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11555.16s)]
*  I get a call the next day from a lady called Eva Kaur. [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11560.16s)]
*  I didn't know her at that point in time. [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11563.16s)]
*  And she says, I want to be one of those 3D interviews. [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11565.16s)]
*  I want to be a hologram. [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11568.16s)]
*  Stephen Smith, executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation, and his wife and colleague, Heather Mayo Smith, were running the project. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11570.16s)]
*  I said, well, I'm traveling. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11580.16s)]
*  I'm very sorry. [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11582.16s)]
*  Sorry. Where are you going? [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11583.16s)]
*  Well, I've got to go to New York. I'm going to D.C. [[03:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11585.16s)]
*  When are you going to go to D.C.? [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11587.16s)]
*  I'm going to D.C. [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11588.16s)]
*  Turns out we were going to the same event in D.C. [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11589.16s)]
*  I arrive at my hotel. [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11592.16s)]
*  She's sitting in the lobby waiting for me. [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11594.16s)]
*  When Eva on the right and her twin sister, Miriam, arrived at Auschwitz, they were pulled away from their parents and older sisters and taken to a barrack full of twins. [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11598.16s)]
*  They never saw their family again. [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11610.16s)]
*  Fifty years ago at a railroad site... [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11613.16s)]
*  Sixty minutes reported on Mengele's twin experiments in a story back in 1992. [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11615.16s)]
*  And the reason that my number is not... [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11621.16s)]
*  And we actually interviewed the living Eva Kaur at her home in Terre Haute. [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11623.16s)]
*  Eva told us then about becoming extremely sick after an injection. [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11629.16s)]
*  Mengele came in every morning and every evening with four other doctors, and he declared very sarcastically laughing, too bad. [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11634.16s)]
*  She's so young. She has only two weeks to live. [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11645.16s)]
*  When I heard that, I knew he was right. And I immediately made a silent pledge that I would prove you, Dr. Mengele, wrong. [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11649.16s)]
*  Imagine picking up a conversation almost 30 years later and after Eva's death. [[03:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11662.16s)]
*  Eva, tell us about Dr. Mengele. What was he like? [[03:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11670.16s)]
*  He had a gorgeous face, a movie star face, and very pleasant, actually. Dark hair, dark eyes. [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11674.16s)]
*  When I looked into his eyes, I could see nothing but evil. [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11683.16s)]
*  People say that the eyes are the center of the soul, and in Mengele's case, that was correct. [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11689.16s)]
*  Eva and Miriam are visible in footage taken by the Soviet forces that liberated Auschwitz 75 years ago. [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11697.16s)]
*  They went back to the camp many times, Eva continuing to go even after Miriam's death in 1993. [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11706.16s)]
*  Because if the train came in that direction... [[03:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11715.16s)]
*  It was on one of those visits that Eva made a stunning announcement... [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11717.16s)]
*  I, Eva Mozes Kor... [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11722.16s)]
*  That she had decided to forgive her Nazi captors. [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11724.16s)]
*  Hereby give amnesty to all Nazis who participated... [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11729.16s)]
*  She came under blistering attack from other survivors. [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11734.16s)]
*  How can you forgive? How is that possible? [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11739.16s)]
*  My forgiveness does not mean that I forget what happened, which is impossible. [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11743.16s)]
*  My forgiveness is an act of self-healing, self-liberation, and self-empowerment. [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11748.16s)]
*  Are you able to forgive, Aaron? [[03:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11756.16s)]
*  I cannot forgive. [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11759.16s)]
*  Aaron Elster disagrees. [[03:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11761.16s)]
*  For them to get forgiveness, they have to ask my little sister, Sarah, whom they brutally murdered. [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11763.16s)]
*  I have no right to forgive, and I will not forgive. [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11772.16s)]
*  What's important for me in this project is that we have Holocaust survivors who have different points of view about God and religion and faith and forgiveness. [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11777.16s)]
*  And that's what this project will allow us to do. [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11785.16s)]
*  Aaron Elster, unlike many Holocaust survivors, never spent time in a concentration camp. [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11788.16s)]
*  As Jews were being rounded up in his town's marketplace and sent to Treblinka, [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11794.16s)]
*  his father told him to run. He was nine years old. [[03:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11800.16s)]
*  And I managed to crawl into the sewer that ran along the marketplace, the street, and kept crawling until I felt I was out of sight. [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11805.16s)]
*  I stood up and started running. [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11813.16s)]
*  He made it to the building of an older Polish couple named the Gurskis, who'd been customers at his family's butcher shop. [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11816.16s)]
*  He shows up and she didn't want to take him. [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11824.16s)]
*  He started crying, and then she led him upstairs. [[03:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11829.16s)]
*  Aaron, how long did you stay in the attic? [[03:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11833.16s)]
*  I lived in that attic for close to two years. [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11837.16s)]
*  Two years with just one visit a day to bring food and water. [[03:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11840.16s)]
*  What was it like in the attic? [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11846.16s)]
*  Oh, there's so many things that I remember. The hunger, the fear, the absolute total loneliness. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11848.16s)]
*  What do you do all day? You're sitting there. [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11858.16s)]
*  I used to catch flies out of desperation to tear their wings off so they wouldn't fly away. So I hid them there. [[03:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11861.16s)]
*  How did you survive? How did you survive in that attic? [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11869.16s)]
*  I had the ability to daydream. I used to write novels in my head. [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11875.16s)]
*  I was the hero all the time. [[03:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11882.16s)]
*  And we have that ability to either give in to our misery and our pain and die, [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11885.16s)]
*  or absorb the physical pain but keep your mentality, keep your soul, keep your mind. [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11895.16s)]
*  So was I bored? Was I scared? Was I in need of somebody to accept me or to tell me that I'm okay, that I'm a nice kid? [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11902.16s)]
*  Sure. But that was not part of my life. [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11915.16s)]
*  We got a phone call to say that Aaron Elster had suddenly passed away. [[03:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11920.16s)]
*  I was at a conference at that time. [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11924.16s)]
*  The next morning I went into the little room that we had and I turned on Aaron Elster's testimony. [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11926.16s)]
*  And I realized I was going to be the first person ever to click that little button and ask a question of somebody who was no longer alive. [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11934.16s)]
*  And for the next six hours people came in and out of that room. His funeral had not yet taken place. [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11943.16s)]
*  And yet the legacy was already continuing and it was a very powerful and touching moment. [[03:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11949.16s)]
*  You're good. You're doing great. [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11955.16s)]
*  A touching moment that may soon be available to others beyond the community of Holocaust survivors. [[03:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11957.16s)]
*  They're going to come in and they're going to have you look. [[03:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11964.16s)]
*  Heather Mayo-Smith says in the process of developing and testing this technology she was barraged with inquiries. [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11967.16s)]
*  There wasn't one person, literally not one, that didn't ask me if they could do a similar interview [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11975.16s)]
*  with either a loved one or themselves. [[03:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11982.16s)]
*  Unrelated to the Holocaust? [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11985.16s)]
*  Unrelated, completely unrelated. Can I do this with someone that I know? [[03:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11986.16s)]
*  What's the answer? [[03:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11990.16s)]
*  Yes. [[03:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11991.16s)]
*  She has started an independent company that's trying to expand the use of this technology. [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11993.16s)]
*  I was an astronaut for NASA. [[03:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=11999.16s)]
*  Recording interviews with other historical figures like astronauts and eventually with anyone at all. [[03:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12001.16s)]
*  What unit were you in during World War II? [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12008.16s)]
*  So do you think that this is just going to be a tool that people use? [[03:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12010.16s)]
*  Everybody will be recording their histories. [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12015.16s)]
*  Interactivity. [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12017.16s)]
*  And other people can interview them. [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12018.16s)]
*  It'll just be life. [[03:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12020.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12022.16s)]
*  We're going to go ahead and get started. [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12023.16s)]
*  For now though, the race is on to capture interviews with as many Holocaust survivors as possible while there's still time [[03:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12025.16s)]
*  so the conversations can continue always with people like Aaron Elster. [[03:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12034.16s)]
*  Do you want revenge? [[03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12040.16s)]
*  When I was a youngster I wanted revenge very, very, very much. [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12042.16s)]
*  And I hate it. I hate it. [[03:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12047.16s)]
*  But most of the perpetrators, most of the killers are dead. [[03:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12052.16s)]
*  So who am I going to hate? [[03:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12056.16s)]
*  The grandchildren that had nothing to do with? [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12058.16s)]
*  That's not right. Revenge is not part of my life. Not part of my thinking. [[03:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12062.16s)]
*  You know, here you have these people who were basically destined to be annihilated. [[03:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12068.16s)]
*  That they survived as a miracle. [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12076.16s)]
*  But they were supposed to be murdered, killed. [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12078.16s)]
*  And now they have immortality. [[03:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12081.16s)]
*  They were not supposed to have a name. [[03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12083.16s)]
*  They were supposed to be destroyed for all time. [[03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12085.16s)]
*  And now through this program they will be able to continue to answer questions hundreds of years after the Nazis have gone. [[03:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12088.16s)]
*  It's that never forget. [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12095.16s)]
*  We've had a lot of cliches around the Holocaust. [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12097.16s)]
*  Never again, never forget. We must remember all this sort of thing. [[03:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12099.16s)]
*  What this does, it makes sure that there isn't closure. [[03:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12102.16s)]
*  Because it's not about a statement. [[03:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12105.16s)]
*  It's not about a particular thing that's being instructed of you. [[03:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12107.16s)]
*  The onus is on you to ask the questions. [[03:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12110.16s)]
*  The onus is on you to be curious and to want to know. [[03:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12112.16s)]
*  And so in a sense it turns the learning on its head and says, [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12117.16s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you what the lessons of the Holocaust are. [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12120.16s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you what the Holocaust means. [[03:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12123.16s)]
*  But if you want to find out, then you can ask. [[03:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12125.16s)]
*  It's so terribly important. [[03:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12128.16s)]
*  So there we were at a special moment in time when the living Pinker Scooter could talk to the one who will live forever. [[03:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12130.16s)]
*  Would you ask you a question for us? [[03:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12140.16s)]
*  I will ask the one which is my favorite. [[03:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12142.16s)]
*  OK. [[03:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12144.16s)]
*  Can you sing me a song from your youth? [[03:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12145.16s)]
*  You want me to sing it for you? [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12147.16s)]
*  Yes, please. [[03:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12149.16s)]
*  What does that mean? What is the song? Is it a happy song? [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12164.16s)]
*  Yes, it's a happy song. It's like a brother and a sister, which of course my twin sister, [[03:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12167.16s)]
*  are traveling in the woods or on the road and they can't get over how beautiful the world is. [[03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wA4dn_KTg&t=12173.16s)]
