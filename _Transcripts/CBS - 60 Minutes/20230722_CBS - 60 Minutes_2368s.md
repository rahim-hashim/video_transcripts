# Nuclear Fusion Breakthrough; Powering Electric Vehicles; Carbon Capture | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng)
*  Last month, the nearest star to the Earth was in California. In a laboratory for the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=0.0s)]
*  first time, the world's largest lasers forced atoms of hydrogen to fuse together in the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  same kind of energy-producing reaction that fires the Sun. It lasted less than a billionth [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=25.76s)]
*  of a second, but after six decades of toil and failure, the Lawrence Livermore National [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=32.2s)]
*  Laboratory proved it could be done. If fusion becomes commercial power one day, it would be [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  endless and carbon-free. In other words, it would change human destiny. As you'll see, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=44.88s)]
*  there's far to go, but after December's breakthrough, we were invited to tour the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=51.72s)]
*  lab and meet the team that brought star power down to Earth. Uncontrolled fusion is easy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=57.04s)]
*  Mastered so long ago, the films are in black and white. Fusion is what a hydrogen bomb does, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=67.68s)]
*  releasing energy by forcing atoms of hydrogen to fuse together. What's been impossible is [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=74.84s)]
*  harnessing the fires of Armageddon into something useful. The U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=82.4s)]
*  Livermore National Laboratory helps maintain nuclear weapons and experiments with high-energy [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=90.5s)]
*  physics. An hour east of San Francisco, we met Livermore's director, Kim Budell, in the lab that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=97.0s)]
*  made history, the National Ignition Facility. The National Ignition Facility is the world's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=105.28s)]
*  largest, most energetic laser. It was built starting in the 1990s to create conditions in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=111.4s)]
*  the laboratory that had previously only been accessible in the most extreme objects in the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  universe, like the center of giant planets or the sun, or in operating nuclear weapons. And the goal [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=122.4s)]
*  was to really be able to study that kind of very high-energy, high-density condition in a lot of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=128.6s)]
*  detail. The National Ignition Facility, or NIF, was built for three and a half billion dollars to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=134.4s)]
*  ignite self-sustaining fusion. They tried nearly 200 times over 13 years, but like a car with a [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=142.12s)]
*  weak battery, the atomic engine would never turn over. NIF drew some nicknames. It did for many [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=150.4s)]
*  years, the not-ignition facility, the never-ignition facility, more recently the nearly-ignition [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=159.32s)]
*  facility. So this recent event has really put the ignition in the NIF. Ignition means igniting a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=165.76s)]
*  fusion reaction that puts out more energy than the lasers put in. So if you can get it hot enough, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=173.28s)]
*  dense enough, fast enough, and hold it together long enough, the fusion reactions start to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=180.08s)]
*  self-sustain. And that's really what happened here on December 5th. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  Main laser operation will begin in approximately one minute. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  Last month, the laser shot fired from this control room put two units of energy into the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  experiment. Atoms began fusing and about three units of energy came out. Tammy Ma, who leads [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=199.72000000000003s)]
*  the lab's laser fusion research initiatives, got the call while waiting for a plane. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=207.76s)]
*  And I burst into tears. It was just tears of joy. And I actually physically started shaking and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=213.44s)]
*  jumping up and down, you know, at the gate before everybody board. So everybody was like, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=220.28s)]
*  what is that crazy woman doing? Tammy Ma is crazy about engineering. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=226.16s)]
*  And that's another one of our sensors. She showed us why the problem of fusion [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  would bring anyone to tears. First, there's the energy required, which is delivered by [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=235.8s)]
*  lasers in these tubes that are longer than a football field. And how many are there all [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=242.44s)]
*  together? 192 total lasers. Each one of these lasers is one of the most energetic in the world, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  and you have 192 of them. That's pretty cool, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=257.56s)]
*  Well, pretty hot, actually. Millions of degrees, which is why they use keys to lock up the lasers. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=261.0s)]
*  The beams strike with a power 1,000 times greater than the entire national power grid. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=271.32s)]
*  Your lights don't go out at home when they take a shot because these capacitors store the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=284.12s)]
*  electricity. In the tubes, the laser beams amplify by racing back and forth, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=289.96s)]
*  and the flash is a fraction of a second. We have to get to these incredible conditions, hotter, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  denser than the center of the sun. And so we need all of that laser energy to get to these very high [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=302.76s)]
*  energy densities. All that wallop vaporizes a target nearly too small to see. Can I hold this thing? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=317.0s)]
*  Unbelievable. Absolutely amazing. Michael Staterman's team builds the hollow target shells [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=323.48s)]
*  that are loaded with hydrogen at 430 degrees below zero. The precision that we need for making these [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  shells is extreme. The shells are almost perfectly round. They have a roughness that is 100 times [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=341.48s)]
*  better than a mirror. If it wasn't smoother than a mirror, imperfections would make the implosion [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=347.8s)]
*  of atoms uneven, causing a fusion fizzle. So these need to be as close to perfect as humanly possible. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=354.20000000000005s)]
*  This way. This way. And we do think they are among the most perfect items that we have on Earth. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=363.48s)]
*  Staterman's lab pursues perfection by vaporizing carbon and forming the shell out of diamond. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  They build 1,500 a year to make 150 nearly perfect. All the components are brought together [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  under the microscope itself, and then the assembler uses electromechanical stages to put the parts [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=384.68s)]
*  where they're supposed to go, move them together, and then we apply glue using a hair. A hair? Yeah, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  usually something like an eyelash or a similar or a cat whisker. You apply glue with a cat whisker? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=397.32s)]
*  This way. Why does it have to be so small? The laser gives us only a finite amount of energy, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=403.0s)]
*  and to drive a bigger capsule we would need more energy. So it's a constraint of the facility that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=411.88s)]
*  you've seen that is very large, and despite its big size, this is about what we can drive with it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=417.08s)]
*  The target could be larger, but then the laser would have to be larger. That is correct. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=422.03999999999996s)]
*  On December 5th, they used a thicker target so it would hold its shape longer, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=427.71999999999997s)]
*  and they figured out how to boost the power of the laser shot without damaging the lasers. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=436.12s)]
*  So this is an example of a target before the shot. Tammy Ma showed us an intact target assembly. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=442.6s)]
*  That diamond shell you saw is inside that silver-colored cylinder. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=450.76s)]
*  This assembly goes into a blue vacuum chamber three stories tall. It's hard to see here because [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=457.96s)]
*  it's bristling with lasers and instruments. This instrument they call Dante because they told us [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=464.92s)]
*  it measures the fires of hell. One physicist said, you should see the target we blasted December 5th. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=472.2s)]
*  Which made us ask, could we? Have you seen this before? This is the first time I'm seeing it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=480.68s)]
*  For Tammy Ma and for the world, this is the first look at what's left of the target assembly [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=487.88s)]
*  that changed history. An artifact like Bell's first phone or Edison's light bulb. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=495.48s)]
*  This thing is going to end up in the Smithsonian. The target cylinder was blasted to oblivion. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=502.76s)]
*  The copper support that held it was peeled backward. The explosion on the end of this [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=510.12s)]
*  was hotter than the sun. It was hotter than the center of the sun. We were able to achieve [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=516.76s)]
*  temperatures that were the hottest in the entire solar system. Which would make an astronomical [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=522.76s)]
*  change in electric power. Unlike today's nuclear plants, which split atoms apart, fusing them is [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=529.08s)]
*  many times more powerful with little long-term radiation and it's easy to turn off so no meltdowns. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=537.32s)]
*  But getting from the first ignition to a power plant will be hard. How many shots do you take in [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=545.72s)]
*  a day? We take on average a little more than one shot per day. If this was theoretically a commercial [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=553.24s)]
*  power plant, how many shots a day would be required? Approximately 10 shots per second [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=561.08s)]
*  would be required and the other big challenge of course is not just increasing the repetition rate [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=568.12s)]
*  but also getting the gain out of the targets to go up to about a factor of 100. Not only would [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=573.5600000000001s)]
*  the reactions have to produce 100 times more energy but a power plant would need 900,000 perfect [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=580.84s)]
*  diamond shells a day. Also the lasers would have to be much more efficient. Remember December's [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=589.48s)]
*  breakthrough put two units of energy in and got three out? Well it took 300 units of power to fire [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=597.88s)]
*  the lasers. By that standard it was 300 in three out. That detail was not front and center. At the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=606.76s)]
*  Department of Energy's December news conference which fused the advance with an unlikely timeline. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=616.44s)]
*  Today's announcement is a huge step forward to the president's goal of achieving commercial fusion [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=623.8800000000001s)]
*  within a decade. When you heard that President Biden's goal was commercial fusion power in a [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=632.6800000000001s)]
*  decade, you thought what? I thought it was nonsense. Charles Seif is a trained mathematician, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=640.44s)]
*  science author and professor at New York University who wrote a 2008 book on the hyping of fusion [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=647.0s)]
*  power. I don't want to diminish the fact that this is a real achievement. Ignition is a milestone [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=654.36s)]
*  that people have been trying for to do for years. I'm afraid that there are so many technical hurdles [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=660.2800000000001s)]
*  even after this great achievement that 10 years is a pipe dream. Those hurdles, Seif says, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=666.44s)]
*  include scaling up Livermore's achievement. The December shot generated about enough [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=673.72s)]
*  excess power to boil two pots of coffee. The hurdles might be overcome, Seif says, but [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=680.2s)]
*  not soon. I have a running bet going that we're not going to have it by 2050. Still, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=687.6400000000001s)]
*  betting against Charles Seif's prophecy are more than 30 private companies designing various [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=694.2s)]
*  approaches to fusion power, including using magnets, not lasers. $3 billion in private [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=700.68s)]
*  money flowed into those companies in the last 13 months, including bets by Bill Gates and Google. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=708.44s)]
*  Amid all this speculation, Lawrence Livermore's director, Kim Budell, is certain of one thing. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=716.68s)]
*  Can you do it again? Absolutely. They're going to try again next month. Budell agrees the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=724.44s)]
*  obstacles are enormous, but she told us commercial fusion power could be demonstrated in 20 years or [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=731.48s)]
*  so with enough funding and dedication. We likened the first ignition to the first Wright Brothers [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=739.0s)]
*  flight, which covered only 120 feet. It's one thing to believe that the science is possible, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=746.6s)]
*  that the conditions can be created. It's another to see it in action. And it really is a remarkable [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=756.36s)]
*  feeling after working for 60 years to get to this point to have first taken that first flight. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=762.52s)]
*  It was 44 years from a puddle jump to supersonic flight. Whether fusion power is 10 or 50 years [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=770.4399999999999s)]
*  away is now mainly an engineering problem. Lawrence Livermore has proven that from a machine, a star [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=779.9599999999999s)]
*  is born. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=790.04s)]
*  The transition from fossil fuels to sustainable electric power has gone mainstream, most visibly [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=799.56s)]
*  in the auto industry. The major car companies are chasing Tesla with ambitious plans for fleets of [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=806.36s)]

*  Here on a frigid plain near the Arctic Circle, worries about an overheating planet seem far [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1653.56s)]
*  away. Yet tiny Iceland has put itself on the front line with a new kind of machine that will [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1659.56s)]
*  fight climate change by sucking carbon dioxide out of the air. This is Orca, the first commercial [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1668.6s)]
*  direct air capture plant on earth. What are these fans? How does this work? Here you see the backside [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1676.52s)]
*  of these collectors where the air is being pulled through the system by aid of these fans. Carlos [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1683.8799999999999s)]
*  Härtel is chief technology officer for Climeworks, the Swiss company that built Orca. He told us as [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1690.2s)]
*  the fans draw air in the carbon dioxide is trapped by a special filter inside these giant collectors [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1697.72s)]
*  each the size of a shipping container. The captured CO2 is then siphoned off to storage tanks. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1705.56s)]
*  We had to shout over the powerful fans as a bitter wind whipped around us. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1713.8s)]
*  So you didn't come for this wonderful weather? No we did not. We knew that the winters were harsh [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1720.6s)]
*  but it's a good real life test as well for the plant. What you're describing almost sounds like [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1725.0s)]
*  science fiction but what you're saying is that we can actually do this. People never doubted the [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1730.12s)]
*  fundamental physics or chemistry of it but realizing it under real life conditions is a [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1736.52s)]
*  whole different matter and that's what this system shows. It can be done. Climeworks is now [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1741.48s)]
*  building a new plant in Iceland 10 times the size of Orca that will look like this. A modular design [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1747.24s)]
*  that Härtel told us can be easily assembled but capturing the CO2 is only half of the story. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1754.44s)]
*  So this is where the magic happens. The second half starts here in these metal igloos where the [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1762.04s)]
*  CO2 is sent to be buried in the poorest volcanic rock of Iceland. So this pipe is actually filled [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1768.52s)]
*  with water. Sandra Osk is a geologist with Carbfix, an Icelandic company that pioneered [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1774.84s)]
*  the groundbreaking injection method. Here we have the CO2 and the CO2 is actually dissolved in water [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1781.32s)]
*  so it's actually just fizzy water. Just fizzy water? Yeah and this fizzy water is being injected [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1788.68s)]
*  here into the injection well. How far down does it go? It actually reaches over a mile. A mile down? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1795.08s)]
*  Yeah. The fizzy water is shot like a soda stream into Iceland's basaltic rock where it reacts with [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1802.28s)]
*  the minerals and hardens to stone in less than two years. So the fizzy water turns into this [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1809.24s)]
*  in just a matter of years? So you take this gas that you can't see, you turn it into fizzy water [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1817.96s)]
*  and then it turns to stone and you don't have to worry about it. Turned into stone. It's quite [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1824.68s)]
*  amazing. Carbfix didn't invent the process, nature did, but nature takes millennia. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1830.3600000000001s)]
*  After years of experimenting in Iceland's grueling outdoor laboratory, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1838.8400000000001s)]
*  Carbfix figured out how to speed things up. Aerospace engineer Carlos Härtel told us Orca [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1843.3200000000002s)]
*  was a milestone. Now the hard part starts, scaling up fast enough to slow climate change. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1850.76s)]
*  Whether we are taking the right direction will depend as much on societal things than on technical [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1858.36s)]
*  matters. Am I optimistic as an engineer? I am absolutely. Am I lost in this as a citizen? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1863.4s)]
*  Maybe half half. I haven't made up my mind yet. This goal can be reached technically. It's just [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1868.6s)]
*  whether we have the political and social will to do it. I think that's the exact right way of [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1875.96s)]
*  looking at it. There's been a stampede of investment. Microsoft, Airbus, insurance giants, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1881.56s)]
*  Swiss Re have poured in millions of dollars, but it's a stupefying challenge. Orca is built to take [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1888.76s)]
*  out the emissions of about 800 cars or 4,000 tons of CO2 a year. A tiny fraction of the annual [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1896.6000000000001s)]
*  10 billion tons, scientists say, we need to remove from the atmosphere. It's the problem of [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1905.32s)]
*  our generation. It's like a moonshot. It's going. Calorie Hegelsen is an astrophysicist with Carbfix. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1911.48s)]
*  He told us studying space helped him to think big. We met him on a barren stretch of rock that could [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1918.2s)]
*  have been Mars, but Hegelsen told us he saw potential. We need big solutions. We need to [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1925.3999999999999s)]
*  return the carbon back to where it came from, which is the earth. Tell me what you're doing here. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1932.36s)]
*  This will be a first of a kind carbon mineral storage terminal, which means that we are going [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1938.52s)]
*  to bring in CO2, transport it from industrial point sources in Europe and ship it here and [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1943.8799999999999s)]
*  inject it for full mineral storage. It will be the world's first industrial scale underground [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1951.32s)]
*  disposal site for CO2, capable of handling 3 million tons a year. Hegelsen sketched out a [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1959.32s)]
*  new world where tankers running on green methanol would transport carbon dioxide from European [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1967.72s)]
*  businesses to Iceland. Is this going to happen fast enough to help us with climate change? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1974.52s)]
*  I don't know. To be perfectly honest, we are demonstrating the first mineral storage hub here [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1982.36s)]
*  at the megaton scale. Whether that will happen in time, that is not entirely up to us. That is up to [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1989.24s)]
*  politicians, governance, financers, societies, and quite frankly, we are running out of time. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=1995.64s)]
*  Direct air capture as it now exists is expensive and energy intensive. In Iceland, that energy is [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2002.52s)]
*  geothermal, renewable and green. That's not the case elsewhere. So governments in Europe and the [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2009.8000000000002s)]
*  U.S. have dangled billions of dollars of tax breaks to encourage companies to take the plunge. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2017.24s)]
*  But there is a bigger question than just who writes the check. Do you fear that people will think, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2023.64s)]
*  oh, well, we can now clean the air. We can just take the CO2 out of the air so [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2031.88s)]
*  we can carry on with business as usual? All the time. Yeah. But that's not how it works. We must [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2039.48s)]
*  stop the emissions and wean ourselves off of fossil fuels. That's what we need to do right now. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2045.72s)]
*  On top of that, we also must take down the carbon that we've already put up in the atmosphere. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2052.12s)]
*  Only then will we reach our climate goals. So carbon capture can never be [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2058.36s)]
*  an excuse for continuing business as usual. But it's that business as usual that critics [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2066.84s)]
*  are warning against as direct air capture expands to the U.S. That's because here, oil companies are [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2072.92s)]
*  one of the technology's biggest boosters. They have been capturing CO2 to inject into oil wells [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2080.04s)]
*  for decades, not to bury it, but to flush out more oil. For Calri Hegelsen of CarbFix and many others, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2086.28s)]
*  that's a non-starter. We don't see the need to work with the oil and gas sector. If the oil and gas [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2094.52s)]
*  industry could help with the financing of the direct air capture, why not team up with them? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2101.08s)]
*  We don't need them for direct air capture and quite frankly, we don't want there to be an oil [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2110.76s)]
*  and gas industry in 40, 50 years. There will still be an oil industry in 50 years. I have no doubt [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2119.96s)]
*  about that. I think our company, though, will be a different company by 2050. That company is [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2127.8s)]
*  Occidental Petroleum and Vicki Hollub is CEO. She wants to turn Oxy into what she calls a carbon [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2133.8s)]
*  management company. It has set aside more than a billion dollars to build what will be the world's [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2141.1600000000003s)]
*  largest direct air capture plant in Texas. So this would represent the CO2 that's equivalent [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2147.0800000000004s)]
*  to taking 200,000 cars off the road. Hollub showed us the Texas version of how CO2 would be [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2153.4s)]
*  sucked out of the air. These are air contact towers. Some of the captured CO2 will be locked [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2160.2000000000003s)]
*  away underground, just as we saw in Iceland. Some will still be used to extract more oil. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2166.84s)]
*  But Hollub told us using carbon sucked out of the air means the new oil produced is what she calls [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2173.4s)]
*  carbon neutral. That was hard to wrap our heads around. But you'll be using carbon that you're [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2180.68s)]
*  capturing and taking out of the air to produce more oil that will then generate more carbon. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2187.3199999999997s)]
*  But the oil will emit less carbon than the CO2 we've injected to get it. So we've put more, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2195.3199999999997s)]
*  at least the equivalent, and sometimes more CO2 in the ground to get that oil [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2203.72s)]
*  than the oil will emit when used. Hollub told us producing oil this way is essential in the [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2211.0s)]
*  transition to a green economy. Airlines and ships, for example, would need to run on fossil fuels [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2217.72s)]
*  until a sustainable alternative is found. That could take years. Until then, Hollub argues, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2224.3599999999997s)]
*  using CO2 to get that oil helps keep a lid on emissions. Your critics will say you can't trust [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2231.32s)]
*  an oil company talking about reducing CO2, that your mission here is tantamount to greenwashing. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2238.92s)]
*  I would first say that we would never spend $1.2 billion for greenwashing. So we've got a [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2247.8s)]
*  monumental task ahead of us. The way that the CO2 enhanced oil recovery process works [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2253.72s)]
*  is that we can reduce more out of the atmosphere than what our products will emit when used. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2261.4s)]
*  And so if that's not a concept that people can get, then we will not have a chance to achieve [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2269.3199999999997s)]
*  what we need to achieve. Hollub told us she knows critics of big oil are suspicious, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2278.2s)]
*  and that many feel industry isn't moving fast enough to avoid a climate catastrophe. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2285.72s)]
*  On that point, Hollub doesn't disagree. She told us, with the help of tax incentives, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2291.08s)]
*  Occidental plans to build 130 more direct air capture plants by 2035. We know how to make it [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2297.48s)]
*  happen. We know how to drill the wells. We know how to safely sequester it. We were in Iceland and [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2305.4s)]
*  we were talking to some of the direct air capture companies, and to be blunt, they don't quite believe [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2311.0s)]
*  you. We're going to walk the talk. That's the only way that does it. Words will never [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2318.6s)]
*  convince anybody. We need to get the direct air capture up and working. We need to make it better, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2323.48s)]
*  make it more economical, and start having it developed all around the world. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2330.04s)]
*  The next decade will be critical if the direct air capture industry is to grow big enough to [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2336.68s)]
*  make an impact. Both CarbFix and Climeworks told us they will be expanding to the U.S. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2341.88s)]
*  Neither plans to work with the American oil industry. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZejZxjvFng&t=2349.16s)]
