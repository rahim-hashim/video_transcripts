*  The Nuclear Disaster [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Some tragedies never end. Ask people to name a nuclear disaster, and most will probably [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=13.0s)]
*  point to Fukushima in Japan three years ago. The nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl in Ukraine [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=18.84s)]
*  was 30 years ago, but the crisis is still with us today. That's because radiation [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=24.74s)]
*  virtually never dies. After the explosion in 1986, the Soviets built a primitive sarcophagus, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=30.259999999999998s)]
*  a tomb, to cover the stricken reactor, but it wasn't meant to last very long and it [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=37.94s)]
*  hasn't. Engineers say there's still enough radioactive material in there to cause widespread [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=43.26s)]
*  contamination. For the last five years, a massive project has been underway to steal [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=49.099999999999994s)]
*  the reactor permanently, but the undertaking is three quarters of a billion dollars short [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=54.58s)]
*  and the completion date has been delayed repeatedly. Thirty years later, Chernobyl's crippled [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=60.06s)]
*  reactor still has the power to kill. It's called the zone and getting into it is crossing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=65.94s)]
*  a border into one of the most contaminated places on earth. The 20-mile no man's land [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=74.02s)]
*  was evacuated nearly 30 years ago. Drive to the center of the zone today and you'll see [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=81.74s)]
*  a massive structure that appears to rise out of nowhere. It's an engineering effort the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=87.94s)]
*  likes of which the world has never seen. With funds from over 40 different countries, 1,400 [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=94.5s)]
*  workers are building a giant arch to cover the damaged reactor like a casserole. It will [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=102.02s)]
*  be taller than the Statue of Liberty and wider than Yankee Stadium, the largest movable [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=107.9s)]
*  structure on earth. Nicholas Kai is overseeing the arch's construction. You know, when you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=113.74000000000001s)]
*  think about it, you had this massive project going on, all these people working here, billions [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  of dollars being spent because of one day 30 years ago. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=126.42s)]
*  It was the biggest disaster of the nuclear industry, yes. The disaster was sparked by [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  massive explosions that tore the roof off of Chernobyl's reactor number four, spewing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=140.33999999999997s)]
*  radioactive dust into the atmosphere. The Soviets drafted over half a million troops to put [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  out the fire and clear the nuclear debris. Thousands got seriously ill from radiation [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=155.01999999999998s)]
*  exposure. Today, three decades later, the cleanup continues. But as this recent video [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=161.54s)]
*  shows, the reactor is still packed with poison. Heaps of gnarled steel and concrete, pools [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=171.18s)]
*  of nuclear fuel that have hardened into a dense mass called the elephant's foot. There's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=178.78s)]
*  still so much radiation coming from the reactor that workers have to construct the arch nearly [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=186.06s)]
*  a thousand feet away, shielded by a massive concrete wall. When finished, the arch will [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=191.38s)]
*  be slid into place around the sarcophagus, then sealed up. We will push it in once. The [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=197.62s)]
*  average speed will be around 10 meter an hour. So it's approximately the speed of a snail. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  Right, but that's pretty rapid considering the size of this thing. It is, yes. But the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  construction itself will have to move a lot quicker. The old plant and sarcophagus are [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=221.26s)]
*  falling apart. Just two years ago, a snowstorm caused the roof of one of the buildings to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=228.01999999999998s)]
*  collapse, forcing workers to be evacuated and raising fears of further contamination. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=233.7s)]
*  Radiation is not subject to the usual rules of life and death. It is virtually eternal. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=243.89999999999998s)]
*  When Kai took us on a tour of the site, we were fitted with dosimeters to tell us how [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=249.72s)]
*  much we were being exposed to. Suddenly, a sound we didn't want to hear. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=254.16s)]
*  Hey, this beeper's going off. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=259.32s)]
*  No, no, it's not, it's normal. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=261.68s)]
*  You're sure? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=263.76s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, I'm definitely sure. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=264.76s)]
*  I don't like a beeper in Chernobyl. I don't like that sound. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=266.88s)]
*  Building the arch under these conditions is challenging enough, but some of the biggest [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=273.16s)]
*  obstacles have nothing to do with radiation. As violence gripped Ukraine this year, one [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=277.44s)]
*  of the arch's contractors backed out. The project is also $770 million short and has [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  been plagued by repeated delays. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=290.12s)]
*  No matter when it's completed, vast stretches of the zone will never recover. This is the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=293.52s)]
*  city of Pripyat, two miles from the reactor. Thirty years ago, the population was 50,000. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=299.32s)]
*  Today, it is zero. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=306.48s)]
*  Pripyat was where many of the plant's workers lived, grateful for their posting in a town [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=310.36s)]
*  that was the model of Soviet modernity. Nine-story apartment buildings lined this boulevard. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=315.64s)]
*  They're still there, but you can't see them anymore. The forest has taken over. A vision [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=321.84s)]
*  perhaps of what the whole world might look like were people to just disappear. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  It was springtime in Pripyat that day in 1986, and an amusement park was due to open in a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=335.44s)]
*  few days. Andrei Glukhov lived here then. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=341.6s)]
*  So that ferris wheel never had any kids in it? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=346.24s)]
*  Never had any kids. These bumper cars on your left had never kids in it, too. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=349.16s)]
*  When you talk to your former neighbors, what do you call it? The accident, the catastrophe? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  We just call it 26, which was the date of the accident. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=362.88s)]
*  26? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=367.92s)]
*  26 of April. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=368.92s)]
*  Sort of like the Americans call 9-11. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=369.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=372.44s)]
*  Back then, Glukhov worked for Chernobyl's Nuclear Safety Division. He took us on a tour through [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=373.44s)]
*  a part of the plant that had not been destroyed. He was off duty that night, but what he saw [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=380.84s)]
*  when he drove past the damaged reactor was like nothing he or anyone else had ever seen. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=387.42s)]
*  This was a terrifying picture. It looked like a sunset in the distance about 100, 200 yards [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=395.42s)]
*  from you. And this was the glowing core of the reactor. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=407.54s)]
*  That was the first and the only time you saw it? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=414.70000000000005s)]
*  No, that was the first time when I realized the scale of the disaster. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=419.54s)]
*  Glukhov told his family in Pripyat to stay inside and close the windows. Soviet authorities [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=432.66s)]
*  covered the area with secrecy, told people they had nothing to worry about. But 36 hours [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=439.14s)]
*  later, over a thousand buses were sent in to evacuate everyone. Authorities told people [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=445.34s)]
*  it would only be for three days, one of many lies. The people never came back, and Pripyat [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  is being overwhelmed by the elements. One of the only things still recognizable is that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=460.3s)]
*  old Soviet iconography. Drive through the zone and you'll find that many villages suffer [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=465.94s)]
*  the same fate as Pripyat. A row of simple markers has been planted with the names of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=476.3s)]
*  each one. But amidst this wilderness, the strangest sight of all, people. Just a few. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=481.98s)]
*  Ivan Ivanovich and his wife Maria were evacuated to an apartment block near Kiev after the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=489.98s)]
*  accident but couldn't take it. They weren't made for the city, so two years later they [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=497.3s)]
*  came back. Today, there are three other people living in this village, just a few miles from [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=502.82s)]
*  the old power plant. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=508.98s)]
*  When you decided to come back to live here, did anyone tell you it was dangerous? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=510.94s)]
*  It's really okay here. You know, when I lived in that apartment block, I got sick all the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=518.98s)]
*  time. But when I came back here, I was fine, and I've been fine ever since. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=526.3000000000001s)]
*  You should never leave home. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=533.66s)]
*  I would be long gone if I'd stayed there. I'd be in the ground. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=536.26s)]
*  Despite the danger, Tim Musel also chose to be here. For the last 15 years, the university [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=541.34s)]
*  of South Carolina biologists has been studying the contamination's impact from a makeshift [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=548.98s)]
*  lab inside the zone. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=555.1s)]
*  Aren't many serious labs I've seen that look like this. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=557.74s)]
*  Yeah, this is an opportunistic lab. It's an old villager's house. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=561.7s)]
*  Musel's research has shown that the catastrophe continues to take its toll. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=566.78s)]
*  And we're going to attempt to measure just how radioactive these mice are. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=572.58s)]
*  That's a comparison between the amounts of radiation a mouse would have here and a mouse [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=577.58s)]
*  somewhere else. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=582.94s)]
*  Some of these mice have on the order of 10,000 times more radioactivity in their bodies than [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=584.1800000000001s)]
*  in clean areas. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=592.58s)]
*  The human toll has been profound as well. Thyroid cancer and leukemia affected thousands, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=594.82s)]
*  though the exact number of deaths is still being debated. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=602.5400000000001s)]
*  There certainly is evidence that some of the genetic damage that occurs at the level [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=606.42s)]
*  of the DNA can be transmitted from one generation to the next. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=610.4399999999999s)]
*  So a nuclear disaster is never over. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=614.14s)]
*  There will be areas that will be contaminated for thousands, if not millions of years. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=616.5s)]
*  This makes the zone like no other place on earth, which is why it's attracting tourists. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=625.18s)]
*  If you've done Paris and Rome, why not try a holiday in hell? Check out the apocalypse. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=631.84s)]
*  How did your friends react when you told them you were coming on vacation to Chernobyl? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=639.12s)]
*  They thought it was very strange. People have been coming here for a while, so I guess it [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=643.44s)]
*  must be safe. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=648.88s)]
*  You guess it must be safe. What makes you believe it's safe? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=650.64s)]
*  Well, you know, we'd assume that the guides wouldn't bring people here if it wasn't safe. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=654.24s)]
*  Well, I hope you're right. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=659.2s)]
*  So do I. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=660.88s)]
*  Thousands of workers fled into the zone every day to look after what remains of the plant. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=665.12s)]
*  Others live here year-round in one of the few places safe enough for inhabitants, the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=670.84s)]
*  town of Chernobyl itself. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=675.68s)]
*  Yevgen Gonserenko was our guide. He lives here too. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=677.96s)]

*  When the shaking stopped, a tsunami raced toward shore with as much fury as nature can [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=862.8599999999999s)]

*  Norio Kimura lived with his wife and two daughters next door to his parents. The tsunami killed [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=983.34s)]

*  This is a shoe she was wearing that day, which was found in a heap of rubble six months after [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1013.16s)]
*  the disaster. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1017.64s)]
*  Because of radiation, Kimura can only visit his former home ten times a year and stay [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1021.28s)]
*  only five hours. In February, his Olata day came in the middle of a blizzard. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1026.76s)]
*  On each visit, Kimura brings flowers to a small shrine he built to honor his family. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1035.3799999999999s)]
*  There were among the 111 people who died in Okuma that day. The remains of 110 have [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1041.24s)]
*  been recovered. The only one still missing is Norio Kimura's daughter, Yuna. Ten times [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1047.26s)]
*  a year, he goes back home to search for her. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1055.46s)]
*  On Saturday you were digging again in Okuma. It was snowing, it was freezing. Why? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1061.02s)]
*  To find Yuna, of course. And also, if I stop searching or gathering her things, I will [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1068.56s)]
*  lose the connection with her. To be honest, the reason why I can live my life every day [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1077.44s)]
*  is because I have to find her and her things. I need to do this to keep my sanity. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1084.72s)]
*  Volunteers now help Kimura dig through the piles of debris left by the tsunami. Everyone [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1091.72s)]
*  is dressed in protective clothing to limit their exposure to radiation. The digging seems [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1101.78s)]
*  futile but on this day, Kimura unearthed clothing he says belonged to his surviving daughter, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1107.18s)]
*  Mayu. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1113.66s)]
*  On March 11th, the day of the tsunami, Kimura made a mistake for which he will never forgive [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1115.46s)]
*  himself. He was at work on a farm and he stayed there. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1121.1s)]
*  Did you think then that there would be a tsunami? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1126.0s)]
*  There was a radio at my work and my boss told me that the tsunami was going to be three [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1132.24s)]
*  meters tall. My house is five to six meters above sea level, so I was convinced that our [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1136.5s)]
*  home would be fine and didn't worry about it after that at all. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1143.82s)]
*  Do you think there's anything you could have done to save your family? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1150.82s)]
*  I should have gone home right away. I regret believing the information easily while my [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1158.02s)]
*  family was in life-threatening danger. Even now, I say to myself, what was I doing wrong [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1166.3s)]
*  in my thinking? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1173.5s)]
*  When radiation forced the evacuation of Okuma, the town leader told Norio Kimura to stop [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1177.18s)]
*  searching for the missing and start caring for the living. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1183.18s)]
*  So, he and his daughter moved here to the Japanese Alps where the brisk air and the [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1187.1s)]
*  snow-capped mountains made radiation and tsunamis difficult to imagine. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1192.7s)]
*  Kimura has traded farming for a guest house he's planning to open. His daughter, Mayu, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1200.5s)]
*  talks about her mother more than her missing sister and doesn't ask why her father continues [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1206.46s)]
*  searching for her. Their new mountain home is 2,000 feet above the perils of the sea [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1211.96s)]
*  and 180 miles from the Fukushima plant. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1218.3400000000001s)]
*  Ghost towns surround the plant now, but three years later, there are still more than 4,000 [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1223.8600000000001s)]
*  workers there, all of them wearing layers of protection. Because of the exposure to [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1229.62s)]
*  radiation, the men in this building are only allowed to work two and a half hours a day. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1235.1s)]
*  They're not producing any electricity. They're just cleaning up. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1241.06s)]
*  Were TEPCO workers adequately trained to handle the emergency? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1245.9799999999998s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1250.82s)]
*  Within months of the accident, Yowichi Funabashi, a former newspaper editor, headed an investigation [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1252.26s)]
*  into what went wrong and why. It was the only investigation not sponsored by the government [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1258.74s)]
*  and its conclusions were brutal. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1264.54s)]
*  I was very much concerned about the government not telling the truth to the public. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1267.1s)]
*  The revelations in Funabashi's report added to the public's anger and dismay. He wrote [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1275.6599999999999s)]
*  that from the beginning, the government had conspired with the industry to convince people [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1281.4199999999998s)]
*  that nuclear power is safe. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1286.8799999999999s)]
*  So the government effort at the time was to convince people that there was nothing to [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1289.04s)]
*  worry about? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1294.16s)]
*  Exactly. Nothing to worry about. Don't worry. Even don't prepare for that severe accident [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1295.52s)]
*  because that would cause unnecessary unease and unnecessary misunderstanding. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1305.04s)]
*  And there's no reason to prepare? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1311.56s)]
*  No reason to prepare. So this avoidance ultimately translated into unpreparedness. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1313.76s)]
*  Mother Nature threw a real curveball to the Japanese with that huge tsunami. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1319.76s)]
*  Last year, TEPCO hired American nuclear engineer Lake Barrett as an advisor. Barrett directed [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1323.92s)]
*  the cleanup at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant after its accident in 1979. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1330.6s)]
*  It's estimated that the cleanup is going to take 30 to 40 years. To a layman that sounds [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1337.7199999999998s)]
*  very, very long. Explain why that's the case. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1344.12s)]
*  To me that's not long at all. That's what I would expect for that kind of thing. It's [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1346.7199999999998s)]
*  a huge challenge. It's a big on-site mess that they have to clean up and it's going [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1350.3999999999999s)]
*  to take them decades to do it. It took us 10 years to do Three Mile Island and Three [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1354.6799999999998s)]
*  Mile Island accident was much simpler than they have at Fukushima. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1358.4399999999998s)]
*  Are they where you thought they would be three years later? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1362.84s)]
*  I'd hope they'd be further along. It's been challenging technically, it's been challenging [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1367.56s)]
*  culturally and politically for them. But they're making good progress now. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1372.8s)]
*  Sounds like you're being a little diplomatic. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1377.24s)]
*  Well, decision making process in Japan is complicated. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1378.64s)]
*  Decision making in Japan requires consensus and reaching consensus often takes a very [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1383.2s)]
*  long time. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1388.88s)]
*  The most difficult job will be to dismantle the melted reactors but radiation is too high [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1390.88s)]
*  for workers to get there. For now, TEPCO is inundated with groundwater that leaks into [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1396.48s)]
*  the reactors and gets contaminated. Every day, a hundred thousand gallons of radioactive [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1403.76s)]
*  water has to be pumped out before it reaches the ocean. TEPCO is filling storage tanks [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1410.16s)]

*  bags holding the radioactive waste, filling the empty spaces in towns like Okuma. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1439.0800000000002s)]
*  Now, some of the kids from Okuma live and go to school 70 miles away. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1446.08s)]
*  How many of you would like to go back to Okuma? Everybody. How many of you think you will [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1452.08s)]
*  go back to Okuma? What's keeping you from going back to Okuma now? You can tell me. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1463.08s)]
*  Because there's a lot of radiation. There's a lot of radioactive material there. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1472.08s)]
*  These kids will be middle-aged before the cleanup is finished. Their homes could have [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1478.08s)]
*  been rebuilt quickly if it had just been an earthquake and a tsunami. It's the man-made [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1483.08s)]
*  disaster which will take decades to repair. This is the class that Norio Kimura's daughter [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1488.08s)]
*  Yu Na would have been in if she were alive. Her friend Kureya remembers they ate lunch [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1494.08s)]
*  together. Where is she now? In Okuma. She's lonely being alone in the town of Okuma all [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1500.08s)]
*  this time. I think she must be lonely. About a third of the residents from Okuma decided [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1510.08s)]
*  to stick together and moved into what the government called temporary housing. Temporary [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1517.08s)]
*  is lasting a long time. The three generations of Kimura's that once lived together are [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1523.08s)]
*  now split apart. Norio and his daughter live in Nagano, five hours away from his mother [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1530.08s)]
*  to Moe. She lives in the temporary housing, alone in a cold and cramped room furnished [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1536.08s)]
*  with photographs. The Kimura's, like many Japanese, have a strong connection to their [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1543.08s)]
*  dead and feel obliged to help them be at peace. As long as the dead are in limbo, so are the [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1549.08s)]
*  living. You've lost so much of your family. Why aren't you together with your son now? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1556.08s)]
*  I'm with my husband's ashes now. Once I find a proper place to put him, I'd like to go [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1562.08s)]
*  to Nagano. What do you think the right place will be? Our family cemetery in Okuma is contaminated [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1574.08s)]
*  with radiation now. I could come back two or three times a year to burn incense for [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1584.08s)]
*  him, but my grandchild would not be able to come. I don't want to keep him or his grandchild, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1590.08s)]
*  whom he used to adore so much, can't even come to visit. Ten times a year, Norio Kimura [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1597.08s)]
*  visits his ancestors in the family cemetery, a place where he thought he would be laid to rest [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1608.08s)]
*  one day and where his children would come to visit him. But he won't find any peace, he says, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1614.08s)]
*  until after he finds Yuna. Do you think there's any chance you'll ever find your daughter? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1620.08s)]
*  I know that the chance is very slim, but no matter how slim the chance is, I still cannot stop. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1629.08s)]
*  From the outside looking in, I know that this is very unlikely, but I still can't stop, even [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1639.08s)]
*  if I cannot ever find her. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1648.08s)]
*  Every year, coal-burning power plants generate not only electricity, but a staggering amount [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1663.08s)]
*  of leftover coal ash that contains heavy metals unhealthy to humans. Yet due in part to intense [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1668.08s)]
*  industry lobbying, there are no federal regulations on its disposal. It's left to the states to [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1675.08s)]
*  oversee some of the most powerful utility companies in the country. So coal ash is often just [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1682.08s)]
*  dumped into giant pits that are dug by rivers and lakes where toxins can leach into nearby water [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1688.08s)]
*  and soil. There are over 1,000 ash pits or ponds dotting the nation, many of them old, poorly [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1695.08s)]
*  monitored, all but forgotten. But every few years we are reminded that the status quo can lead to [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1703.08s)]
*  disaster, like the coal ash spill this past February into North Carolina's Dan River at a power plant [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1710.08s)]
*  owned by Duke Energy, the biggest utility company in the country. The spill at Dan River happened [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1717.08s)]
*  when a drainage pipe that ran underneath an ash basin and dam collapsed, sucking out six decades [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1725.08s)]
*  of waste and spewing gunk directly into the river. It was an accident. It didn't work the way it [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1732.08s)]
*  should have worked. It did not meet our standards or expectations. Duke Energy CEO Lynn Good, then [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1739.08s)]
*  only seven months on the job, had a crisis on her hands. How many tons of ash do you know went into [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1746.08s)]
*  the river? Yes, we released between 30 and 39,000 tons of ash into the river. Wow. We moved immediately [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1754.08s)]
*  to repair the pipe and also begin cleaning the river. And we've used this as an opportunity at Duke [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1763.08s)]
*  to raise our standards even higher of all of our bases to ensure and confirm that they were operating [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1770.08s)]
*  safely. Once the water spilled out of the basin, this is what was exposed. Canyons and ridges of [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1776.08s)]
*  industrial waste the size of 20 football fields buried right by the river where people fish and swim [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1783.08s)]
*  and get their drinking water. But the accident at Dan River wasn't the first time a coal ash pond [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1790.08s)]
*  collapsed. It happened to another company six years ago in Kingston, Tennessee. That spill was more [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1797.08s)]
*  than 100 times larger, smothering homes in toxic muck and choking up the river. After Kingston, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1804.08s)]
*  in 2008. Did Duke raise its vigilance? Yes, there were inspections that went on throughout the [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1812.08s)]
*  industry and certainly at Duke where all of the basins were reviewed. Actually, inspections had been [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1821.08s)]
*  going on for years, including this one in 1986 that Duke itself paid for. It recommended quantitative [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1826.08s)]
*  monitoring of the very pipe that collapsed, saying it was expected to have less longevity. So that [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1833.08s)]
*  first report urging Duke to watch that pipe was 30 years ago, but there were others, 1996, 2001, 2006, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1841.08s)]
*  advising you to keep watching that pipe over and over. 2009, the EPA warned about the pipe. How could [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1851.08s)]
*  you neglect those? The results of those inspections indicated that we should monitor and we were [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1860.08s)]
*  monitoring. And what we were looking for is that the pipe would leak before it failed, but it didn't [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1865.08s)]
*  fail in that way. It failed without leaking. I don't think Duke even knew what was underneath some of [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1871.08s)]
*  their dams and knew the structural issues. The spill infuriated Pat McCrory, the pro-business Republican [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1877.08s)]
*  governor of North Carolina. He knows Duke well, having worked there for 29 years. How would you [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1885.08s)]
*  describe or rate Duke's record on dealing with coal ash disposal? Well, actually, there has been no [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1892.08s)]
*  record regarding coal ash disposal. They haven't done anything? Very little. Very little. I think the [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1899.08s)]
*  record's been quite poor because, frankly, it's been out of sight, out of mind. Leslie, we have been [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1905.08s)]
*  generating electricity in this country from coal for decades. And that means coal ash. And that ash that [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1911.08s)]
*  has been produced has been stored in accordance with industry standards and practices for decades. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1917.08s)]
*  We're at a period when the electric system, and certainly Duke's system, is modernizing. We're adding natural [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1923.08s)]
*  gas. We're adding renewables. And we're closing some coal plants. Fact is, Duke closed the Dan River [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1928.08s)]
*  plant in 2012, and that perplexed the governor. When I heard about the Dan River plant having a coal ash [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1935.08s)]
*  spill, my first reaction was, wait a minute. That plant's been closed for years. Why are we having a spill [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1943.08s)]
*  at a plant that's not even open? That's because when they closed the plant, Duke just left the ash pond [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1950.08s)]
*  where it was. In an unprecedented program, Duke has closed half their coal ash plants in North Carolina [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1958.08s)]
*  in the last three years, blowing up one, after another, after another, as the company switches to natural [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1965.08s)]
*  gas. In all cases, they just left the coal ash ponds and basins behind. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1978.08s)]
*  This is no way to store industrial waste in large quantities in such a primitive way. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1985.08s)]
*  Frank Holloman, an attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, says it makes no sense to store coal ash [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1992.08s)]
*  that usually contains toxins like arsenic, mercury, thallium, and cadmium in basins right next to waterways. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=1999.08s)]
*  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out if you dig an earthen, unlined hole in the earth next to a river, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2007.08s)]
*  and you put in a substance that has toxic substances, that is going to leak into the groundwater. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2015.08s)]
*  It doesn't take a genius to figure that out. Your organization, you have been suing Duke Energy. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2021.08s)]
*  That's correct. Well, what we have hoped is that we could convince Duke, get the coal ash out of these [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2028.08s)]
*  unlined pits, move it to safe line, dry storage, away from the waterway. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2035.08s)]
*  That's what Duke is already doing with most of its newly generated ash, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2042.08s)]
*  trucking it to dry, lined landfills away from waterways, or sending it off for reuse as building material. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2047.08s)]
*  But the company's big problem is what to do with the 100 million tons of old coal ash it's accumulated [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2055.08s)]
*  in their 32 ponds in North Carolina, some like this one, up against people's backyards where children play. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2062.08s)]
*  Leslie, we're committed to closing all of the sites. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2070.08s)]
*  When you say close, what do you mean by close? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2073.08s)]
*  So there are various methods that can be used to close, certainly excavating them to a lined landfill is one of the methods. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2076.08s)]
*  That method would cost up to $8 billion. But Duke is considering two other options, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2084.08s)]
*  lining the bottom and top of the ponds but leaving the ash there, which would cost somewhat less, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2090.08s)]
*  or least pricey, at $2 billion, cap in place, which means just covering the top of the pond. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2097.08s)]
*  With no lining on the bottom? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2104.08s)]
*  And typically cap in place is not lined on the bottom, but we would not move forward with a cap in place [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2106.08s)]
*  unless we had a certainty that the water is safe. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2113.08s)]
*  And so that's where the science comes in, that's where the study needs to be completed, so that we develop smart solutions. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2116.08s)]
*  It's called cap in place. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2122.08s)]
*  Cap in place. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2124.08s)]
*  Right. Now, would that satisfy your organization? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2125.08s)]
*  No, it would not. An unlined pit next to a river, a lake, or a drinking water reservoir, it stays wet. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2128.08s)]
*  Only if you have a lining in it do you separate this industrial waste from the water table and the groundwater, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2134.08s)]
*  so cap in place is only pollute in place. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2141.08s)]
*  Well, obviously I'm not a scientist, but shouldn't you just say, okay, we're going to line them all? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2145.08s)]
*  I'd love to tell you there's a simple solution to this. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2150.08s)]
*  Why isn't that a simple solution? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2153.08s)]
*  That ash has been stored for decades, can be solved quickly. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2155.08s)]
*  We like quick answers. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2158.08s)]
*  We like to pull our cell phone up and do research and get answers right away. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2160.08s)]
*  But in order to do this right, we do need to do the study. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2164.08s)]
*  We need to understand what is the groundwater, where is the groundwater. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2167.08s)]
*  We need to understand the stability of the basin. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2171.08s)]
*  We need to understand the soil type. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2173.08s)]
*  I cannot immediately move 100 million tons of ash. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2175.08s)]
*  It's not a response that makes any sense, doesn't make common sense. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2181.08s)]
*  As much as I'd love to tell you, there's a simple solution. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2187.08s)]
*  It's one that requires study, and it's one that requires time to complete. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2190.08s)]
*  But environmentalists say studying is code for stalling because this problem isn't new. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2194.08s)]
*  Duke has been conducting tests around their ash ponds for decades. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2201.08s)]
*  And five years ago, when state regulators demanded to see the data, they found something alarming. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2207.08s)]
*  The coal ash ponds in all of Duke's 14 plants were either leaking toxic chemicals into rivers and streams [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2213.08s)]
*  or contaminating the groundwater. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2221.08s)]
*  Some of the readings that we have found are for elements like iron and manganese, which are naturally occurring. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2224.08s)]
*  But nine of your plants have been found to have groundwater violations for contaminants [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2232.08s)]
*  including lead, sulfate, boron, chromium, thallium, selenium, and arsenic. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2238.08s)]
*  So we have had exceedances. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2246.08s)]
*  And when I said iron and manganese, Leslie, I was talking about the majority of them. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2248.08s)]
*  We have had instances of other readings as well. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2252.08s)]
*  Well, I'm citing your own monitoring statistics, which do say that there have been hazardous chemicals [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2256.08s)]
*  that have entered the groundwater or surface water at all 14 plants by your own admission. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2262.08s)]
*  And what we have recommended and will be moving forward with and the state has recommended [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2269.08s)]
*  is further assessments so that appropriate steps can be taken. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2274.08s)]
*  So, Leslie, I think it's important to understand this. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2278.08s)]
*  Even you have to throw your head back and say further assessments. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2281.08s)]
*  But these results go back years. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2284.08s)]
*  And to say we need to study more, you know, is a very frustrating thing to have to hear. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2287.08s)]
*  And I'm not even a citizen of North Carolina. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2292.08s)]
*  We have very openly and transparently disclosed these results to work with the regulators [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2295.08s)]
*  to determine whether it really represents a risk. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2300.08s)]
*  Does Duke's coal ash today pose any health risk at all? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2303.08s)]
*  I believe our system is operating safely. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2311.08s)]
*  But local environmentalists showed us leaks from several of Duke's ash ponds, like this one at Cape Fear. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2314.08s)]
*  The stream is like this, leaking coal ash into the river 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2321.08s)]
*  After we asked state officials about this particular leak, lab tests were done, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2328.08s)]
*  showing notably elevated concentrations of sulfate, aluminum, iron, manganese, boron and strontium. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2332.08s)]
*  The state says the leak doesn't impact the overall health of the river, but is illegal, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2340.08s)]
*  a violation of the Clean Water Act. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2346.08s)]
*  Yet environmentalists like Frank Holloman say that over the years, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2349.08s)]
*  the state never forced Duke to clean up its ash ponds under both Democratic and Republican administrations. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2353.08s)]
*  How powerful is Duke Energy in the state of North Carolina? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2360.08s)]
*  It's the most powerful entity in the state of North Carolina. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2363.08s)]
*  It spends millions of dollars on political contributions, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2366.08s)]
*  and it has traditionally had a very close relationship with the state regulators. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2370.08s)]
*  Just this year, Governor McCrory cut the budget and staff of the specific department that inspects the ash ponds. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2375.08s)]
*  The state legislature did pass a law in August requiring Duke to clean up its plants, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2383.08s)]
*  but only after the company had already volunteered to do that. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2389.08s)]
*  Earlier, when Holloman tried to sue Duke, he was thwarted by the state, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2394.08s)]
*  which stepped in and negotiated a settlement that allowed Duke, you guessed it, more time to study, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2399.08s)]
*  and imposed only a paltry fine. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2406.08s)]
*  Tell everybody how much the fine was. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2409.08s)]
*  I don't have that list, but again... [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2411.08s)]
*  It was $99,111. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2413.08s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2416.08s)]
*  It does not sound like a big fine. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2417.08s)]
*  It wasn't a big fine. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2418.08s)]
*  All this has made federal prosecutors suspicious. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2419.08s)]
*  They have paneled a grand jury to investigate whether Duke or the regulators [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2423.08s)]
*  has done anything illegal to get the state to go easy on the company. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2428.08s)]
*  Virtually every newspaper in the state of North Carolina came out with editorials [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2432.08s)]
*  claiming that Duke was lax and lawless when it came to the environment [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2438.08s)]
*  and acted like a bully with state regulators. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2445.08s)]
*  I recognize that. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2449.08s)]
*  I disagree with that characterization. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2450.08s)]
*  It's been a challenging time, a difficult time, lots of voices weighing in, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2453.08s)]
*  certainly lots of scrutiny and criticism. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2457.08s)]
*  But you must take this to heart if there's so much of it, you know? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2459.08s)]
*  Of course we do. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2463.08s)]
*  We take this very seriously, and we're using this as an opportunity [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2465.08s)]
*  to raise our standards even higher to ensure that our operations are safe. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2468.08s)]
*  It's our highest priority at Duke. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2472.08s)]
*  Later this month, the Environmental Protection Agency is set to announce [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2475.08s)]
*  whether coal ash will be regulated by the federal government as hazardous waste, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2479.08s)]
*  meaning potentially much tougher disposal rules and oversight. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2484.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaJ6LIE8JQ&t=2502.08s)]
