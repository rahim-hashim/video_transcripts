# Saudi Arabia's Oil; Saudi Arabia and 9/11; Sportswashing | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [June 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM)
*  The good news is that the price of oil is falling a lot. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=0.0s)]
*  It's also the bad news if you're determined that the U.S. kick its addiction to foreign [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=18.32s)]
*  oil. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=22.84s)]
*  President-elect Barack Obama says now is the time to do that, even with the economy in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=24.44s)]
*  recession. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=29.0s)]
*  But the oil kingdom, Saudi Arabia, the world's largest supplier of oil, with the U.S. as [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=30.4s)]
*  its number one customer, is pulling all the levers and spending billions to keep the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=36.2s)]
*  oil age going. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=41.2s)]
*  We went to Saudi Arabia a few weeks ago to meet one of the most powerful men in the world, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=43.1s)]
*  Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister and de facto head of OPEC, the oil cartel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=47.92s)]
*  Most Americans had an opportunity to sit down with the oil minister of Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=56.0s)]
*  The thing they would like to know is where you think the price of oil is going to be, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  say, in about six months. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=66.88s)]
*  Is it going to be up or down? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=68.98s)]
*  You want my classic answer? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=72.08s)]
*  No, I want your honest appraisal and your judgment. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=74.08s)]
*  My honest judgment is if I were to know what the price of oil six months from now, I would [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=78.56s)]
*  be in Las Vegas. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=87.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=88.56s)]
*  He may be smiling, but this is a man with serious heartburn and vertigo. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=90.08s)]
*  The price of oil has been soaring and sinking up and down uncontrollably. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=95.26s)]
*  Why did the price, in your opinion, spike in July? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=100.62s)]
*  Why did it go way up to $147 a barrel? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=105.18s)]
*  Basically there was what's called a fear premium. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=109.86000000000001s)]
*  The fear was that Saudi Arabia itself had peeked out that you'd reached your ceiling [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=114.06s)]
*  of how much available oil is left in your overall reserve. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=123.22s)]
*  What's the truth? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=128.86s)]
*  The truth is here is the kingdom with more than 260 billion barrels, and I firmly believe [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=129.86s)]
*  that the potential to add another 200 billion barrels of oil are there to be found. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=140.38000000000002s)]
*  If the oil minister of Saudi Arabia had one message, it was there is no need for those [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  fears. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=154.3s)]
*  But to make the point, they let us see facilities that will increase Saudi capacity from about [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=156.02s)]
*  10 million barrels a day to more than 12 million. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=161.34s)]
*  And they're going to the ends of the earth to do it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=165.94s)]
*  This is Sheba, a desert wilderness where temperatures can reach 135 degrees. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  The Saudis say that 18 billion barrels of oil lie beneath these red sand dunes, more [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=176.4s)]
*  than four times the proven reserves of Alaska. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=181.9s)]
*  To tap into it, the kingdom's national oil company, Saudi Aramco, had to build an oasis [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=185.68s)]
*  here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=191.68s)]
*  The Sheba story is an amazing story. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=192.68s)]
*  Awayid al-Shammari oversees the mega project at Sheba here in the kingdom's empty quarter. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=195.84s)]
*  We're on soft sand. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=202.72s)]
*  We're not talking about a hard surface here. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=204.06s)]
*  Look, this is what it's like here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=206.36s)]
*  I mean, this is soft. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=208.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=210.44s)]
*  The logistics are impossible. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=211.44s)]
*  The first thing we had to do is build our own road in order to access this field. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=213.88s)]
*  Just to get here. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=218.04s)]
*  Just to get here. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=219.16s)]
*  Once that was done, we had to remove 100 million cubic feet of sand just to make the runway [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=220.16s)]
*  that we are currently using. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=228.0s)]
*  What? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=229.72s)]
*  100 million? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=230.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=231.72s)]
*  We had to remove a sand dune in order to connect two flat areas to do that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=232.72s)]
*  What about pipelines? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=237.2s)]
*  We built a pipeline 400 miles in length. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=238.85999999999999s)]
*  You can imagine the challenge of building that pipeline in a topography like this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=243.24s)]
*  But it was nothing compared to accessing the oil itself, which was discovered in 1968, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=248.28s)]
*  but for 30 years was considered too hard to extract. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  Now with sand dunes this high, it's almost impossible, and the economics just didn't [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=259.36s)]
*  make it at the time until the development of the horizontal drilling. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=265.92s)]
*  This is where you place a derrick on firm ground, then dig down with a drill bit that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=270.64s)]
*  snakes horizontally under the sand dunes with branching tentacles like a fish bone. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=276.12s)]
*  The drill bits can travel out for as much as five miles. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=282.32s)]
*  You know, when we were growing up, we always heard about the building of the pyramids. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=286.02s)]
*  This sounds like the building of the pyramids. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=291.14s)]
*  It was a huge task for everybody. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  The Sheba facility is now being expanded to extract a total of 750,000 barrels a day [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=296.16s)]
*  of high-grade Arab extra light crude. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=302.6s)]
*  And when will you see the first drop of oil out of the new part right behind you? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=306.36s)]
*  We will operate this facility very early next year. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=310.36s)]
*  So the beginning of 2009? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=313.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=315.68s)]
*  Then, on the other side of the kingdom, there's an even bigger mega project at a field known [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=316.68s)]
*  as Correus. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=323.32000000000005s)]
*  It's also scheduled to go online next year. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=324.98s)]
*  This is the biggest oil project in history. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  Khalid Abdul Qadar, the project manager, says 1.2 million barrels a day will be tapped here. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=331.3s)]
*  That's more than the entire daily production of some OPEC countries like Qatar and Indonesia. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=338.44s)]
*  This is a lot of walking. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=345.58000000000004s)]
*  The oil will be stored in massive tanks like this one, which is seven stories high. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=347.62s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=354.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=355.18s)]
*  We'll go down. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=356.18s)]
*  That is gigantic. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=357.18s)]
*  It's 300 feet across the length of a football field. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=359.65999999999997s)]
*  So can we go down? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=363.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=365.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=366.08s)]
*  Be careful. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=367.08s)]
*  Be very careful. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=368.08s)]
*  Like just about everything at Correus, even the tanks have the latest bells and whistles. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  This is a floating roof. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=376.88s)]
*  So when oil comes in, the whole roof will rise up. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=379.56s)]
*  Rise up? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=383.4s)]
*  Rise up, yes. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=384.4s)]
*  And the stair also will rise up with it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=385.4s)]
*  So in other words, we're standing on the roof of the tank and the oil will push it up? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=387.42s)]
*  Will push it up all the way up. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=393.12s)]
*  There's more oil in this one field at Correus than in the entire United States. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=396.36s)]
*  It's the largest oil facility to come online anywhere in the world in nearly three decades, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=401.48s)]
*  with the Saudis say, 27 billion barrels of oil. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=407.36s)]
*  Has anybody projected how many years it's going to take to deplete? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=411.42s)]
*  It will take us more than 50 years. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=415.08000000000004s)]
*  Fifty? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  Correus, like the sand dunes, presented a technological challenge. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  The field has very little natural pressure, which is necessary to bring the oil to the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  surface. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=427.88s)]
*  So to force the oil up, they're injecting seawater down deep underground. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=429.24s)]
*  We will inject about 84 million gallons per day of seawater. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=435.86s)]
*  So where's the seawater coming from? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  Because we're here in the middle of the desert. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=443.14s)]
*  How far away is the sea? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=446.26s)]
*  It is about 150 miles from here. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=448.18s)]
*  So in addition to all of this for the oil, you're also building a pipeline? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  A pipeline to get the additional water all the way to here. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=456.82s)]
*  The complexity and vastness of the project are staggering, with 26 contractors, 106 subcontractors, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=461.02000000000004s)]
*  and 22,000 workers from around the world who have laid thousands of miles of pipeline and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=469.1s)]
*  cables. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=475.66s)]
*  How much steel are you using here? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=476.98s)]
*  Because I'm looking. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=480.54s)]
*  It's just steel as far as I can see. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=481.68s)]
*  See, we have enough structural steel here that will build two bridges equal in size [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=484.98s)]
*  of the Golden Gate bridges in California. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=493.34s)]
*  Two? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=495.74s)]
*  Two. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=496.24s)]
*  These two megaprojects, plus three others, are costing Saudi Arabia a total of $60 billion [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=497.42s)]
*  over five years. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=503.38s)]
*  And they're not borrowing any of it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=504.92s)]
*  It's all being paid for in cash. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=506.9s)]
*  Still, Saudi costs for producing oil are the lowest in the world. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=509.74s)]
*  How much does it cost Saudi Arabia to produce one barrel of oil? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=515.1s)]
*  This is an excellent question. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=521.34s)]
*  It is very small, very little. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=522.78s)]
*  It's probably less than $2 to produce a barrel. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=526.38s)]
*  Saudi Arabia reportedly needs to sell oil for at least $55 a barrel to cover the cost [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=530.58s)]
*  of running the country. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=536.62s)]
*  Fossil Fuels financed 75% of its entire domestic spending budget. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=538.5s)]
*  But oil has sunk below that break-even price. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=543.66s)]
*  Does this worry you? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=547.5s)]
*  Does this send chills through your spine? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=548.7s)]
*  I am not a worrier. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=552.42s)]
*  I get concerned, but I don't worry. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=553.42s)]
*  Are you concerned? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=555.7s)]
*  The concern is this. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=556.74s)]
*  Any price must be good for the producer, for the consumer, for the investor, the oil companies. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=560.0s)]
*  So you're saying if the price goes too low, then production will fall, and in the end [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=568.42s)]
*  we'll be squeezed. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=574.18s)]
*  We won't have enough oil to run our country. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=575.18s)]
*  What he wants is an end to the wild swings in price, which is why, to keep the price [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=579.9799999999999s)]
*  from further plummeting, he agreed to a cut of 1.5 million barrels a day in the October [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=585.5799999999999s)]
*  meeting of OPEC, the oil cartel. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=592.04s)]
*  The point is that Saudi Arabia wanted the 1.5. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=594.96s)]
*  This was not something jammed down your throat. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=599.34s)]
*  No. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=601.84s)]
*  By the way, nothing gets jammed down our throat. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=602.84s)]
*  But Iran wanted more. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=608.22s)]
*  Well, I mean, different countries want different levels, different cuts. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=610.12s)]
*  But in the final analysis, reason prevails. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=617.32s)]
*  But are you saying that Saudi Arabia... [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  Influence on OPEC. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=624.2s)]
*  Influence so strong now that he was able to quash Iran's attempt to double the price of [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=627.1600000000001s)]
*  oil, which Tehran needs to support its budget, including its nuclear program and the bankrolling [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=632.4000000000001s)]
*  of militias like Hezbollah and Hamas. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=639.1600000000001s)]
*  Still, al-Naeimi says oil is no longer used as a weapon. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=642.1600000000001s)]
*  Iran tries to keep the price way up, and Venezuela's trying to keep the price way up. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=647.56s)]
*  You don't consider that oil as a weapon? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=653.52s)]
*  If you looked at these countries you just named, every one of them would like to sell [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=655.76s)]
*  every barrel they can. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=661.52s)]
*  As high a price as they can get away with. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=663.56s)]
*  The sense out of the OPEC meeting to a lot of people was by cutting production, your [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=666.16s)]
*  purpose was to get the price up again. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=672.3599999999999s)]
*  And that would hurt. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=675.88s)]
*  The world which is suffering an economic crisis, and the world means everywhere. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=677.18s)]
*  I can assure you that price was the least on our mind. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=682.42s)]
*  I say that in all honesty. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=689.7399999999999s)]
*  But the sense is you were oblivious to the concerns of the world facing this economic [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=692.5s)]
*  crisis. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=698.5799999999999s)]
*  You didn't care about the recession, the credit problems, or anything like that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=699.5799999999999s)]
*  That is really a very unfair criticism. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=705.14s)]
*  What did governments do when the financial crisis happened? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=708.5s)]
*  They took measures to bring stability back to the financial market. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=715.62s)]
*  And we see, because of our responsibility, a future crisis in the oil market. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=720.66s)]
*  Should we not take preemptive measures to prevent it? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=727.24s)]
*  And I think the answer is yes, we should. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=730.9s)]
*  It's incumbent on us not to see the oil market destroyed. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=733.42s)]
*  The Saudis recently announced the price they would like to see oil selling for. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=740.86s)]
*  $75 a barrel, about 50% higher than the current price. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=745.9s)]
*  Are they trying to keep the U.S. addicted to oil? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=751.3s)]
*  Their answer when we come back. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=754.42s)]
*  Saudi Aramco was originally an American company. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=763.42s)]
*  It goes way back to the 1930s when two American geologists from Standard Oil of California [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=771.9399999999999s)]
*  discovered oil in the Saudi desert. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=777.42s)]
*  Standard Oil formed a consortium with Texaco, Exxon, and Mobil, which became Aramco. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=780.5s)]
*  It wasn't until the 1980s that Saudi Arabia bought them out and nationalized the company. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=787.3s)]
*  Today, Saudi Aramco is the custodian of the country's sole source of wealth and power. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=793.78s)]
*  Saudi Aramco is a massive complex along the Persian Gulf, hundreds of miles east of the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=801.62s)]
*  megaprojects. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=807.4200000000001s)]
*  Over 16,000 people work here at the company's compound, which is like a little country, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=809.34s)]
*  with its own security force, schools, hospitals, even its own airline. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=814.86s)]
*  Abdallah Juma is president and CEO of Saudi Aramco. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=821.9s)]
*  So this is your headquarters. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=826.06s)]
*  This is our headquarters. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=827.06s)]
*  And how big is Aramco? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=828.98s)]
*  Saudi Aramco is the world's largest oil-producing company. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=830.7s)]
*  And it's the richest company in the world, worth, according to the latest estimate, $781 [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=835.04s)]
*  billion. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=840.94s)]
*  Oh, my. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=841.94s)]
*  This is the heart of our operation. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=842.94s)]
*  This is the nerve center. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=845.82s)]
*  It keeps going. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=848.46s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=849.46s)]
*  This is gigantic. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=850.74s)]
*  He gave us a tour of the company's command center, where engineers scrutinize and analyze [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=852.46s)]
*  every aspect of the company's operations on a 220-foot digital screen. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=858.54s)]
*  Every facility in the kingdom, every drop of oil that comes from the ground is monitored [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=863.98s)]
*  in real time. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=871.66s)]
*  In this room? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=873.38s)]
*  In this room. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=874.38s)]
*  And we have control of each and every facility, each and every pipeline, each and every valve [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=876.02s)]
*  on the pipeline. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=884.54s)]
*  And therefore, we know exactly what is happening in the system from A to Z. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=886.14s)]
*  What this map shows is all the oil fields in Saudi Arabia. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=893.18s)]
*  That big green blob in the middle is Gawar, the largest onshore oil field in the world. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=897.18s)]
*  And the one on top is Safania, the largest offshore oil field in the world. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=903.3399999999999s)]
*  And these green squares are supertankers that are being monitored on the high seas in real [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=909.4599999999999s)]
*  time. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=914.9799999999999s)]
*  So there's not anything that goes on with oil, with Saudi Arabian oil, that isn't known [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=916.06s)]
*  in this room right now? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=923.5799999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=925.2199999999999s)]
*  How much did this facility cost you? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=926.2199999999999s)]
*  A lot of money. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=929.14s)]
*  And what you see today is a company that is as professionally sound as any international [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=932.1s)]
*  oil company. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=941.1s)]
*  Before Ali al-Nayimi became oil minister, he ran Saudi Aramco for 11 years. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=942.66s)]
*  He was the first Saudi president and CEO. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=948.66s)]
*  You have, as you just said, one of the most efficient, cutting-edge, 21st century companies [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=951.58s)]
*  in the world, within one of the most religious, conservative countries in the world. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=959.74s)]
*  It's almost a paradox. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=965.86s)]
*  We were surprised by this. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=967.48s)]
*  I don't think there is any really surprise. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=969.6600000000001s)]
*  Many people have images of Saudi Arabia, but they really change their views and images [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=973.5s)]
*  when they come and visit Saudi Arabia. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=981.2600000000001s)]
*  But to Western eyes, it is a paradox. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=984.1s)]
*  Skyscrapers, traffic jams and shopping malls coexist with ancient tribal customs. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=987.1s)]
*  The king and the Koran reign supreme. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=994.1s)]
*  And women everywhere are required to cover themselves in black from head to toe. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=997.18s)]
*  Even I had to wear the abaya. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1002.42s)]
*  The rules apply everywhere, it seems, except for the women at Saudi Aramco. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1004.9399999999999s)]
*  When the U.S. oil companies came here in the 40s and 50s, the Americans moved into the [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1010.58s)]
*  area with their families and developed it to suit their tastes and their way of life. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1015.5400000000001s)]
*  They created a replica of American suburbia. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1021.94s)]
*  Today you could be in the outskirts of Houston or Los Angeles. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1025.78s)]
*  It's almost like an enclave within Saudi Arabia. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1030.38s)]
*  It's different from the rest of the country. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1036.42s)]
*  Yes, that's true. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1037.98s)]
*  Very different. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1038.98s)]
*  It kept a lot of the American ways. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1040.3s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1042.1s)]
*  But they are good ways. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1043.1s)]
*  They are good ways. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1044.1s)]
*  There is nothing wrong with these. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1045.1s)]
*  These are excellent ways. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1046.1s)]
*  But I was so surprised to see the culture there because, for instance, I saw men and [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1048.22s)]
*  women working side by side. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1054.74s)]
*  I saw women driving cars there, which you don't see. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1056.1s)]
*  It's not strange. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1059.98s)]
*  Not strange to him, he's a product of that culture, having risen through the ranks. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1062.06s)]
*  He started out as a 12-year-old office boy in 1947 when it was said that to get oil, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1067.46s)]
*  all you needed to do was ladle it out of the sand. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1073.5s)]
*  It was never that easy, according to Aramco CEO Juma. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1077.22s)]
*  It takes a lot of effort. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1082.0200000000002s)]
*  The oil is a gift from God. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1083.74s)]
*  The recovery of oil is really the work of men, and this is part of it here. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1086.8200000000002s)]
*  Here in this room, Aramco engineers are making sure that not one drop of oil is overlooked. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1093.54s)]
*  These computers are receiving data via satellite from sensors mounted on drill bits that are [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1100.06s)]
*  borrowing deep into the oil fields all over Saudi Arabia. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1106.38s)]
*  The engineers are sending IMs, instant messages, that actually guide the drill bits. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1110.74s)]
*  He is now directing that drill bit to go into the best areas of the reservoirs and [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1117.68s)]
*  suck that oil from it and not leave any oil behind. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1125.26s)]
*  So in other words, this drill bit's like a snake. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1130.1200000000001s)]
*  It doesn't go like that. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1133.3200000000002s)]
*  It would go down and then follow where the oil is. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1136.04s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1139.2s)]
*  And mind you, this is happening 400 to 500 miles from here geographically, and we are [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1140.2s)]
*  sending that drill bit also two or three miles in the ground. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1146.98s)]
*  Al Juma says with this technology, they're able to recover 10 times more oil than before. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1153.26s)]
*  But global demand is dwindling. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1160.66s)]
*  Even Americans, the world's leading gas guzzlers, are buying less. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1163.48s)]
*  In the last 10 months, Americans drove 78 billion fewer miles than they did in the 10 [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1168.06s)]
*  months last year, the same 10 months. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1177.82s)]
*  This is quite a dramatic decrease in driving. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1180.3s)]
*  To put it in better numbers, I think your consumption dropped by a million barrels. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1183.3799999999999s)]
*  Is there a thinking that this decrease in demand might be permanent? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1190.4199999999998s)]
*  No, no. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1197.02s)]
*  He says the U.S. is Saudi Arabia's number one customer, and the question is what will [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1198.8999999999999s)]
*  Aramco do to keep it that way? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1204.42s)]
*  One thing is discourage the move toward electric cars by trying to alleviate our concerns about [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1207.86s)]
*  the environment. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1213.86s)]
*  They showed us their new $4 million experimental combustion engine, which they hope will increase [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1216.02s)]
*  gas mileage while it lowers CO2 emissions. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1221.8s)]
*  What we want to see is that there is an emphasis on also making this oil greener and making [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1225.9s)]
*  the fossil fuels in general greener because they're going to be with us for the long haul. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1234.3000000000002s)]
*  Let me be blunt and ask you to be candid. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1240.8200000000002s)]
*  Is it Aramco's hope to prevent a switch away from oil? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1245.14s)]
*  He said the country is the oil business. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1253.34s)]
*  You absolutely need to do this for your own survival. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1256.02s)]
*  And what's wrong with that? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1260.22s)]
*  Well, I didn't say anything was wrong with it, but it's a fact. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1261.22s)]
*  You'd admit it's a fact. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1265.06s)]
*  Yeah, we admit a fact that yes, we depend on the oil industry. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1266.22s)]
*  We want it to help us to develop our economy and to develop the economy of the world. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1270.98s)]
*  So what is good for the well-being of Saudi Arabia should be good for the well-being of [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1276.54s)]
*  the world too. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1282.82s)]
*  So there's nothing wrong with that. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1284.1399999999999s)]
*  And so what do you say to people out there like Al Gore and now Mr. Obama that say we [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1285.7s)]
*  have to devote ourselves, devote ourselves to reducing our dependence on oil? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1294.52s)]
*  My answer to this is we have to be realistic. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1300.74s)]
*  We don't have the alternatives today. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1304.28s)]
*  If there are alternatives, be my guest and come and bring them in. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1306.92s)]
*  But they are not there. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1310.3999999999999s)]
*  You're saying whatever the world does in terms of wind, nuclear, coal, we're still going [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1311.72s)]
*  to need oil. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1318.28s)]
*  You're still going to need oil and a lot of it. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1319.28s)]
*  Politicians use this all the time that we're addicted, addicted to foreign oil. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1324.6399999999999s)]
*  An addiction has a dark connotation because if you're addicted, there's a suggestion [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1331.36s)]
*  that there's a drug dealer who's trying to keep you hooked. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1336.32s)]
*  It's in the air that you want to keep us hooked. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1340.84s)]
*  There is nothing addictive about oil. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1345.36s)]
*  If you look back 100 years, what would the world be without it? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1350.58s)]
*  Even President Bush was an oil man. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1356.28s)]
*  Even he has said we're addicted to this and we have to get off this oil. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1359.56s)]
*  But listen to what the professionals say and what do they advise. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1364.3600000000001s)]
*  It's not going to happen today. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1369.72s)]
*  It's not going to happen 10 years from now. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1371.8400000000001s)]
*  It's probably not going to happen 20 years from now. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1374.24s)]
*  It's not going to happen 30 years from now. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1377.0s)]
*  Because you're still going to be using fossil fuels. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1380.78s)]
*  Rather than oil pushers, the Saudis see themselves as good global citizens who are trying to [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1385.1599999999999s)]
*  save the world from a catastrophic oil shortage. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1390.32s)]
*  But as oil minister Al Naimi told us, the kingdom is hedging its bets. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1393.72s)]
*  We in Saudi Arabia are developing solar energy. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1399.32s)]
*  Solar energy? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1404.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1405.56s)]
*  You're doing research in solar energy? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1406.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1407.56s)]
*  Where else is the solar energy the most intense? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1408.56s)]
*  The desert. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1412.52s)]
*  So won't that hurt your oil industry? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1415.24s)]
*  No. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1417.24s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1418.24s)]
*  It will supplement it. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1419.24s)]
*  Our vision is that we will be exporters of gigawatts of electricity. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1422.24s)]
*  We will be exporting both. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1431.24s)]
*  Ok. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1433.24s)]
*  And what was not? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1434.24s)]
*  Bars of oil and gigawatts of power. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1435.24s)]
*  And so he says, the kingdom will still be in the energy business long after the sun [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1439.36s)]
*  sets on the age of oil. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1444.24s)]
*  In 10 days, President Obama will visit Saudi Arabia at a time of deep mistrust between [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1459.7199999999998s)]
*  the two allies and lingering doubts about the Saudi commitment to fighting violent [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1465.08s)]
*  Islamic extremism. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1469.6799999999998s)]
*  It also comes at a time when the White House and intelligence officials are reviewing whether [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1471.84s)]
*  to declassify one of the country's most sensitive documents, known as the 28 pages. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1476.56s)]
*  They have to do with 9-11 and the possible existence of a Saudi support network for the [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1482.52s)]
*  hijackers while they were in the U.S. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1487.3999999999999s)]
*  For 13 years, the 28 pages have been locked away in a secret vault. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1490.52s)]
*  Only a small group of people have ever seen them. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1495.16s)]
*  Tonight, you'll hear from some of the people who have read them and believe, along with [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1497.56s)]
*  the families of 9-11 victims, that they should be declassified. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1501.72s)]
*  I think it is implausible to believe that 19 people, most of whom didn't speak English, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1506.12s)]
*  most of whom had never been in the United States before, many of whom didn't have a [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1511.8s)]
*  high school education, could have carried out such a complicated task without some support [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1515.48s)]
*  from within the United States. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1521.88s)]
*  And you believe that the 28 pages are crucial to this understanding? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1523.68s)]
*  I think they are a key part. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1527.0800000000002s)]
*  Former U.S. Senator Bob Graham has been trying to get the 28 pages released since the day [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1530.0800000000002s)]
*  they were classified back in 2003, when he played a major role in the first government [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1535.0400000000002s)]
*  investigation into 9-11. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1541.26s)]
*  I remain deeply disturbed by the amount of material that has been censored from this [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1543.28s)]
*  report. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1548.6s)]
*  At the time, Graham was chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and co-chair [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1549.92s)]
*  of the bipartisan Joint Congressional Inquiry into intelligence failures surrounding the [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1557.52s)]
*  attacks. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1562.68s)]
*  The Joint Inquiry reviewed a half a million documents, interviewed hundreds of witnesses [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1563.68s)]
*  and produced an 838-page report, minus the final chapter, which was blanked out, excised [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1569.2s)]
*  by the Bush administration for reasons of national security. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1576.28s)]
*  So this is your office? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1579.8799999999999s)]
*  Bob Graham won't discuss the classified information in the 28 pages. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1581.36s)]
*  He will say only that they outline a network of people that he believes supported the hijackers [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1585.6s)]
*  while they were in the U.S. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1591.0s)]
*  You believe that support came from Saudi Arabia? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1593.04s)]
*  Substantially. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1595.92s)]
*  When we say the Saudis, you mean the government, rich people in the country, charities? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1596.92s)]
*  All of the above. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1602.16s)]
*  Graham and others believe the Saudi role has been soft-pedaled to protect a delicate relationship [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1604.2s)]

*  These are some, but not all, of the facts. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1785.26s)]
*  In January of 2000, the first of the hijackers landed in Los Angeles after attending an al-Qaeda [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1788.26s)]
*  summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1794.88s)]
*  The two Saudi nationals, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Midar, arrived with extremely limited [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1798.1000000000001s)]
*  language skills and no experience with Western culture. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1804.42s)]
*  Yet through an incredible series of circumstances, they managed to get everything they needed [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1808.46s)]
*  from housing to flight lessons. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1813.74s)]
*  LA, San Diego, that's really the hornet's nest. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1816.02s)]
*  That's really the one that I continue to think about almost on a daily basis. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1820.62s)]
*  During their first days in LA, witnesses placed the two future hijackers at the King Fahd [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1826.54s)]
*  Mosque in the company of Fahd al-Thumari, a diplomat at the Saudi consulate known to [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1831.34s)]
*  hold extremist views. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1837.22s)]
*  Later, 9-11 investigators would find him deceptive and suspicious, and in 2003, he would be [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1839.5s)]
*  denied reentry to the United States for having suspected ties to terrorist activity. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1846.22s)]
*  This is a very interesting person in the whole 9-11 episode of who might have helped him [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1851.86s)]
*  in Los Angeles and San Diego with two terrorists who didn't know their way around. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1858.3799999999999s)]
*  Stone records show that Thumari was also in regular contact with this man, Omar al-Bayoumi, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1864.6200000000001s)]
*  a mysterious Saudi who became the hijackers' biggest benefactor. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1869.6200000000001s)]
*  He was a ghost employee with a no-show job at a Saudi aviation contractor outside Los [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1874.5800000000002s)]

*  You believe Bayoumi was a Saudi agent. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1884.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1885.94s)]
*  What makes you believe that? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1886.94s)]
*  Well, for one thing, he'd been listed even before 9-11 in FBI files as being a Saudi [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1887.94s)]
*  agent. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1893.26s)]
*  On the morning of February 1, 2000, Bayoumi went to the office of the Saudi consulate [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1894.62s)]
*  where Thumari worked. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1899.7s)]
*  He then proceeded to have lunch at a Middle Eastern restaurant on Venice Boulevard, where [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1901.62s)]
*  he later claimed he just happened to make the acquaintance of the two future hijackers. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1906.26s)]
*  Hazmi and Midhar magically run into Bayoumi in a restaurant that Bayoumi claims is a coincidence [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1911.7s)]
*  in one of the biggest cities in the United States. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1920.04s)]
*  And he decides to befriend them. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1922.4199999999998s)]
*  He decides to not only befriend them, but then to help them move to San Diego and get [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1923.9399999999998s)]
*  residence. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1929.6999999999998s)]
*  In San Diego, Bayoumi found them a place to live in his own apartment complex, advanced [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1931.28s)]
*  them the security deposit, and co-signed the lease. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1936.3s)]
*  He even threw them a party and introduced them to other Muslims who would help the hijackers [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1939.78s)]
*  obtain government IDs and enroll in English classes and flight schools. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1945.1399999999999s)]
*  There's no evidence that Bayoumi or Thumari knew what the future hijackers were up to, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1950.42s)]
*  and it is possible that they were just trying to help fellow Muslims. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1955.7s)]
*  But the very day Bayoumi welcomed the hijackers to San Diego, there were four calls between [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1959.6200000000001s)]
*  his cell phone and the imam at a San Diego mosque. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1964.94s)]
*  Anwar al-Awlaki, a name that should sound familiar. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1968.5400000000002s)]
*  America cannot and will not win. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1973.0600000000002s)]
*  The American-born al-Awlaki would be infamous a decade later as al-Qaeda's chief propagandist [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1976.18s)]
*  and top operative in Yemen until he was taken out by a CIA drone. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1981.46s)]
*  But in January 2001, a year after becoming the hijacker's spiritual advisor, he left [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1986.42s)]
*  San Diego for False Church, Virginia. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1992.26s)]
*  Months later, Hasmi, Midar, and three more hijackers would join him there. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=1995.5s)]
*  Those are a lot of coincidences, and that's a lot of smoke. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2000.46s)]
*  Is that enough to make you squirm and uncomfortable and dig harder and declassify these 28 pages? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2003.9399999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2011.26s)]
*  Perhaps no one is more interested in reading the 28 pages than attorneys Jim Kreindler [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2012.8999999999999s)]
*  and Sean Carter, who represent family members of the 9-11 victims in their lawsuit against [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2017.9399999999998s)]
*  the kingdom, alleging that its institutions provided money to al-Qaeda knowing that it [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2023.5s)]
*  was waging war against the United States. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2028.8999999999999s)]
*  What we're doing in court is developing the story that has to come out. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2031.86s)]
*  But it's been difficult for us because for many years we weren't getting the kind of [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2038.54s)]
*  openness and cooperation that we think our government owes to the American people, particularly [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2043.3799999999999s)]
*  the families of people who are murdered. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2050.66s)]
*  The U.S. government has even backed the Saudi position in court that it can't be sued because [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2053.52s)]
*  it enjoys sovereign immunity. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2058.58s)]
*  The 9-11 Commission report says that Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2061.02s)]
*  source of al-Qaeda funding through its wealthy citizens and charities with significant government [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2065.7000000000003s)]
*  sponsorship. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2071.26s)]
*  But the sentence that got the most attention when the report came out is this. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2072.7400000000002s)]
*  We have found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2077.3s)]
*  individually funded the organization. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2083.3s)]
*  Attorney Sean Carter says it's the most carefully crafted line in the 9-11 Commission report [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2086.9s)]
*  and the most misunderstood. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2091.54s)]
*  When they say that we found no evidence that senior Saudi officials individually funded [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2093.54s)]
*  al-Qaeda, they conspicuously leave open the potential that they found evidence that people [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2097.9s)]
*  who were officials that they did not regard as senior officials had done so. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2102.14s)]
*  That is the essence of the families' lawsuit, that elements of the government and lower-level [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2106.46s)]
*  officials sympathetic to bin Laden's cause helped al-Qaeda carry out the attacks and [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2111.66s)]
*  help sustain the al-Qaeda network. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2116.9s)]
*  Yet for more than a decade, the kingdom has maintained that that one sentence exonerated [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2119.46s)]
*  it of any responsibility for 9-11, regardless of what might be in the 28 pages. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2124.2599999999998s)]
*  It's not an exoneration. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2130.14s)]
*  But we said we did not, with this report, exonerate the Saudis. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2131.14s)]
*  Former U.S. Senator Bob Kerry is another of the 10-member 9-11 Commission who has read [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2137.5s)]
*  the 28 pages and believes they should be declassified. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2142.38s)]
*  He filed an affidavit in support of the 9-11 family's lawsuit. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2146.5s)]
*  You can't provide the money for terrorists and then say I don't have anything to do with [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2150.82s)]
*  what they were doing. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2154.22s)]
*  Do you believe that all of the leads that were developed in the 28 pages were answered [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2155.22s)]
*  in the 9-11 report, all the questions? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2159.62s)]
*  No. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2161.3s)]
*  In general, the 9-11 Commission did not get every single detail of the conspiracy. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2162.3s)]

*  These are two international superstars and you're not watching them on TV. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2747.0s)]
*  You're watching them live here. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2750.68s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2752.24s)]
*  I would never imagine that me going to the fight, driving my car and attending the fight [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2753.24s)]
*  in my own country. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2758.48s)]

*  You're saying this is window dressing. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2829.5s)]
*  This is cosmetic. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2831.56s)]
*  Behind the games there's mass executions and repression like never before. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2834.3599999999997s)]
*  Absolutely, exactly. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2838.6s)]
*  This is what's happening. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2840.0s)]
*  The cultural shift goes beyond sports. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2842.68s)]

*  Very exciting times. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2874.24s)]
*  In his career in hospitality and entertainment, Enzorillo launched Atlantis in the Bahamas. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2875.96s)]
*  Name a global celebrity and be assured, Jerry has made their acquaintance. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2883.16s)]
*  I've done five decades in tourism. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2888.04s)]
*  My job is to welcome people and to create joy and festivity. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2890.92s)]

*  Today he oversees a massive $63 billion development on the site where the Saudi state was born, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2899.32s)]

*  We asked Enzorillo about his comfort level representing this autocracy. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2913.32s)]
*  He told us he focuses on the positive. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2917.64s)]
*  You know, I went to school in Las Vegas and there's a gambling term that when you're way [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2921.08s)]

*  Who Brung You? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2936.04s)]
*  Who Brung Me Here? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2937.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2938.04s)]
*  Vision 2030, a very benevolent, very love king and a very visionary, dynamic crown prince. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2939.04s)]
*  But it's the less noble doings of the crown prince that have stained the country's reputation, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2945.76s)]
*  both accelerating and complicating its foray into sports. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2950.4s)]
*  A CIA report said MBS approved the 2018 assassination and dismembering of Washington Post journalist [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2954.48s)]
*  Jamel Khashoggi. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2960.88s)]
*  Under MBS's rule, executions have drastically increased, including a mass beheading of 81 [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2962.76s)]
*  people in one day last March. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2968.5600000000004s)]
*  The mildest criticism of the state, even on Twitter, has been met with detention, torture [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2971.2s)]
*  and long and arbitrary prison sentences. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2976.68s)]
*  We've heard a lot about transition. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2979.56s)]
*  We've seen it with our own eyes. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2981.68s)]
*  But the concern is that this country right now is still not fit to hold international [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2983.16s)]
*  sporting events. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2986.8799999999997s)]
*  We're not saying that we're perfect, but what I'm trying to say is that these things help [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2988.08s)]
*  us to achieve a better future for our population. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2991.7s)]
*  I think no country would say they're perfect. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2995.3199999999997s)]
*  Are you saying that every country has a leader that, according to the CIA, has ordered the [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=2998.88s)]
*  murder of a journalist? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3004.2400000000002s)]
*  Are you saying that every country has 81 beheadings in a single day? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3005.2400000000002s)]
*  And if the answer is no, doesn't it make this relative argument, this what about-ism, doesn't [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3008.8s)]
*  it make that irrelevant? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3013.32s)]
*  Well, what I'm trying to say is that let's look at the good side about this. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3014.88s)]
*  And you know, you're just pinpointing certain topics that if we had the mass shooting a [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3019.44s)]
*  couple of weeks ago in the U.S., does that mean that we don't host the World Cup in the [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3025.04s)]
*  U.S.? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3028.48s)]
*  No, we should go to the U.S., we should get people together. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3029.48s)]
*  Mass shooting is not a government actor, let's be clear about that. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3031.52s)]
*  Still, whatever, people died. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3034.0800000000004s)]
*  But what I'm trying to say is that if we look at only the bad side, then we shouldn't do [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3036.0800000000004s)]
*  anything. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3040.48s)]
*  Are they not universal? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3041.48s)]
*  So they're not basic thresholds you think need to be met? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3042.48s)]
*  As I said, there's a lot of issues with a lot of countries. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3045.52s)]
*  But then you mentioned that the order came from the Crown Prince, and that's not true. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3048.0800000000004s)]
*  There's no proof of that as we speak. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3051.6400000000003s)]
*  You're denying that the CIA's report that says this was ordered and approved. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3055.0s)]
*  I don't think the CIA report actually says that, if you look at it. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3057.36s)]
*  The CIA report concluded Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved an operation [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3061.7200000000003s)]
*  to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3068.6s)]
*  Finally, they collide. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3072.76s)]
*  Still, the games go on. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3074.8s)]
*  So do the choices. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3076.88s)]
*  Just last month, FIFA, soccer's governing body not known for occupying ethical high [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3078.7999999999997s)]

*  offer for this summer's Women's World Cup. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3089.4s)]
*  These moral dilemmas will only intensify. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3092.92s)]
*  When we were in Saudi Arabia, we saw a top-level tennis event, a top-level golf event had just [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3096.12s)]
*  been held. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3101.08s)]
*  Bruno Mars had given a concert. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3102.2799999999997s)]
*  What would your message be to the athletes and entertainers who are coming in to perform [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3104.4s)]
*  and compete? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3109.08s)]
*  My message is that why would you go to Saudi Arabia and stay silent on what is going on [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3110.08s)]
*  on the ground? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3115.6800000000003s)]
*  Why won't you speak on behalf of the prisoners who have been muzzled and all the families [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3116.6800000000003s)]
*  that cannot speak? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3122.0s)]
*  Because when you go to Saudi Arabia, you are part of discovering a machine. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3123.2400000000002s)]
*  What do you think the purpose is of throwing around billions and billions of dollars into [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3129.44s)]
*  sports like this? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3133.06s)]
*  I think the Saudi government, the Saudi regime and MBS, he wants people to think of Ronaldo [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3134.2s)]
*  when they think about Saudi and not about Khashoggi. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3140.8799999999997s)]
*  That's become the association now. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3143.8799999999997s)]
*  We've gone from the murder journalist to the star soccer player. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3145.3599999999997s)]
*  Absolutely, unfortunately. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHv0Fjq3GTM&t=3148.52s)]
