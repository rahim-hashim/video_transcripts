# The Rule of Law; Freezing the Biological Clock | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y)
*  Someone must stand up to this because it is a direct attack on the whole functioning of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  our judicial system. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  President Trump is threatening law firms with destruction through his executive orders. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  But some are fighting and winning so far in court. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=21.22s)]
*  So of course I am worried. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=25.92s)]
*  I'd be an idiot not to be worried. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=27.52s)]
*  The question though is what do you do? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=29.94s)]
*  Let's get some eggs. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=31.78s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=34.38s)]
*  Let's get some eggs. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=35.38s)]
*  More and more American women are freezing their eggs to preserve their fertility. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=36.38s)]
*  Those are the eggs. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=41.7s)]
*  Could egg freezing offer what previous generations only dreamed of? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=42.7s)]
*  The chance to put the biological clock on ice. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=47.14s)]
*  There definitely is that TikTok clock and I'm not ready quite yet. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=51.540000000000006s)]
*  I think that egg freezing is as revolutionary as the pill was in 1960s and 70s. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=56.58s)]
*  It's as revolutionary as the pill. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=62.26s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=66.46s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=68.02s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=69.38s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=70.62s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=72.02s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=73.3s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=74.62s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=75.98s)]
*  It was nearly impossible to get anyone on camera for this story because of the fear [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=87.5s)]
*  now running through our system of justice. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=94.18s)]
*  In recent weeks, President Trump has signed orders against several law firms, orders with [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=97.38000000000001s)]
*  the power to destroy them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=103.18s)]
*  That matters because lawsuits have been a check on the president's power. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=105.56s)]
*  Many firms and attorneys have been targeted. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=110.04s)]
*  Among them, Mark Elias, a longtime opponent of Trump, who is the only lawyer the president [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=112.86s)]
*  has named who was willing to appear on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=119.14s)]
*  Elias and others are warning that Trump's assault on the legal profession threatens [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=123.3s)]
*  the rule of law itself. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=128.98s)]
*  Elias says that for him, it began with the president's personal grudge. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=131.9s)]
*  Donald Trump hates me because I fight hard and I fight for free and fair elections. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=139.06s)]
*  I insist on fighting for democracy in court, fighting for voting rights in court, and insist [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=143.62s)]
*  on telling the truth about what the outcome of the 2020 election was. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=148.78s)]
*  Are there risks in doing the work that you're doing? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=152.08s)]
*  I'd be an idiot not to be worried. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=155.22s)]
*  The question though is what do you do? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=157.34s)]
*  Do you just cower in the corner? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=159.66000000000003s)]
*  Do you just try to disappear? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=161.26000000000002s)]
*  Do you just leave democracy to fend for itself? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=162.26000000000002s)]
*  Or do you stand tall and do the best you can every day to represent your clients and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=164.94s)]
*  try to preserve the rule of law? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=169.3s)]
*  Mark Elias first crossed Trump in 2016. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  He was the top lawyer for the Clinton campaign. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=175.38s)]
*  Then in 2020, when Trump and allies challenged the election results, Elias fought in court [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=179.7s)]
*  and won. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=186.36s)]
*  Trump calls him a thug. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=188.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is the walking embodiment of everything that is wrong with the American [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=190.42s)]
*  political system. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  And so when Donald Trump says that I am unethical or that I am undermining his vision of America, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=196.5s)]
*  I say, boy, I must be doing something right. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=203.1s)]
*  Elias was top of mind for Trump this past March, both he and another lawyer who had [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=205.77999999999997s)]
*  once investigated the president. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=211.98s)]
*  With the help of radicals like Mark Elias, Mark Pomerantz, and these are people that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=214.34s)]
*  nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  So many others. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  But these are people that are bad people, really bad people. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=226.38s)]
*  They tried to turn America into a corrupt communist and third world country. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=231.1s)]
*  But in the end, the thugs failed and the truth won. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=237.3s)]
*  Beginning in February, the president signed the orders attacking the law firms. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=241.5s)]
*  Wait, I just want to savor this one, please. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=246.3s)]
*  Six firms in six weeks, including Mark Elias's former firm. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=249.26s)]
*  Each had a connection to an investigation or legal case related to Trump or his allies, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=255.04s)]
*  including Robert Mueller's 2017 probe of Russian election meddling, subversion of the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=262.22s)]
*  2020 election, and alleged mishandling of classified documents. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=268.98s)]
*  This is an absolute honor to sign. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  What they've done is just terrible. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=278.1s)]
*  Targeted firms say what the president signed amounted to a corporate death penalty. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=282.34000000000003s)]
*  And it should never be allowed to happen again. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=287.86s)]
*  The orders threatened to bar attorneys from where they work, courthouses and federal agencies, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=291.1s)]
*  and cancel the contracts of law firm clients. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=298.74s)]
*  For example, an aerospace company could lose its federal contracts if it stayed with the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=303.26s)]
*  firm. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=309.14s)]
*  A senior partner at one firm told us the president's orders were, quote, diabolical, intended to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=310.62s)]
*  bankrupt us. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=317.22s)]
*  He said within hours, his major clients were threatening to drop his firm. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=318.88s)]
*  It took only a matter of days before America's wealthiest and most powerful law firms buckled. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=324.98s)]
*  In a shock to the legal community, nine major firms went to the White House to make a deal. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=334.14000000000004s)]
*  Some say they were pressured not by a written order, but by a message from the White House [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=340.66s)]
*  threatening an order. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=346.6s)]
*  He's trying to intimidate them, the way in which a mob boss intimidates people in the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=347.86s)]
*  neighborhood that he is seeking to either exact protection money from or engage in other [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=353.26s)]
*  nefarious conduct. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=359.26s)]
*  I mean, the fact is that these law firms are being told, if you don't play ball with us, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=360.26s)]
*  maybe something really bad will happen to you. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=366.54s)]
*  The nine firms did not admit wrongdoing, but altogether, they agreed to give nearly $1 [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=369.22s)]
*  billion in legal services to causes that the firms and Trump support. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=376.02s)]
*  Our whole system of government is at stake. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=382.78s)]
*  Attorney Donald Ayer should know. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=385.65999999999997s)]
*  He argued before the Supreme Court for the Reagan administration. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=388.06s)]
*  He was deputy attorney general for George H.W. Bush. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=392.18s)]
*  And that's their argument. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=396.21999999999997s)]
*  Today, he teaches at Georgetown Law. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=397.21999999999997s)]
*  The idea that the president would issue executive orders aimed at any either specific person [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=400.41999999999996s)]
*  or organization and stating that they're being punished because they're doing things [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=407.26s)]
*  that are politically disapproved by the people in power. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=413.9s)]
*  That is completely unprecedented. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=418.46s)]
*  Nobody has that right, including the president? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=420.78s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=423.53999999999996s)]
*  I think the president's an elected person, and he has the right to do a great many things. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=424.86s)]
*  But he doesn't have the right to essentially cancel out your right to have a lawyer of [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=430.98s)]
*  your choosing represent you in court by scaring the lawyer through threats that their personal [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=436.14s)]
*  livelihood will be destroyed. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=442.06s)]
*  Now America's legal community is torn between those who want to fight and those who made [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=444.7s)]
*  a deal. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=450.06s)]
*  One firm that reached an agreement with Trump was Skadden Arps, where attorney Brenna Frey [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=451.5s)]
*  resigned in protest. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=458.26s)]
*  I think the message it sends to the country is power is what matters. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=460.02s)]
*  If you have power, you can exercise that power however you want. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=465.9s)]
*  And if that's true, why have a legal system at all? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=470.46s)]
*  Why have law firms or lawyers at all? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=474.17999999999995s)]
*  You thought that Skadden would fight? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=477.09999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=479.29999999999995s)]
*  Why did you think so? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=480.29999999999995s)]
*  Because that's a foundational principle of the firm, that we are zealous advocates for [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=481.58s)]
*  the law. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=487.53999999999996s)]
*  Why did this mean so much to you that you felt you had to quit? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=488.73999999999995s)]
*  The law firm is tacitly saying, we'll listen to the administration. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=492.78s)]
*  We won't fight in court. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=496.85999999999996s)]
*  If we won't fight over this, what else won't we fight over in court against the federal [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=498.65999999999997s)]
*  government? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=502.38s)]
*  In a note to its staff, Skadden Arps called its deal with Trump extraordinarily difficult, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=503.85999999999996s)]
*  but the best path to protect our clients, our people, and our firm. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=511.44s)]
*  I think that they're naive if they think this makes the issue go away. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=516.6999999999999s)]
*  Naive? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=521.5s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=522.66s)]
*  There was nothing in these agreements that prevents the president from issuing another [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=523.66s)]
*  executive order against the law firm in the future. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=531.66s)]
*  Someone must stand up to this because it is a direct attack on the whole functioning of [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=535.58s)]
*  our judicial system. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=541.9s)]
*  Four firms are standing up and fighting in court. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=543.9s)]
*  Judges protected them with temporary restraining orders. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=547.82s)]
*  That Professor Donald Ayer says in his view, Trump's orders violate the constitutional [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=551.74s)]
*  rights to free speech, due process, and the right to counsel. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=557.4s)]
*  Everyone's got a right to a lawyer. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=562.98s)]
*  Everyone's got a right to go to court. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=564.5s)]
*  And it's something we've always assumed to be true, and now it's threatened. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=566.1s)]
*  So if the president targets a few specific law firms, the message to law firms across [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=569.98s)]
*  the country in a nutshell is what? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=575.96s)]
*  I think the message is that this can happen to you. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=578.52s)]
*  But it's a real effort to prevent zealous representation of your client's legal interests [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=581.5799999999999s)]
*  when that results in something unacceptable to the administration. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=587.8s)]
*  You're at the mercy of the government, and it really is like a protection racket. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=592.4399999999999s)]
*  John Kecker is a prominent attorney and Democrat in San Francisco. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=597.88s)]
*  You're not suggesting that the president's running a protection racket. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=603.16s)]
*  I am. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=606.56s)]
*  I'm suggesting that he is violating the rule that says you can't offer a thing of value [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=607.76s)]
*  in return for an official act. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=616.3199999999999s)]
*  That happens to be the definition of bribery. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=618.66s)]
*  Anybody else who came to Washington and said, I will give you $100 million of free legal [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=621.4s)]
*  services if you do this for me, would be convicted of a bribe. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=627.6999999999999s)]
*  Kecker is helping recruit law firms nationwide to fight back. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=632.52s)]
*  More than 500 firms, large and small, have signed up in support. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=637.12s)]
*  We don't have to agree on politics, but we do have to agree that the legal profession [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=642.26s)]
*  has to protect the rule of law in the United States, which means lawyers and judges need [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=649.0s)]
*  to be independent from the executive branch. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=655.58s)]
*  If the president brings the legal profession to heel, what situation is the country in then? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=658.48s)]
*  You're in a rule of law. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=666.14s)]
*  You're in a dictatorship. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=667.14s)]
*  That's what happened in China. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=668.14s)]
*  It happened in Russia. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=670.18s)]
*  These are legal systems that look like legal systems, but in fact are controlled by a dictatorship. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=672.3s)]
*  I just think that the law firms have to behave themselves. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=680.04s)]
*  Trump's attack on the law firms has been described by a federal judge as a personal vendetta. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=683.98s)]
*  None of his targets is charged with any crime. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=689.9399999999999s)]
*  Trump, however, was indicted by federal grand juries in cases about the 2020 election and [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=693.7s)]
*  allegedly concealing classified documents. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=700.9200000000001s)]
*  He pleaded not guilty. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=704.24s)]
*  Those prosecutions were dropped only because he was reelected. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=706.4200000000001s)]
*  Last year, a state jury convicted him of falsifying business records, making him the first felon [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=711.94s)]
*  in the Oval Office. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=719.74s)]
*  I've been targeted for four years, longer than that. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=721.34s)]
*  So you don't tell me about targeting. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=725.1s)]
*  I was the target of corrupt politicians for four years and then four years after that. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=726.58s)]
*  So don't talk to me about targeting. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=733.86s)]
*  In Trump's defense, government lawyers argue in court that his orders against the firms [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=736.26s)]
*  ensure that tax money is not supporting unlawful or unsavory practices. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=742.94s)]
*  Other filing says the executive branch is merely managing who it does business with, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=750.4s)]
*  not punishing anyone. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  And the government argues that the orders are, quote, well within the scope of presidential [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=758.72s)]
*  prerogative. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=764.68s)]
*  Well, the law firms all want to make deals. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=765.68s)]
*  You mean the law firms that we're going after that went after me for four years ruthlessly, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  violently, illegally? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=772.72s)]
*  I mean, are those the law firms you're talking about? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=773.72s)]
*  They're not babies. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=776.52s)]
*  They're very sophisticated people. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=777.52s)]
*  Those law firms did bad things, bad things. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=780.32s)]
*  They went after me for years. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=783.88s)]
*  Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=785.88s)]
*  All the hoax. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=788.2s)]
*  What Trump means by a hoax were allegations in 2016 of shady dealings with Russia by Trump [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=789.6800000000001s)]
*  and his campaign. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=797.1600000000001s)]
*  He's right that the FBI could not corroborate what was described as rumor. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=799.0s)]
*  One allegation was promoted to the media by Clinton campaign representatives when Mark [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=806.18s)]
*  Elias was general counsel. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=812.18s)]
*  In this memo six weeks ago, Trump says Elias is an example of grossly unethical misconduct. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=814.78s)]
*  The president directs the attorney general to seek sanctions against any lawyer anywhere [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=823.38s)]
*  for unreasonable and vexatious litigation against the government. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=830.18s)]
*  Unreasonable, apparently, in the eye of the president. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=835.18s)]
*  Are we reaching a point where a person will go to a law firm with a case that is opposed [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=839.38s)]
*  to the president of the United States and the law firm will think, do we really want [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=845.5799999999999s)]
*  to take this case? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=850.38s)]
*  We're already there. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=851.8599999999999s)]
*  They are deciding not to take on certain kinds of clients that might upset the administration [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=852.8599999999999s)]
*  or not taking on certain kinds of causes that might put them in the crosshairs of the administration. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=858.62s)]
*  If lawyers give up their independence, what is lost? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=864.02s)]
*  The rule of law. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=868.6999999999999s)]
*  And this is why the business community ought to care. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=869.6999999999999s)]
*  Today it might be that Donald Trump thinks he can take over the election system through [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=871.9399999999999s)]
*  one of his executive orders. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=877.1999999999999s)]
*  Tomorrow, maybe it's the banking system. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=878.5799999999999s)]
*  After that, maybe it's contracts. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=880.68s)]
*  Maybe he decrees, I'm going to decide which contracts are binding and which contracts [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=882.06s)]
*  aren't binding. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=885.18s)]
*  So the legal system is fundamental to how our society operates, how capitalism operates, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=886.3s)]
*  and everyone should have a stake in that. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=892.42s)]
*  Conservative law professor Donald Ayer is optimistic the courts will strike down the [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=895.42s)]
*  president's orders. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=900.66s)]
*  The question then, he told us, is whether Trump will obey. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=902.0s)]
*  This is a very big deal. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=906.8s)]
*  What's happening now is a very big deal. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=908.38s)]
*  It's a whole other chapter in our history, and we need to call upon the values that have [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=910.3s)]
*  brought us to where we are in order to get through it. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=915.9s)]
*  In a late development Friday evening, a federal judge permanently blocked President Trump's [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=921.94s)]
*  order against one of the law firms, saying that the order is unconstitutional. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=927.62s)]
*  No word yet on whether the administration will appeal. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=932.74s)]
*  Fertility rates in the United States are near historic lows. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=936.9s)]
*  One reason is a sharp decline over the last three decades in the number of American women [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=949.8199999999999s)]
*  having babies in their twenties. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=955.1999999999999s)]
*  And yet, there's been no change in women's biology or the age at which fertility declines. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=958.06s)]
*  Unsolvable problem? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=965.22s)]
*  Enter egg freezing. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=967.5400000000001s)]
*  Freezing embryos for in-vitro fertilization, IVF, has been possible for decades. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=970.14s)]
*  But freezing unfertilized eggs was a tougher scientific challenge, used initially for patients [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=976.74s)]
*  with cancer and other conditions that threatened fertility. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=984.02s)]
*  Egg freezing for non-medical reasons became an accepted practice 12 years ago. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=989.24s)]
*  And since then, demand has skyrocketed, with hundreds of thousands of eggs now frozen, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=995.6s)]
*  raising big money, big hopes, and big questions. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1002.6800000000001s)]
*  Could egg freezing offer women what previous generations only dreamed of? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1008.04s)]
*  The chance to put that dreaded ticking of the biological clock on ice. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1013.48s)]
*  Early one rainy Tuesday, Kate Sonderreger came to a fertility clinic in midtown Manhattan [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1022.36s)]
*  to undergo a minor surgical procedure to harvest and then freeze her eggs. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1028.8600000000001s)]
*  The next morning, hi. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1037.48s)]
*  At a different fertility center, we scrubbed up and met another egg freezing patient, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1039.98s)]

*  How are you feeling? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1046.96s)]
*  Excited. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1047.96s)]
*  Her doctor, Tomer Singer, head of Northwell Health's fertility practice, escorted her [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1048.96s)]
*  into the OR. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1055.6200000000001s)]

*  Egg retrieval is the culmination of an arduous process, nearly two weeks of daily self-administered [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1061.02s)]

*  The shots induce the ovaries to ripen multiple follicles, the sacs that contain eggs, so [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1072.4599999999998s)]

*  You can see the white end of the needle. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1084.34s)]
*  And drain the fluid in those follicles, which is then run into an adjacent embryology lab [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1086.8999999999999s)]

*  So the patient is right around the corner. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1095.3s)]
*  Correct. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1097.78s)]
*  We watched as a pair of embryologists did the delicate work of maneuvering tiny pipettes [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1098.78s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1116.94s)]
*  Those are the eggs. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1117.94s)]

*  Oh my goodness. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1119.94s)]
*  After a few hours, the eggs are put onto tiny special straws, then plunged into liquid [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1122.14s)]
*  nitrogen and stored in tanks at negative 320 degrees, where they will stay, possibly for [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1129.0600000000002s)]

*  According to the data thus far, as with IVF, there are no differences in the health of [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1152.98s)]
*  babies born from frozen eggs. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1157.86s)]
*  I think that egg freezing is as revolutionary as the pill was in the 1960s and 70s. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1160.74s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1168.46s)]
*  And that changed everything, as you know. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1169.46s)]
*  I know. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1170.46s)]
*  Women had the option of choosing who to be with and not to accidentally get pregnant [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1171.46s)]
*  with the wrong guy. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1175.58s)]
*  Egg freezing took it to an extra level. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1177.46s)]
*  So you don't have to have a baby at 30 because you're 30 or 35. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1179.86s)]
*  You can delay fertility into your 40s. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1184.02s)]
*  You'll have women having kids in their late 40s with their own eggs that were freezing [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1186.02s)]

*  Correct. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1200.9799999999998s)]

*  Why is it a good idea? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1221.5s)]
*  I 100% know that I really would love to have children. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1223.38s)]

*  kids because there definitely is that TikTok clock that started, and I'm not ready quite [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1239.18s)]
*  yet. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1245.82s)]

*  hasn't found the right partner. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1259.9s)]
*  It takes the stress away from dating. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1262.54s)]
*  You're not pressured to find someone and settle down and get married. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1264.78s)]

*  It ticks in every woman's head. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1274.78s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1277.8999999999999s)]
*  Like it or not, says Dr. Lucky Sikhan of Fertility Clinic RMA of New York, that damn clock is [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1280.18s)]
*  very real. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1288.02s)]
*  We're born with all of the eggs that we're ever going to have, and we don't make new [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1289.8s)]
*  eggs and we can't fix or repair them. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1292.6s)]
*  It's always decreasing over time. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1294.9199999999998s)]
*  So you're born with a number. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1296.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1298.84s)]
*  And it starts decreasing right away? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1299.84s)]
*  It pretty much starts decreasing even before you're born. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1302.12s)]
*  You're a fetus in your mother's womb at 20 weeks, and that's when you have the peak number [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1305.68s)]
*  of eggs, 6 to 7 million. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1310.3999999999999s)]
*  You have eggs at 20 weeks? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1311.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1313.3999999999999s)]
*  And then on, the number keeps going down, and the eggs keep aging. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1315.0s)]
*  So when you freeze an egg, you are stopping it from aging any further. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1320.2s)]
*  Correct. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1325.88s)]
*  So if you remove the egg and freeze it when you're 28, that egg is 28 years old. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1326.88s)]
*  Yep. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1332.88s)]
*  Until you thaw it. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1333.88s)]
*  Yes, it's incredible. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1334.88s)]
*  Because it's not just the quantity of women's eggs that decreases with age, it's also their [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1337.2s)]
*  quality, meaning their likelihood of becoming a baby. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1342.9s)]
*  Even at peak fertility, in women's 20s, some 25% of eggs, when combined with sperm, will [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1347.6200000000001s)]
*  create embryos that are chromosomally abnormal and will likely lead to miscarriages, and [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1355.1000000000001s)]
*  the percentages rise from there. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1361.8200000000002s)]
*  As you get to 35, that number has steadily increased to about 30 to 35% of embryos being [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1364.74s)]
*  abnormal from your 35-year-old eggs. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1370.86s)]
*  At 37, 38 years of age, 50%. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1373.34s)]
*  That's a turning point. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1377.1799999999998s)]
*  Things start to move more rapidly, and at 40, you're looking at 60 to 70% of embryos [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1378.1799999999998s)]
*  being abnormal. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1382.3s)]
*  By 45, 90%. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1383.3s)]
*  90%? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1385.5s)]
*  Correct. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1386.5s)]
*  A lot of times, people think that if they've done all the right things, if they've led [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1387.82s)]
*  a healthy lifestyle, they do yoga, they've never smoked a cigarette in their life, they [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1392.34s)]
*  They feel younger than their age, and they feel like their eggs will be younger than [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1396.98s)]
*  their age. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1400.9s)]
*  And I have to explain to them that we have no data to suggest that you can influence [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1401.9s)]
*  your egg quality in that way, unfortunately. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1407.1s)]
*  Is there an optimal age to freeze your eggs? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1410.08s)]
*  Yes, your 20s, because that's when you're at your lowest possible rate of genetic errors [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1414.02s)]
*  in the embryos that result from those eggs. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1420.66s)]

*  So that was a consideration? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1541.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1543.76s)]
*  As to where you worked? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1544.76s)]

*  made me more dedicated and committed to my company, actually. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1575.6s)]

*  Whoa. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1610.3999999999999s)]

*  And I was like, what should I do? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1614.88s)]
*  The doctor had mentioned egg freezing. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1617.1200000000001s)]
*  And I said, you know, this is kind of scary, but I decided to do it. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1620.44s)]
*  Paying out of pocket, she froze 10 eggs, which she considered her backup plan. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1625.8000000000002s)]

*  So Dr. Singer recommended thawing her 18 frozen eggs, fertilizing them with Paul's sperm, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1650.68s)]
*  and then doing genetic testing to assess viability. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1658.1200000000001s)]

*  Lindsay and Paul have four chromosomally normal embryos on ice waiting for them. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1671.72s)]

*  But then... [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1712.08s)]
*  Where's Christopher? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1713.08s)]

*  There's Christopher. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1715.08s)]
*  A second embryo from her frozen eggs did. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1717.32s)]

*  On the day that I started my egg freezing cycle, I screenshotted a quote that said, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1732.44s)]
*  do something today that your future self will thank you for. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1738.2s)]
*  That is something that I think about all the time because that really was the decision [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1743.2s)]
*  that changed my life. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1748.64s)]
*  But not every egg freezing story has such a happy ending. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1750.96s)]
*  It was just devastating. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1755.3200000000002s)]
*  It's really the worst thing that's ever happened to me by far. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1756.8000000000002s)]
*  They think they have an insurance policy that they don't have. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1760.92s)]
*  Does egg freezing promise young women more than it can deliver? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1765.6s)]
*  When we come back. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1770.9599999999998s)]
*  More and more American women are freezing their eggs to preserve their fertility. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1783.56s)]
*  The number of procedures has increased more than six times over, from 6,000 in 2014 to [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1789.32s)]

*  Investors have taken notice, seeing a market that could one day include a significant percentage [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1804.1599999999999s)]
*  of all young American women. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1810.8799999999999s)]
*  Enter capital and private equity firms have backed egg freezing startups and have bought [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1814.52s)]
*  up and invested in existing private and academic fertility clinics to consolidate them into [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1820.6s)]
*  giant networks. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1828.16s)]
*  But not everyone is convinced that egg freezing is such a gift to young women. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1830.6399999999999s)]
*  You're taking the financial cost, you're taking the medical cost for what? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1837.48s)]
*  For a gamble. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1842.0s)]

*  The women we've spoken to, they're almost giddy with this choice. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1852.28s)]
*  They say that they're freezing the biological clock. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1857.68s)]
*  That ticking thing is unbearable and it's gone. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1860.94s)]
*  I totally understand why young women are excited about it. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1866.16s)]
*  My fear when I hear young women say I froze the biological clock is that they think this [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1869.8s)]
*  is guaranteed. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1876.32s)]
*  They think I put a baby on ice, not my eggs, and I'm just going to go and thaw it when [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1877.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm ready to become a mother. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1883.96s)]
*  It's not that. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1886.5s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1887.5s)]
*  She points to stories like Evelyn Gosnell's. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1890.04s)]
*  Evelyn froze her eggs three times at ages 32, 36, and 38 for a total of 30 eggs, considered [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1893.56s)]
*  a very safe number. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1902.56s)]
*  Did you have some level of comfort? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1904.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1907.72s)]
*  Even my doctor was like, that's insane. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1908.86s)]
*  This is going to be a breeze, totally, no problem. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1912.36s)]
*  But when Evelyn and her now-fiance Edward went to use her 30 frozen eggs, only 19 survived [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1916.34s)]
*  the thaw, an unusually poor result. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1923.6s)]
*  Even worse, once those 19 eggs were fertilized, only one grew to be an embryo. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1927.32s)]
*  Anxiously hoping for positive results, they sent a few cells off for genetic testing to [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1935.24s)]
*  see if the embryo was viable. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1941.2s)]
*  So I was at work and got this message saying, we have your test results. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1944.08s)]
*  Before we give them to you, just confirming if you want to know the sex. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1949.48s)]
*  Boy, girl. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1952.4399999999998s)]
*  I just started to think, oh, wow, they've asked me if I want to know the sex. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1953.4399999999998s)]
*  It means that there's a real embryo there. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1958.04s)]
*  It means that this is real, it's normal, it's going to be fine. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1959.8s)]
*  It's all going to be good. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1962.36s)]
*  And then, boom, I get the report and I open it and it's abnormal and it was a girl. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1963.6799999999998s)]
*  There was no chance the embryo could become a baby. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1975.4799999999998s)]
*  Pregnancies like Evelyn's are heartbreaking. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1980.0s)]
*  And though rare, there have also been incidents where a storage tank has malfunctioned and [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1982.56s)]
*  thousands of eggs and embryos have been destroyed. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1988.36s)]
*  Dr. Lucky Seacon says she explains to all her patients that frozen eggs can never be [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1992.44s)]
*  a guarantee because just as in naturally occurring pregnancies, there is drop-off at every step [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=1999.76s)]
*  along the way. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2007.08s)]
*  She calls it an inverted pyramid. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2008.96s)]
*  You start out with this many eggs and then this many fertilize, this many turn into embryos, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2011.32s)]
*  this many embryos are actually genetically healthy and this many embryos actually implant. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2017.48s)]
*  You're taking a bet. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2022.54s)]
*  It's a gamble that you'll actually need these eggs, it's a gamble that it would work, and [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2024.2s)]
*  even if you manage to get pregnant, the older you are, the riskier it is to be pregnant. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2028.44s)]
*  So you're taking multiple risks, you're gambling on multiple stages. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2033.24s)]
*  But are you saying don't do it? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2038.08s)]
*  You know, Leslie, I'm not saying don't do it. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2041.84s)]
*  I'm saying it's probably a good option for some people, but I would like young women [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2044.52s)]
*  to really have options. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2050.96s)]

*  have children that they run out of time and it would be better if they could become mothers [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2061.2s)]
*  younger. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2066.7999999999997s)]
*  The optimal time from a biological medical perspective is in your 20s or early 30s, but [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2068.6s)]
*  the socially optimal time is later than that. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2075.36s)]
*  So I think we're telling women, oh, in your 20s, focus on your education, your career, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2079.68s)]
*  finding a partner, having financial stability, relationship stability, so that when you do [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2084.72s)]

*  That sounds pretty right to me. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2095.2s)]
*  What's wrong with that? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2098.3599999999997s)]
*  I think elective egg freezing sends women a message of, okay, don't worry, we have [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2099.64s)]
*  a solution for you. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2105.44s)]
*  Delay motherhood, it will cost you thousands of dollars. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2106.92s)]
*  It does involve medical risks. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2110.48s)]
*  There's a good chance it won't work at the end, and if it does work, your pregnancy [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2113.2s)]
*  will be riskier for you and for your baby, but that's okay. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2116.3999999999996s)]
*  We have a solution. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2119.52s)]
*  A better solution, she argues, would be to have policies like paid parental leave, flexible [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2121.48s)]
*  hours, child care at the workplace to make it easier for women to have babies younger. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2128.12s)]
*  Who's dating? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2134.8s)]
*  But these women told us they weren't ready to have children younger. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2136.88s)]
*  Still active and trying to find the right person. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2141.7200000000003s)]
*  And say they understand there's never certainty. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2144.96s)]
*  How do they explain that it's not a guarantee? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2148.84s)]
*  They said exactly those words. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2152.36s)]
*  It is not a guarantee. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2154.4s)]
*  So what are the chances of success if you freeze your eggs? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2157.1600000000003s)]
*  A 2022 study from one large fertility center found that 70% of women who froze at least [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2161.52s)]
*  20 eggs before the age of 38 had a baby. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2169.08s)]
*  But success rates dropped off considerably the older women were and the fewer eggs they [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2173.56s)]
*  froze. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2179.88s)]
*  Which means that many women like Carissa and Namitha do more than one round of egg freezing [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2181.72s)]
*  to bank more eggs. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2188.6s)]
*  And that brings us back to the money. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2190.64s)]
*  Business is booming in the field of fertility, and egg freezing is a big part of it. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2193.24s)]
*  These target women with catchy ads on social media, host fun events like fitness classes, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2199.6s)]
*  even a manicure to give women information and draw them in. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2206.84s)]
*  What I've seen is a transition in my own field. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2211.8s)]
*  Dr. Marcel Cedars, a fertility specialist with the University of California San Francisco [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2215.72s)]
*  and a past president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, says getting women [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2221.96s)]
*  information is great, but she worries that the emphasis on profits she's seeing in private [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2228.0s)]
*  equity-backed fertility companies is creating warped incentives. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2234.6s)]
*  Have you heard in any companies that are owned by large firms that the doctors are being [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2240.12s)]
*  pressured to encourage more cycles, encourage things that will lead to more revenue? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2246.6800000000003s)]
*  I would hope it's not universal, but that is definitely occurring in some companies. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2254.2s)]
*  How quickly do you get someone? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2259.8399999999997s)]
*  How many cycles do you get per patient? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2261.8399999999997s)]
*  That's how revenue is based. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2264.7599999999998s)]
*  That's how payment and compensation is based. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2266.52s)]
*  And so that's what the motivation becomes. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2269.3199999999997s)]
*  It becomes much more a business. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2272.12s)]
*  It does. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2275.08s)]
*  I mean, I have always bristled when I hear my specialty called an industry. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2276.08s)]
*  And I think in the past it wasn't, but I do think it is becoming that. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2281.36s)]
*  And it is painful to me. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2289.2400000000002s)]
*  Pink number 14. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2293.36s)]

*  for large companies can't afford egg freezing. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2300.92s)]
*  Vardit Ravitsky agrees. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2305.04s)]
*  The majority of women who freeze their eggs electively are white and well-resourced. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2307.32s)]
*  And there's a significant gap in your options and your reproductive autonomy if you have [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2313.88s)]
*  resources or you don't. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2319.92s)]
*  Everyone cannot do this. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2322.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2323.96s)]
*  Poor women. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2324.96s)]

*  We don't yet know how to properly drive down the cost. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2329.8s)]
*  It's a very expensive endeavor. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2333.76s)]
*  If this is being done just for someone's peace of mind, should they go through this? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2336.22s)]
*  I think it depends on their age and attitude towards family building. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2343.3399999999997s)]
*  If someone says to me, I'm 35, I know I want children, then yes, I think they should absolutely [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2348.58s)]
*  do this. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2354.1s)]
*  Especially if they say I want to have more than one child because they might be ready [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2355.1s)]
*  at 37, 38 and have no trouble at all. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2360.3399999999997s)]

*  Speaking of baby number two, Tina gave birth to a second little boy, Christopher's baby [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2366.98s)]

*  Do you think that one day virtually every young woman will do this as it would be routine? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2388.1s)]
*  I really do think so. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2394.7400000000002s)]
*  Once it's going to be affordable, covered by insurance, I'm a big believer that egg [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2396.7400000000002s)]
*  freezing and IVF is going to be the way our next generation will expand. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2401.06s)]
*  I think that having timed intercourse or unprotected intercourse for reproduction is going to be [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2406.9s)]
*  falling out of favor in the next generation or so. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2411.7000000000003s)]

*  I said that sex is going to be for fun and for pleasure, but most likely in the generation [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2418.26s)]
*  from now when couples want to have kids, most likely they're going to be using artificial [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2423.96s)]
*  reproductive technique. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2428.36s)]
*  You'll have frozen eggs. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2429.36s)]
*  Wait, are you saying that we won't have sex to have children? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2430.88s)]
*  I'm sure my two-year-old will ask me, Mom, Dad, you had unprotected intercourse? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2434.96s)]

*  Should gynecologists talk about this when you go in and you're young? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2468.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYyB5bSl8Y&t=2473.86s)]
