# Futuristic Weapons, Threats and Security | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE)
*  By now, we've all heard about Elon Musk's efforts to reshape the U.S. government. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=0.0s)]
*  But tonight, we'll introduce you to another tech billionaire, one who set his sights on [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  radically changing the way the Pentagon buys and uses weapons. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=23.48s)]
*  His name is Palmer Luckey, and he's the founder of Andrel, a California defense products company. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=28.2s)]
*  Luckey says for too long, the U.S. military has relied on overpriced and outdated technology. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=34.64s)]
*  He argues a Tesla has better AI than any U.S. aircraft, and a Roomba vacuum has better autonomy [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=40.92s)]
*  than most of the Pentagon's weapons systems. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=47.76s)]
*  So Andrel is making a line of autonomous weapons that operate using artificial intelligence, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=50.76s)]
*  no human required. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=56.96s)]
*  Some international groups have called those types of weapons killer robots. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=58.92s)]
*  But Palmer Luckey says it is the future of warfare. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=63.28s)]
*  I've always said that we need to transition from being the world police to being the world gun store. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=67.88s)]
*  Do we want to be the world's gun store? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=73.52s)]
*  I think so. I think we have to. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=74.84s)]
*  Says the guy who sells weapons. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=76.32s)]
*  See, I agree it sounds self-fulfilling, but you have to remember I also got into this [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=78.36s)]
*  industry because I believe that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=82.6s)]
*  Palmer Luckey isn't your typical defense industry executive. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=84.76s)]
*  His daily uniform, flip-flops and a Hawaiian shirt, is more suited for Margaritaville than [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=89.12s)]
*  the military. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  But the 32-year-old billionaire is the founder of Andrel, whose line of American-made autonomous [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  weapons looks like it came straight out of a sci-fi movie, and whose slick marketing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=102.02000000000001s)]
*  videos wouldn't be out of place in one. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=107.48s)]
*  Here's the Road Runner, a twin turbo jet-powered drone interceptor that can take off, identify [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=111.52s)]
*  and strike. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=118.56s)]
*  If it doesn't find a target, it can land and try again. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=119.56s)]
*  Andrel also makes headsets, which allow soldiers to see 360 degrees in combat. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=127.28s)]
*  And there's this. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=133.32s)]
*  It's an electromagnetic warfare system that can be programmed to jam enemy systems, knocking [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=134.76s)]
*  out drone swarms. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=141.06s)]
*  It's not some futuristic fantasy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=143.12s)]
*  Andrel's systems are already being used by the U.S. military and in the war in Ukraine. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=145.62s)]
*  We shouldn't be sending our people to stand in other countries, putting our men and women, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=151.18s)]
*  our sons and daughters, at risk for the sovereignty of other nations. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=156.88s)]
*  You'd rather have an American-made product in their hands than our soldiers over there. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=161.5s)]
*  Absolutely, every time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=166.06s)]
*  And I think that that's one of the reasons that autonomy is so powerful. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=167.06s)]
*  Right now, there's so many weapon systems that require manning. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=170.28s)]
*  If I can have one guy commanding and controlling 100 aircraft, that's a lot easier than having [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=172.8s)]
*  to have a pilot in every single one, and it puts a lot fewer American lives at risk. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=179.2s)]
*  To be clear, autonomy does not mean remote control. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=185.4s)]
*  Once an autonomous weapon is programmed and given a task, it can use artificial intelligence [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=189.44s)]
*  for surveillance or to identify, select and engage targets. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=195.39999999999998s)]
*  No operator needed. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=203.17999999999998s)]
*  It's a scary idea to some people. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=207.42s)]
*  It's a scary idea, but that's the world we live in. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  I'd say it's a lot scarier, for example, to imagine a weapon system that doesn't have [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  any level of intelligence at all. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=215.76s)]
*  There's no moral high ground in making a landmine that can't tell the difference between a school [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=217.84s)]
*  bus full of children and Russian armor. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=220.62s)]
*  It's not a question between smart weapons and no weapons. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=222.4s)]
*  It's a question between smart weapons and dumb weapons. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=225.28s)]
*  Lucky showed us how those so-called smart weapons can be synchronized on Andrew's AI [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=228.02s)]
*  platform. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  It's called Lattice. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=234.6s)]
*  Lattice collects data from various sensors and sources, including satellites, drones, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  radar and cameras, allowing, he says, the AI to analyze move assets and execute missions [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=241.8s)]
*  faster than a human. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=250.1s)]
*  If you were having to require the human operator to actually map every single action and say, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=252.0s)]
*  hey, do this, if that, then this, it would take so long to manage it that you would be [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=257.52s)]
*  better off just remotely piloting it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=261.44s)]
*  It's the AI on board all these weapons that makes it possible to make it so easy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=263.6s)]
*  There are lots of people who go, oh, AI, I don't know. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=268.56s)]
*  I don't trust it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=270.76s)]
*  It's going to go rogue. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=271.8s)]
*  I would say that it is something to be aware of, but in the grand scheme of things, things [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=273.34s)]
*  to be afraid of, there's things that I'm much more terrified of. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=279.32s)]
*  And I'm a lot more worried about evil people with mediocre advances in technology than [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  AI deciding that it's going to wipe us all out. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=288.24s)]
*  Lucky says all Andrew's weapons have a kill switch that allow a human operator to intervene [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=290.76s)]
*  if needed. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=296.24s)]
*  But the secretary general of the United Nations has called lethal autonomous weapons, quote, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=297.24s)]
*  politically unacceptable and morally repugnant. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=302.96s)]
*  When people say to you, look, it's evil, how do you respond to that? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=306.48s)]
*  I usually don't bother because if I am going to argue with them, I usually poke it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=312.12s)]
*  I'm like, OK, so do you think that NATO should be armed with squirt guns or slingshots? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  How about sternly worded letters? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=321.32s)]
*  Would you like that? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=323.20000000000005s)]
*  Would you like it if NATO just, they just have a bunch of guys sitting at typewriters, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=324.20000000000005s)]
*  a thousand monkeys writing letters to Vladimir Putin, begging him to not invade Ukraine? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=327.64000000000004s)]
*  Our entire society exists because of a credible backstop of violence threatened by the United [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=332.28s)]
*  States and our allies all over the world. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=337.64s)]
*  And thank goodness for it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=339.76s)]
*  It might sound flip, but part of Paul Merlucky's philosophy is that autonomous weapons ultimately [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=341.52s)]
*  promote peace by scaring adversaries away. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=347.67999999999995s)]
*  My position has been that the United States needs to arm our allies and partners around [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=351.55999999999995s)]
*  the world so that they can be prickly porcupines that nobody wants to step on. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=357.52s)]
*  Nobody wants to bite them. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=362.06s)]
*  In your mind, is it enough just to have all these things as deterrents or do they have [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=364.18s)]
*  to be deployed and used? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=369.04s)]
*  They have to believe that you can use them. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=370.88s)]
*  By the end of this year, Andrews says it will have secured more than six billion dollars [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=373.22s)]
*  in government contracts worldwide. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=377.86s)]
*  When you first came into this space and you're a tech guy in a Hawaiian shirt and you're [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=380.62s)]
*  walking into the Pentagon, maybe in flip flops, I don't know, were you welcomed with open [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=385.74s)]
*  arms? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=391.78s)]
*  There were a very small number of people who welcomed me with open arms and everyone else [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=392.78s)]
*  thought that I was nuts. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  Nuts because there hasn't been a new company in the defense industry in a significant way [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=397.9s)]
*  since the end of the Cold War. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=402.82s)]
*  For decades, five defense contractors called the Primes have dominated the industry. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=404.94s)]
*  Typically, the Primes present an idea to the Pentagon. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=410.53999999999996s)]
*  If the Pentagon buys it, the government pays for the company to develop it, even if it's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=414.38s)]
*  late or goes over budget. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=419.34s)]
*  Lucky started Andrel to flip that procurement structure on its head. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=422.02s)]
*  The idea behind Andrel was to build not a defense contractor, but a defense product [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=426.17999999999995s)]
*  company. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=432.5s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=433.5s)]
*  Contractors in general are paid to do work, whether or not it succeeds. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=435.26s)]
*  A product company has a very different mentality. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=439.29999999999995s)]
*  You're putting in your own money. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=441.78s)]
*  You're putting in your own time. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=443.26s)]
*  My vision was to build a company that would show up not with a PowerPoint describing how [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=444.72s)]
*  taxpayers are going to pay all my bills, but with a working product where all the risk [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=449.74s)]
*  has been baked out. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  It will work for enough things that you can save our country hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  a year. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=459.72s)]
*  It may not surprise you that Palmer Lucky's father was a car salesman. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=460.72s)]
*  His mother took on the role of homeschooling him and his three sisters. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=464.76000000000005s)]
*  Lucky says he was fascinated by electronics and spent a lot of time tinkering in his parents' [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=469.36s)]

*  And at 21, Palmer Lucky fulfilled every young founder's dream when he sold Oculus to Facebook [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=483.24s)]

*  Why did you get fired? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=498.16s)]
*  Well, you know, everyone's got a different story, but it boils down to I gave $9,000 [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=499.16s)]
*  to a political group that was for Donald Trump and against Hillary Clinton. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=504.4s)]
*  To be a Trump supporter in 2016, you know, this was at the height of the election insanity [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=509.2s)]
*  and derangement in Silicon Valley. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=515.12s)]
*  And so I think that a lot of people thought back then that you could, you could just fire [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=517.28s)]
*  a Trump supporter. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=522.16s)]
*  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has denied that Lucky was fired for his political views. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=523.16s)]
*  What do you think now when you see those tech leaders, Mark Zuckerberg, lined up behind [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=528.9s)]
*  President Trump now at his inauguration? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=533.08s)]
*  I am inclined to let every single one of them get away with it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=535.32s)]
*  Look. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=538.44s)]
*  What do you mean get away with it? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=539.44s)]
*  Coming around to a point of view that is more aligned with the American people broadly, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=541.08s)]
*  I think is good for the country. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=545.5600000000001s)]
*  I think it is not good for you to have techno corpo elites that are radically out of step [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=546.8000000000001s)]

*  I was fired at the height of my career. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=562.92s)]
*  My gears were ground and I really wanted to prove that I was somebody, that I was not [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=567.28s)]
*  a one hit wonder and that I still had it in me to do big things. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=571.4s)]
*  He says he thought about starting companies to combat obesity or fix the prison system, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=576.16s)]

*  Have you run into any people who don't take you seriously because you were never in the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=584.8s)]
*  military? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=588.8s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=590.76s)]
*  I think I owe that to the James Bond franchise. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=592.32s)]
*  Everyone in the military has seen James Bond movies and they all like you. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=596.32s)]
*  I'm the wacky gadget man. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=601.84s)]
*  I'm the guy who types on the computer and pushes up my glasses and then gives them a [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=603.6s)]
*  strange thing to help them accomplish their mission. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=607.2800000000001s)]
*  And this is his laboratory, Andrew's 640,000 square foot headquarters in Costa Mesa, California. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=609.9200000000001s)]
*  It's a mix of high tech carpentry and robotic engineering. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=618.24s)]
*  A sign on the floor pokes fun at the boss' shoe choice. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=622.44s)]
*  But Lucky wanted to show us something off campus. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=626.88s)]
*  We hopped in his 1985 Humvee. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=629.94s)]
*  The billionaire told us he also owns a decommissioned Blackhawk helicopter, a 48-cruise submarine [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=634.64s)]
*  and a Navy speedboat. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=641.28s)]
*  In Dana Point, we took a ride 15 minutes off the coast to see the largest weapon in [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=644.18s)]
*  Andrew's arsenal, this submarine. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=649.0999999999999s)]
*  It's called the Dive XL. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=652.02s)]
*  It's about the size of a school bus and works autonomously. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=654.42s)]
*  It's not remote controlled by this computer. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=657.5799999999999s)]
*  It's doing it on the brain, on the submarine itself. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=660.9799999999999s)]
*  So if I told it to go off and perform some mission, months long, like go to this target, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=663.9799999999999s)]
*  listen for this particular signature, and if you see this signature run, if you see [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=668.54s)]
*  this one, that was a hide, if you see this one, follow it, it can do that all on its [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=672.46s)]
*  own without being detected, without communicating with it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=676.98s)]
*  Andrew says the Dive XL can travel a thousand miles fully submerged. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=680.9s)]
*  Australia has already invested $58 million in the subs to help defend its seas from China. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=685.9s)]
*  But Andrew's most anticipated weapon has been closely guarded until this month. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=694.18s)]
*  Hidden inside this hangar, Andrew's unmanned fighter jet called Fury. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=700.06s)]
*  There is no cockpit or stick or rudder because there's no pilot. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=707.02s)]
*  The idea is that you're building a robotic fighter jet that is flying with manned fighters [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=712.02s)]
*  and is doing what you ask it to do, recommending things that be done, taking risks that you [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=717.8199999999999s)]
*  don't want human pilots to take. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=722.66s)]
*  Fury represents a big turning point for the company. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=724.78s)]
*  Andrew was viewed by some inside the defense industry as a tech-bro startup until it beat [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=728.54s)]
*  out several of the prime defense contractors to make an unmanned fighter jet for the Air [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=733.78s)]
*  Force. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=739.02s)]
*  Fury is scheduled to take its first test flight this summer. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=740.02s)]
*  If selected by the Pentagon, it, like all Andrew products, will be produced in the U.S. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=744.12s)]
*  The war games say we're going to run out of munitions in eight days in a fight with China. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=750.58s)]
*  If we have to fight Iran and China and Russia all at the same time, we are screwed. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=754.14s)]
*  If we go to war, right? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=757.98s)]
*  Your version of what Andrew's place is in a conflict. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=759.58s)]
*  How do you view it? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=765.14s)]
*  I think what we're going to be doing is first connecting a lot of these systems that otherwise [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=766.34s)]
*  would not have been talking to one another. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=770.7800000000001s)]
*  We're going to be making large numbers of cruise missiles, large numbers of fighter [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=772.38s)]
*  jets, large numbers of surface and subsurface systems. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=776.0600000000001s)]
*  I guess I would hope that Andrew is making most of the stuff that's being used on day [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=779.46s)]
*  9, day 10, day 11, day 100. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=783.5400000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of that is going to be coming out of our factories after everything else [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=786.18s)]
*  is run dry. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=790.18s)]
*  In the past year, hospitals, pharmacies, tech companies, Las Vegas' biggest hotels and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=800.02s)]
*  casinos have been paralyzed by ransomware attacks, in which hackers break into a corporate [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=805.78s)]

*  As we first reported in April, it's a crime that has been growing more costly and disruptive [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=818.9399999999999s)]
*  every year. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=824.52s)]
*  Now cybersecurity researchers fear it's about to get worse. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=826.18s)]
*  With the emergence of an audacious group of young criminal hackers from the U.S., U.K., [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=830.8199999999999s)]

*  More troubling, they've teamed up with Russia's most notorious ransomware gang. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=840.1s)]
*  Last September, one of the most pernicious ransomware attacks in history was unleashed [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=850.1s)]

*  It disrupted operations at a dozen of the most renowned gaming palaces on the Las Vegas [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=863.14s)]
*  strip, MGM Grand, Aria, Mandalay Bay, New York, New York, the Bellagio. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=868.06s)]
*  Anthony Curtis is a Las Vegas fixture. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=878.42s)]
*  He's so good at counting cards, he's been banned from card games here. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=881.38s)]

*  Incredibly, when it happened, I was in an MGM property. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=892.9399999999999s)]
*  And it happened while we were having dinner and there just began to be a rumbling that [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=896.42s)]
*  something was going on. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=900.0999999999999s)]
*  When I went down into the casino, I could see then that slot machines were sitting dark, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=901.68s)]
*  people were scrambling around. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=906.6999999999999s)]
*  The shutdown was starting to take effect. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=908.12s)]

*  So all of a sudden now people are going, how do I get my money? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=916.3s)]
*  What's wrong? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=918.4599999999999s)]
*  And the people were sitting there waiting and couldn't get paid. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=919.4599999999999s)]

*  They were getting angry, yeah. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=923.3399999999999s)]
*  And this was just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=924.94s)]
*  Elevators were malfunctioning. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=928.0600000000001s)]
*  Parking gates froze. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=929.9000000000001s)]
*  Digital door keys wouldn't work. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=931.86s)]
*  As computers went down, reservations locked up and lines backed up at the front desks. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=934.22s)]
*  Anything that required technology was not working. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=940.46s)]

*  Nobody knew what to do. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=945.58s)]
*  And including the employees. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=946.58s)]
*  The employees just had to beg forgiveness and patience. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=947.58s)]
*  It's corporate terrorism at its finest. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=952.38s)]
*  The company declined our interview request, but at a conference a month after the hack, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=955.34s)]
*  MGM's CEO admitted the disruptions were devastating. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=960.82s)]
*  For the next four or five days, with 36,000 hotel rooms and some regional properties, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=965.9000000000001s)]

*  $100 million in lost revenue and millions more to rebuild their servers. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=982.42s)]
*  So how did the intruders get in? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=989.12s)]
*  Through a technique of deception and manipulation called social engineering. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=992.04s)]
*  First, hackers zeroed in on an employee, gathering information from the dark web and open sources [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=996.42s)]

*  around the same time, suspected by the same group. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1058.38s)]

*  hackers responsible for the casino hacks and dozens more. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1132.58s)]
*  Their specialty is social engineering. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1137.22s)]
*  Part of their success is because they are fluent in Western culture. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1140.34s)]

*  How are they connected? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1210.08s)]

*  ransomware attacks, including the 2021 attack on Colonial Pipeline, which caused gas shortages [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1332.64s)]

*  So there's a term, it's called ransomware as a service, that's been given to the structure [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1371.44s)]

*  DiMaggio says the Russian government provides a safe haven for ransomware gangs. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1435.72s)]
*  As long as they don't target an organization that falls within Russia or the former Soviet [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1441.8s)]
*  state, they don't get prosecuted. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1448.52s)]
*  It's not considered a crime. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1451.0s)]
*  It's not considered a crime to attack American businesses? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1452.48s)]
*  It's crazy, right? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1456.32s)]
*  That's how it works though. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1458.0s)]
*  So it's like they operate with impunity. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1459.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1460.96s)]
*  That's the whole reason why this is such a popular crime. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1461.96s)]
*  Russian ransomware has become such a threat, the elite cyber warriors at the National Security [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1466.28s)]
*  Agency have joined the fight. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1471.96s)]
*  Before retiring last March, Rob Joyce was NSA's director of cybersecurity. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1474.68s)]
*  He told us the colonial pipeline attack was a wake-up call. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1480.3200000000002s)]
*  It caused us to step back and decide that we had to put more resources into this foreign [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1484.8000000000002s)]
*  threat. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1490.48s)]
*  So one of the things NSA has, we have hackers and it really at times takes a hacker to defeat [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1491.48s)]
*  a hacker. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1497.6s)]
*  That's the value NSA can bring is we can identify people, specific people involved in some of [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1498.76s)]
*  these activities. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1504.72s)]
*  The NSA helped identify the Russian hacker responsible for the colonial pipeline attack. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1505.72s)]
*  And in January 2022, after months of negotiations, Russia arrested him and other accomplices. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1514.48s)]
*  But five weeks later, it all came undone. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1522.84s)]
*  Following the Ukraine invasion, those people were let out of jail. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1526.96s)]
*  So they're back in business? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1530.52s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1531.8s)]
*  And now they've teamed up with the young native English speakers of Scattered Spider. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1533.0s)]
*  The FBI's Brian Vorndrin calls it an evolution of cybercrime. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1538.56s)]
*  In the case of Scattered Spider, is it powerful that they are with Black Hat? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1543.52s)]
*  Of course. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1548.66s)]

*  In the past few years, facial recognition technology has become a critical tool for [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1613.0600000000002s)]
*  law enforcement. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1617.5s)]

*  We thought it was maybe a mistaken identity. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1696.72s)]
*  Like, did someone use his name? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1698.92s)]
*  He was brought to this detention center and locked in a cell overnight. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1701.3200000000002s)]
*  Police believed Williams was this man in the red hat recorded in a Detroit store in 2018, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1705.44s)]
*  stealing $3,800 worth of watches. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1711.8s)]
*  When Detroit detectives finally questioned Williams more than 12 hours after his arrest, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1714.96s)]
*  they showed him some photos, including from the store security camera. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1719.64s)]
*  So he turns over the paper and he's like, so that's not you? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1723.64s)]
*  And I looked at it, picked it up and held it up to my face and I said, I hope y'all [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1728.52s)]
*  don't think all black people look alike. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1733.52s)]

*  Like, bro, why am I even here? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1736.8s)]
*  He's like, so I guess the computer got it wrong. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1739.76s)]
*  The police officer said the computer got it wrong. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1741.88s)]
*  Yeah, the computer got it wrong. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1744.32s)]
*  Williams didn't know the computer they were referring to was a facial recognition program. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1746.76s)]
*  Detroit police showed us how their system works. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1752.1200000000001s)]
*  First, a photo of an unknown suspect is run against a database of hundreds of thousands [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1755.44s)]
*  of mug shots, which we blurred for this demonstration. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1760.52s)]
*  It's an electronic mug book, if you will. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1763.8s)]
*  James Craig has been Detroit's chief of police since 2013. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1766.0s)]
*  Once we insert a photograph, a probe photo into the software, the computer may generate [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1770.0s)]
*  100 probables and then they rank these photographs in order of what the computer suggests or [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1777.96s)]
*  the software suggests is the most likely suspect. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1785.48s)]
*  The software ranks it in order of most likely suspect to lose. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1788.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1792.44s)]
*  It's then up to an analyst to compare each of those possible matches to the suspect and [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1793.44s)]
*  decide whether any of them should be investigated further. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1798.44s)]
*  In the Robert Williams case, Detroit police say they didn't have an analyst on duty that [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1802.0s)]
*  day. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1806.3600000000001s)]
*  So they asked Michigan State Police to run this photo through their system, which had [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1807.3600000000001s)]
*  a database of nearly 50 million faces taken from mug shots, but also state IDs and drivers [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1811.8s)]
*  licenses. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1818.28s)]
*  This old driver's license photo of Robert Williams popped up. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1819.64s)]
*  We learned it was ranked ninth among 243 possible matches. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1823.16s)]
*  An analyst then sent it to Detroit police as an investigative lead only, not probable [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1827.8s)]
*  cause to arrest. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1833.28s)]
*  What happened in the case of Robert Williams? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1835.0s)]
*  What went wrong? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1837.6200000000001s)]
*  Sloppy, sloppy investigative work. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1839.0s)]
*  Sloppy, Chief Craig says, because the detective in Detroit did little other investigative [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1843.52s)]
*  work before getting a warrant to arrest Williams. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1848.6s)]
*  The response by this administration, that detective was disciplined and subsequently [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1852.04s)]
*  a commanding officer of that command has been de-appointed. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1857.3600000000001s)]
*  But it wasn't facial recognition that failed. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1860.84s)]
*  What failed was a horrible investigation. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1863.96s)]
*  Two weeks after he was arrested, the charges against Robert Williams were dismissed. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1868.84s)]
*  The police in Detroit say that the Williams case was in large part a result of sloppy [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1873.72s)]
*  detective work. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1878.12s)]
*  Do you think that's true? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1879.12s)]
*  That's part of the story, for sure. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1880.1999999999998s)]
*  But face recognition is also part of the story. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1881.9199999999998s)]
*  Claire Garvey, a lawyer at Georgetown's Center on Privacy and Technology, estimates facial [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1884.36s)]
*  recognition has been involved in hundreds of thousands of cases. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1889.32s)]
*  She's been tracking its use by police for years. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1893.56s)]
*  Legislators, law enforcement and software developers have all sought out Garvey's input [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1896.76s)]
*  on the topic. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1901.24s)]
*  Because it's a machine, because it's math that does the face recognition match in these [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1902.6399999999999s)]
*  systems, we're giving it too much credence. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1908.12s)]
*  We're saying it's math, therefore it must be right. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1912.24s)]
*  The computer must be right. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1915.1999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1916.76s)]
*  When we want to agree with the computer, we're going to go find evidence that agrees with it. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1917.76s)]
*  But Garvey says the computer is only as good as the software it runs on. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1922.6s)]
*  There are some good algorithms, there are some terrible algorithms, and everything in [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1927.1999999999998s)]
*  between. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1930.56s)]
*  Patrick Groether has examined most of them. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1931.8s)]
*  He's a computer scientist at a little-known government agency called the National Institute [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1934.28s)]
*  of Standards and Technology. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1938.9599999999998s)]
*  Every year, more than a hundred facial recognition developers around the world send his lab prototypes [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1940.9199999999998s)]
*  to test for accuracy. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1948.24s)]
*  Are computers good at recognizing faces? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1949.9599999999998s)]
*  They're very good. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1952.4s)]
*  They're better than humans today. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1953.4s)]
*  Are these algorithms flawless? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1955.48s)]
*  By no means. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1957.1200000000001s)]
*  Software developers train facial recognition algorithms by showing them huge numbers of [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1958.92s)]
*  human faces so they can learn how to spot similarities and differences. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1963.1200000000001s)]
*  But they don't work the way you might expect. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1968.0s)]
*  We've all seen in movies computers that form a map of the face. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1970.5600000000002s)]
*  Is that what's happening with facial recognition? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1973.8000000000002s)]
*  I mean, historically, yes. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1975.88s)]
*  But nowadays, that is not the approach. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1977.48s)]
*  So it's not taking your nose and comparing it to noses in its database, or then taking [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1980.26s)]
*  eyes and comparing it to eyes? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1987.48s)]
*  Nothing so explicit. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1989.3799999999999s)]
*  It could be looking at eyebrows or eyes or nose or lips. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1990.86s)]
*  It could be looking at skin texture. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1995.78s)]
*  So we have 20 photos of Anderson Cooper. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=1998.46s)]
*  What is consistent? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2001.82s)]

*  In a criminal justice context, it could lead to an incorrect arrest. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2025.22s)]
*  Why would race or gender of a person lead to misidentification? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2028.98s)]
*  The algorithm has been built on a finite number of photos that may or may not be demographically [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2035.98s)]
*  balanced. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2040.98s)]
*  Might not have enough females, enough Asian people, enough black people among the photos [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2041.98s)]
*  that it's using to teach the algorithm. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2046.42s)]
*  Yeah, to teach the algorithm how to do identity. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2048.66s)]
*  Claire Garvey points out the potential for mistakes makes it all the more important how [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2054.1s)]
*  police use the information generated by the software. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2058.64s)]
*  Is facial recognition being misused by police? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2062.64s)]
*  In the absence of rules, what's misuse? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2065.58s)]
*  There are very few rules in most places around how the technology is used. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2068.5s)]
*  It turns out there aren't well established national guidelines and it's up to states, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2072.8199999999997s)]
*  cities, and local law enforcement agencies to decide how they use the technology. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2077.54s)]
*  Who can run facial recognition searches? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2083.1s)]
*  What kind of formal training, if any, is needed and what kind of images can be used in a search? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2085.7s)]
*  In a 2019 report, Garvey found surprising practices at some police departments, including [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2091.38s)]
*  the editing of suspects' facial features before running the photos in a search. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2097.06s)]
*  Most photos that police are dealing with understandably are partially obscured. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2102.58s)]
*  Police departments say no worries, just cut and paste someone else's features, someone [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2107.42s)]
*  else's chin and mouth into that photo before submitting it. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2112.7400000000002s)]
*  But that's like half of somebody's face. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2117.1800000000003s)]
*  I agree. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2119.9s)]
*  If we think about this, face recognition is considered a biometric, like fingerprinting. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2121.02s)]
*  It's unique to the individual. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2124.94s)]
*  So how can you swap out people's eyes and expect to still get a good result? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2126.58s)]
*  Detroit's police chief, James Craig, says they don't allow that kind of editing with [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2132.5s)]
*  their facial recognition system, which cost an estimated $1.8 million and has been in [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2135.98s)]
*  use since 2017. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2141.62s)]
*  He says it's become a crucial tool in combating one of the highest violent crime rates in [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2144.14s)]
*  the country and was used in 117 investigations last year alone. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2150.02s)]
*  We understand that the software is not perfect. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2154.14s)]
*  We know that. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2159.18s)]
*  It's got to be tempting for some officers to use it as more than just a lead. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2160.18s)]
*  Well, as I like to always say to my staff, the end never justifies the means. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2165.38s)]
*  After Robert Williams, another alleged wrongful arrest by Detroit police came to light. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2172.14s)]
*  Chief Craig says they put in place stricter policies limiting the use of facial recognition [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2178.02s)]
*  to violent crime. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2182.86s)]
*  Let your code of ethics and integrity guide you. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2184.58s)]
*  Requiring police to disclose its use to prosecutors when seeking a warrant and adding new layers [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2187.58s)]
*  of oversight. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2193.42s)]
*  So analyst number one will go through the methodical work of trying to identify the [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2194.8s)]
*  suspect. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2201.58s)]
*  A second analyst has to go through the same level of rigor. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2202.58s)]
*  The last step is if the supervisor concurs, now that person can be used as a lead, a lead [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2206.64s)]
*  only. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2213.72s)]
*  A suspect cannot be arrested alone and charged alone based on the recognition. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2214.72s)]
*  But there are police departments like this one in Woodbridge, New Jersey, where it's [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2221.8399999999997s)]
*  unclear what rules are in place. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2225.68s)]
*  In February 2019, police in Woodbridge arrested 33-year-old Najir Parks. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2228.7599999999998s)]
*  Did they tell you why they thought it was you? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2234.46s)]
*  Pretty much just facial recognition. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2237.5s)]
*  When I asked them, like, well, how did you come to get me? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2238.9s)]
*  Like the computer brought you up, the computer's not just going to lie? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2241.62s)]
*  Police said a suspect allegedly shoplifted from this Hampton Inn and nearly hit an officer [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2245.3s)]
*  with a car while escaping the scene. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2250.14s)]
*  They ran this driver's license the suspect gave them through a facial recognition program. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2252.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not clear if this is the perpetrator since law enforcement said it's a fake ID. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2258.12s)]
*  According to police reports, the search returned, quote, a high-profile comparison to Najir [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2263.46s)]
*  Parks. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2268.9s)]
*  He spent more than a week in jail before he was released to fight his case in court. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2269.9s)]
*  I think they looked at my background and they pretty much figured like he had the jacket, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2275.02s)]
*  we got him, he ain't, he's not going to fight it. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2278.14s)]
*  What do you say, he had a jacket? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2279.7400000000002s)]
*  You had prior convictions? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2281.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2282.48s)]
*  What prior convictions did you have? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2283.48s)]
*  I've been convicted for selling drugs. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2284.78s)]
*  I've been in prison twice for it. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2286.7s)]
*  But I've been home since 2016. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2288.14s)]
*  I had a job, now I'm stuck the whole time. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2289.86s)]
*  Facing 20 years in jail, Parks says he considered taking a plea deal. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2293.8999999999996s)]
*  I knew I didn't do it, but it's like I got a chance to be home spending more time with [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2298.22s)]
*  my son or I got a chance to come home and he's a grown man and might have his own son. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2302.62s)]
*  Because I think most people think, well, if I didn't commit a crime, there's no way I [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2305.74s)]
*  would accept a plea deal. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2309.3799999999997s)]
*  You would say that until you're sitting right there. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2311.02s)]
*  After eight months, prosecutors failed to produce any evidence in court linking Parks [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2313.5s)]
*  to the crime. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2318.2599999999998s)]
*  In October 2019, the case was dismissed. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2319.9s)]
*  Parks is now the third black man since last summer to come forward and sue for wrongful [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2323.78s)]
*  arrest involving facial recognition. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2328.34s)]
*  Woodbridge police and the prosecutor involved in Parks' case declined to speak with us. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2331.46s)]
*  A spokesman for the town told us that they denied Parks' civil claims in court filings. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2336.46s)]
*  If this has been used hundreds of thousands of times as leads in investigations, and you [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2342.32s)]
*  can only point to three arrests based on a misidentification by this technology, in [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2347.5s)]
*  the balance, is that so bad? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2352.62s)]
*  The fact that we only know of three misidentifications is more a product of how little we know about [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2355.82s)]
*  the technology than how accurate it is. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2360.94s)]
*  Do you think there are more? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2363.74s)]
*  Yes, I have every reason to believe there are more. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2364.74s)]
*  And this is why. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2367.82s)]
*  The person who's accused almost never finds out that it was used. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2368.82s)]
*  Robert Williams says he only found out it was used after detectives told him the computer [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2373.42s)]
*  got it wrong. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2378.5s)]
*  He sued with the help of the ACLU. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2379.94s)]
*  The city of Detroit has denied any legal responsibility and told us they hope to settle. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2382.54s)]
*  While the use of facial recognition technology by police departments continues to grow, so [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2388.58s)]
*  do calls for greater oversight. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2393.54s)]
*  Within the last two years, one city and one state have put a moratorium on the technology [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2396.14s)]
*  and 19 cities have banned it outright. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2401.66s)]
*  More Americans than ever rely on alarm systems, gates, or doorbell cameras to help protect [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2413.2999999999997s)]
*  their families. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2418.5s)]
*  But statistically, you are now more likely to be the victim of theft online than a physical [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2419.7799999999997s)]
*  break-in at home. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2424.7s)]
*  A new report from the FBI reveals that Americans lost more than $10 billion last year to online [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2426.42s)]
*  scams and digital fraud. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2433.1400000000003s)]
*  As we first reported in May, people in their 30s who are among the most connected online [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2435.54s)]
*  filed the most complaints. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2440.98s)]

*  So I was hacked and I failed hacking. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2976.06s)]
*  Everybody would get tricked with that. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2978.7400000000002s)]
*  Everybody would. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2981.02s)]
*  It says, Sharon, why would I not answer this call? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2982.02s)]
*  Why would I not give that information? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2984.66s)]
*  Toback showed us how she took clips of me from television and put it into an app that [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2986.9s)]
*  cloned my voice. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2991.7s)]
*  It took about five minutes. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2993.0s)]
*  I am a public person. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2994.54s)]
*  My voice is out there. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2996.02s)]
*  Could a person who's not a public person like me be spoofed as easily? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=2997.34s)]
*  Anybody can be spoofed. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3001.5s)]
*  Oftentimes attackers will go after people. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3002.9399999999996s)]
*  They don't even know who these people are. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3005.54s)]
*  But they just know this person has a relationship to this other person. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3007.04s)]
*  And they can impersonate that person enough just by changing the pitch and the modulation [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3011.2599999999998s)]
*  of their voice that I believe that's my nephew and I need to really wire that money. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3015.54s)]
*  Toback says hackers no longer need to infiltrate computers through a back door. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3020.5s)]
*  She says 95% of hacks today happen after a user clicks on a text, a link, or gives personal [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3025.14s)]
*  information over the phone. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3032.2999999999997s)]
*  You were able to hack my colleague Elizabeth who is a tech savvy millennial. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3034.8599999999997s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3040.7799999999997s)]
*  Anybody can be hacked. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3042.98s)]
*  Anybody can fall for what Elizabeth fell for. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3044.42s)]
*  In fact, when I do that type of attack, every single time the person falls for it. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3045.98s)]
*  She said hackers armed with basic information like a relative's name found online or an [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3051.06s)]
*  app that can mimic a voice or change the caller ID can create a convincing story. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3056.66s)]
*  If you were to receive a phone call, a text message, an email, and it's asking for something [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3062.94s)]
*  sensitive, urgent, or with fear, that's when the alarm bells have to go off in your head [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3067.2999999999997s)]
*  and they want me to give something to them. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3072.42s)]
*  I'm going to take a beat and I'm going to check that this person is who they say they [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3073.98s)]
*  are. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3077.66s)]
*  I call it being politely paranoid. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3078.42s)]
*  Politely paranoid. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3081.14s)]
*  Be politely paranoid. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3082.02s)]
*  Hary Ravishandran has worked as a consultant for Aura, a Boston-based technology company [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3083.62s)]
*  that created software to protect the identity, passwords, finances, and personal data for [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3087.98s)]
*  entire families in one app. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3094.44s)]
*  So here you can see a full footprint of everything that's happening inside the family. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3097.02s)]
*  Hary Ravishandran is the CEO of Aura. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3101.94s)]
*  He says their software can reroute scam calls away from grandparents. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3105.22s)]
*  If the parent is getting a call and we are identifying using AI that the call is a potential [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3110.46s)]
*  scam call, then they can route that call to me. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3116.62s)]
*  Does this stop the call from getting in? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3120.2200000000003s)]
*  It does. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3122.14s)]
*  So it just blocks the call? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3123.14s)]
*  When the call comes in, it will have a recording that says, let me know who you are, what's [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3124.14s)]
*  your intent. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3129.78s)]
*  If it's an unknown person, if it's a known person that's already in your contacts, it'll [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3130.78s)]
*  go right through. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3133.78s)]
*  Ravishandran says AI is also used to monitor finances and alert users of problems in real time. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3135.46s)]
*  If I see a charge from my mom for $10 at Starbucks, that feels okay. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3142.02s)]
*  But if there's a $500 charge from Starbucks, something's off kilter. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3146.86s)]
*  So we try to figure out with AI contextually what's different. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3150.46s)]
*  But if something is off pattern, you can look at that and say, okay, well, something's off [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3154.5s)]
*  here, I need to go take care of this. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3157.82s)]
*  San Diego Deputy District Attorney Scott Pirello says more help is needed from law enforcement [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3159.26s)]

*  The FBI reports over the past two years, the losses from digital theft have doubled. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3168.74s)]
*  The trends and the data are horrifying. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3174.62s)]
*  We have the senior population is growing exponentially every year. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3177.62s)]
*  We have this dynamic of underreporting. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3182.16s)]
*  And then we have the technology coming. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3184.2999999999997s)]
*  People are convinced that AI is playing a part in maybe pretending it's the grandchild's [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3186.54s)]
*  voice. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3192.98s)]
*  We're all just next on the conveyor belt. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kw1d8YvYE&t=3193.98s)]
