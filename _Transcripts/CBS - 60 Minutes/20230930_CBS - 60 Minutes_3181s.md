**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [September 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA)
*  To stop him, you have to drive a stake through his heart to stop him. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=0.0s)]
*  And though many have come close, he's back. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=18.52s)]
*  Though he's gone from being a really rich man to a mere billionaire, he's maintained [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=21.48s)]
*  the manic energy that drove him to change the landscape of the information age by creating [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=26.48s)]
*  CNN and 24-hour news, the uncompromising competitor who won the America's Cup, the ex-husband [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=32.26s)]
*  of Jane Fonda, the batty billionaire who challenged his archenemy fellow billionaire Rupert Murdoch [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=39.3s)]
*  to a boxing match. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=46.28s)]
*  Once described as both genius and jackass, he's now decided to reflect on a tumultuous [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=48.28s)]
*  life and more or less tell all in a memoir. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=53.88s)]
*  Ted Turner is the largest individual landowner in the United States, owning 2 million acres [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=59.7s)]
*  across 12 states. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=65.16s)]
*  We caught up with him at one of his Montana ranches, this lonesome cowboy who hates his [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  own company. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=73.36s)]
*  You hate being alone. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=74.36s)]
*  I don't like being alone. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=76.36s)]
*  These are big places to be alone. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=78.64s)]
*  I tell you, come out here and spend the night by yourself sometimes. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  You know, the coyotes out there howling. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  It's pretty scary. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=87.4s)]
*  Out here at the Snowcrest Ranch, Ted Turner is not alone. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=88.4s)]
*  He keeps company with bison, horses, and a stream full of ruby river trout. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  Oh, mama mia! [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=99.4s)]
*  That's a real nice fish. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  Life is good for Ted Turner. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  He's not your average old age pensioner. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  This most restless of men jets around the world. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=108.58000000000001s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=111.84s)]
*  Promoting good causes, dreaming up new business ventures, and dropping in on his dozens of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=112.84s)]
*  properties scattered about the hemisphere. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=118.6s)]
*  And now as he turns 70, he's written his book. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=122.0s)]
*  So after his morning ride, the man who proudly says he never looks back decided to do just [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=125.97999999999999s)]
*  that, to let Ted reflect on Ted. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=132.64s)]
*  I've had the good fortune to have a much more diverse life than most people with professional [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=136.6s)]
*  sports and television and news and movies. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=142.92s)]
*  And a fairly spectacular private life too. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=145.92s)]
*  Well, it's been a lot of fun. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=148.4s)]
*  Ted Turner burst on the scene in 1977 when he captained Courageous, the yacht that won [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=150.92s)]
*  the America's Cup. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=157.2s)]
*  As a blotto Turner celebrated, Captain Outrageous emerged. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=159.04s)]
*  But it was his groundbreaking creation of CNN that put Turner indelibly on the map. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=165.6s)]
*  But his company's rapid growth and ballooning debt nearly bankrupted him. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=172.12s)]
*  I was going to go broke if I didn't get things turned around real fast. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=177.48s)]
*  But I was able to get it refinanced without government help, I might add, unlike what's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  going on today. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=186.0s)]
*  But we made it by the skin on our chinny chin chin. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=187.44s)]
*  Two years later we made a run at CBS. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=191.56s)]
*  Unsuccessful, but we did take a swing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=194.84s)]
*  Instead, Turner went on to create his own broadcasting powerhouse. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=197.8s)]
*  And when he merged his company with Time Warner in 1996, his status as media visionary was [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=202.16s)]
*  confirmed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  I didn't care how much adversity life threw at me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  I intended to get to the top. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=212.72s)]
*  The adversity started at infancy, shipped off to boarding school at the age of four, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=215.16s)]
*  followed by years of military school for discipline. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=221.52s)]
*  He says his alcoholic father did everything he could to toughen him up. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=224.84s)]
*  You had a pretty tough father. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=229.56s)]
*  So what? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=231.76s)]
*  You know, lots of people have tough fathers. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=232.76s)]
*  They beat you up. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=234.28s)]
*  No, he didn't beat me up. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=235.28s)]
*  He spanked me. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=236.68s)]
*  Spanked me with a wire hanger? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=237.68s)]
*  Yeah, a couple times. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=239.6s)]
*  But that's pretty traumatic stuff. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=241.57999999999998s)]
*  It was, but it was doing it to make me better. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=243.4s)]
*  You think it made you better? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  I think so. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=247.06s)]
*  At age 21, he began working for his father's outdoor advertising business. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=248.06s)]
*  But shortly after, an event that both shaped and shattered Ted Turner. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  Your father's suicide, that would strike me as something that would be awfully difficult [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=259.6s)]
*  for anybody to get over. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=264.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=266.48s)]
*  Were you out to prove something to him even though he was gone? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=267.48s)]
*  He wanted me to be a big success. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=271.24s)]
*  And all my life I've tried to be a big success. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=273.56s)]
*  So his influence was huge. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=279.16s)]
*  That success is plastered all over the walls of his Atlanta office. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=282.36s)]
*  CNN made Turner into a statesman of sorts, hobnobbing with world leaders. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=286.48s)]
*  But he may be best remembered for the impolitic things he said, insulting Christianity, fellow [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=292.6s)]
*  billionaires, even the Italians. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=299.72s)]
*  Italians, Italians, imagine the Italians at war. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=300.72s)]
*  They'd rather be involved in crime than just making some wine and having a good time. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=304.76s)]
*  His utter inability to self-censor earned Turner the nickname the mouth from the south. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=310.24s)]
*  To some, it was evidence of true mental instability. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  Turner admits he took the drug lithium for a while, but said it had no effect. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=320.68s)]
*  But that didn't stop his rival Rupert Murdoch from questioning his sanity during their legendary [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=326.36s)]
*  war of words. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=332.56s)]
*  His newspapers were pretty brutal in attacking you. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=334.36s)]
*  Oh, all the time. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=337.36s)]
*  They called you crazy. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=338.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=339.36s)]
*  Nuts, I think they said. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=340.36s)]
*  Did detectives follow me around at times? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  At least I think he did. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=344.44s)]
*  I never had any proof of it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=346.6s)]
*  You once said that Murdoch was the most dangerous man in the world. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=348.6s)]
*  Do you still believe that? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=354.0s)]
*  George Bush is the most dangerous man in the world. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=355.0s)]
*  I've made peace with Rupert. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=357.96s)]
*  We had lunch together a few months ago. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=360.44s)]
*  Now there's not anybody I don't like. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=362.84s)]
*  But after this interview's over, I may not like you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=365.48s)]
*  Vintage Ted Turner, as was his joy when he agreed to AOL's merger with Time Warner. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=368.2s)]
*  I did it with as much or more excitement and enthusiasm as I did on that night when I first [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=376.56s)]
*  made love some 42 years ago. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=383.68s)]
*  He was now worth $10 billion, but shortly after the merger, Turner was pushed aside [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=387.64s)]
*  by Time Warner brass, vice chairman of nothing, even though he was the company's largest individual [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  stockholder. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=400.4s)]
*  Then the internet bubble burst and AOL Time Warner's stock went into freefall. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=401.4s)]
*  You were losing nearly $10 million a day for two and a half years. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=408.46000000000004s)]
*  A million a day. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=412.96s)]
*  A million a day for two and a half years? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=413.96s)]
*  Wait a minute, that'd be $700 million. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  You're right, $10 million a day. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=417.52s)]
*  Listen, I get thousands, millions, and billions mixed up. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=419.23999999999995s)]
*  But when you're bleeding $10 million a day, at some point you've just got to say, I'm [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=423.4s)]
*  getting out of this. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  But my kids were all in the stock, most of my friends were, so I sat there loyally and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=428.88s)]
*  went down the drain with everybody else. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=433.96s)]
*  To the tune of $7 billion. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  To Turner, it was apocalypse now. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=438.85999999999996s)]
*  His marriage to Jane Fonda was breaking up. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=441.88s)]
*  A grandchild was gravely ill and he was jobless. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=444.76s)]
*  His five children were worried that, like his father, Turner might take his own life. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=449.32s)]
*  He contemplated suicide then. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=455.04s)]
*  I was really worried when Jane left him and they took away his job the way they did. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=457.08s)]
*  That was the lowest I'd ever seen him. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=464.56s)]
*  He was really depressed and a lot of other things were happening in our family as well, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=465.56s)]
*  so it was a really, really tough time for him. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=468.82s)]
*  He barreled through it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=472.32000000000005s)]
*  And he also got help. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=473.64000000000004s)]
*  He got professional help. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=475.20000000000005s)]
*  He went to a shrink. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=476.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=478.20000000000005s)]
*  And he said he always left his shrink and he cheered his shrink up. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=479.20000000000005s)]
*  He said he would leave him laughing. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=482.48s)]
*  Turner admits he spent more time gallivanting around the globe than he did being a father. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=485.8s)]
*  I think he may be the most restless man I've ever met. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  We never sat down for a meal for more than 15 minutes, I guarantee you. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=495.32000000000005s)]
*  He'd also give the monologue. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=498.8s)]
*  The conversation was his through the whole dinner. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=500.4s)]
*  The operative word is monologue. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  He likes to talk at you. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  So how was your day? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=506.32s)]
*  Time to go. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=508.12s)]
*  After a vacation with Dad, you need a vacation. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=509.12s)]
*  Recently, Turner says he has become a better father and feels his relationship with his [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  children is his greatest achievement. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=517.0s)]
*  If his kids is his greatest achievement, what do you think is his biggest disappointment? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=520.1999999999999s)]
*  I've heard him say his failure of his marriages. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=526.92s)]
*  He's been married three times, most famously to actress Jane Fonda, a union that lasted [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=530.32s)]
*  ten years. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=536.6400000000001s)]
*  You seemed really happy, you and Jane Fonda together. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=538.1600000000001s)]
*  We were for a long time. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=540.7600000000001s)]
*  And what went wrong? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=542.4000000000001s)]
*  It's hard to tell. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=544.1600000000001s)]
*  Obviously, it was a combination of things. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=545.1600000000001s)]
*  Do you wish that the marriage had managed to survive? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=547.1600000000001s)]
*  Well it didn't. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=550.7600000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's no point in sitting around and crying about spilt milk. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=551.7600000000001s)]
*  Gotta move on. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=556.32s)]
*  Moving on is Turner's mantra. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=558.0s)]
*  It also put a hex on his marriage to Jane Fonda. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=560.4s)]
*  It's impossible to really be with Ted the way he needs someone to be with him and have [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=564.28s)]
*  any kind of life of your own. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=569.12s)]
*  He's perfectly aware of it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=571.04s)]
*  He said to me, he said, I hate being alone. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=572.04s)]
*  He's aware that it makes it hard for the person who's trying to love him. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=575.12s)]
*  But what's interesting is the moment he's in one place for a couple of days, he's got [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=579.8s)]
*  to move on to somewhere else. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=584.6s)]
*  When you're chased by demons, you have to keep moving. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=586.6s)]
*  Though they've been divorced for eight years, they're in some way inseparable. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=589.52s)]
*  You know, if Ted really needed me, I would be there in a blue minute. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think he misses you a lot. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  I think he does, yeah. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=602.32s)]
*  I'm not getting emotional because I wish I was still living with him, but he touches [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=608.4s)]
*  me deeply, deeply, the contradictions that make up Ted Turner. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=617.0799999999999s)]
*  Turner admits being a husband is not his strong suit. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=624.4s)]
*  You had a tough time at monogamy, correct? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=628.8199999999999s)]
*  It's a lot easier now. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=631.84s)]
*  Now that you're not married, you mean? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=633.52s)]
*  Well, being 70 too. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=635.52s)]
*  But you still have a lot of girlfriends. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=637.78s)]
*  I still have some. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=639.62s)]
*  I'm dating. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=642.22s)]
*  Turner now dates several women at once, and they all look remarkably alike. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=644.3399999999999s)]
*  They take turns as traveling companions in his restless wandering. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=649.38s)]
*  And he's as generous as ever with his philanthropy. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=653.98s)]
*  He famously pledged a billion dollars to the U.N. and has given another half billion [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=657.5s)]
*  or so to causes he believes in. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=662.78s)]
*  But lest you think Turner has completely withdrawn from business, welcome to Ted's Montana Grill, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=665.62s)]
*  home of the bison burger. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=673.5s)]
*  Turner started the eco-friendly chain as a way of ensuring the survival of his favorite [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=675.78s)]
*  mammal, both on a bun and roaming the prairie. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=681.3s)]
*  So these are bison. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=685.78s)]
*  Don't step in the poop. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=687.9s)]
*  His herd of 50,000 roams on only a few of the 27 properties he owns across North and [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=689.42s)]
*  South America. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=696.58s)]
*  He plans to leave it all to conservation after he's gone. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=698.18s)]
*  When our time's up, it's up. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=702.66s)]
*  And no matter how rich you are, it doesn't matter. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=704.9s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=707.58s)]
*  All the money in the world won't buy you one more day. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=708.58s)]
*  So you might as well give it away. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=711.38s)]
*  Might as well. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=713.62s)]
*  A portrait of a man temporarily at peace, taking a break from his marathon race with [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=714.9s)]
*  life. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=720.66s)]
*  Catch and release, just like those billions that slipped away. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=722.22s)]
*  Out here, l don't have to worry about the seven billion l lost. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=727.86s)]
*  Seven billion, it'll make you stop and think. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=731.26s)]
*  You know, you can't cry over spilt milk, as l said before. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=734.38s)]
*  You gotta press on, my man. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=739.5s)]
*  Aha! [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=741.46s)]
*  Another nice one! [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=742.46s)]
*  Woo hoo hoo! [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=743.46s)]
*  It's interesting how many big, high-tech companies were started by two friends, like Hewlett [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=755.98s)]
*  and Packard or Google's Larry and Sergey. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=761.02s)]
*  Microsoft was too. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=764.4200000000001s)]
*  Bill Gates co-founded his company, one of the most important and successful in American [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=766.4200000000001s)]
*  history, with his high school buddy, Paul Allen. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=771.98s)]
*  Today, Allen is known more for his mega yachts and palling around with Brad and Angelina [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=773.98s)]
*  than for his revolutionary ideas in the company's early years. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=779.98s)]
*  But now, Paul Allen has written a memoir called Idea Man out this week, in which he not only [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=784.62s)]
*  gives an account of those ideas, he draws a dark portrait of his fellow co-founder and [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=790.46s)]
*  lifelong friend. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=796.34s)]
*  As Allen writes and tells us in one of the only in-depth interviews he's ever given, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=798.32s)]
*  he was too angry and proud to tell Gates point blank, quote, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=804.24s)]
*  ''Some days working with you is like being in hell.'' [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=808.6400000000001s)]
*  You describe Bill Gates in very harsh terms. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=813.72s)]
*  You describe him as being quite abusive. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=818.5200000000001s)]
*  l mean, it's not a pretty picture. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=820.44s)]
*  l felt like when l wrote it, l should just tell it like it happened, in an unvarnished [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=823.08s)]
*  way, words and all. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  Here he is, doing such great work. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=830.6800000000001s)]
*  He's almost a saint now. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=834.36s)]
*  And it seems like an odd time to write an unflattering portrait of him. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=836.6800000000001s)]
*  The timing had nothing to do with the many wonderful things that Bill has done. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=842.1600000000001s)]
*  The timing was because l wanted to see if l could do it and hopefully be alive to see [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=846.92s)]
*  it published. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=853.3199999999999s)]
*  No wonder he was concerned. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=854.76s)]
*  When he started the book in 2009, he had stage four lymphoma. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=856.76s)]
*  The book goes back to the beginning. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=861.52s)]
*  This is a picture of Allen when he was 15 and met a boy at his private school in Seattle, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=863.68s)]
*  two years his junior, named Bill Gates. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=869.28s)]
*  This video shows the two buddies revisiting an old computer lab where they used to feed [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=876.08s)]
*  their obsession with programming. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=881.0400000000001s)]
*  You lift me into one of those huge garbage bins. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=883.6800000000001s)]
*  Bill and l would actually dive in the dumpsters to try to find listings of the secret inner [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=889.0400000000001s)]
*  code of the operating system and try to figure out how it worked. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=893.3000000000001s)]
*  That's how passionate we were. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=897.12s)]
*  They both became crack coders. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=898.84s)]
*  But early on, Allen emerged as a creative dreamer, Gates a cold-eyed pragmatist. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=901.32s)]
*  You write that when he was 13 years old, he told you one day we're going to start a company, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=907.6s)]
*  run a company. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=914.24s)]
*  He was saying, well, imagine what it's like to run a Fortune 500 company. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=915.24s)]
*  l'm thinking, l have no idea. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=918.96s)]
*  My parents were librarians. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=921.6s)]
*  You kept bringing him ideas and you write in the book, he was always popping my balloon. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=924.0400000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=929.7600000000001s)]
*  l would have 10 ideas and he would pick them apart one by one. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=930.76s)]
*  One of Allen's ideas Gates didn't shoot down would lead to the personal computer revolution [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=937.12s)]
*  and launch Microsoft. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=942.28s)]
*  It was 1974. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=944.4s)]
*  He was a college dropout working in Boston. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=946.26s)]
*  One day he spotted a magazine announcing a new small computer called the Altair. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=949.4s)]
*  He ran to show it to his friend Gates, then at Harvard. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=954.92s)]
*  l said, here, look at the magazine. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=958.5200000000001s)]
*  This is the computer we've been waiting for. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=960.72s)]
*  This is how the PC, the idea that we all have these computers, this is how it started. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=962.72s)]
*  Yeah, and it's amazing to think back then nobody had personal computers. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=968.84s)]
*  l mean, there were computers in universities and research labs and in corporations, but [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=974.12s)]
*  nobody had personal computers. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=978.76s)]
*  Allen's idea was to write software that would enable the Altair to work as well as those [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=981.4000000000001s)]
*  large computers. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=986.5s)]
*  And so we called up the company that made it and said, well, we can demonstrate this [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=988.3s)]
*  software for you very, very quickly. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=992.34s)]
*  Are you interested? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=994.58s)]
*  And they said, sure, if you can really show up and demonstrate it. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=995.58s)]
*  Did you have software? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=998.66s)]
*  No. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=999.66s)]
*  You had nothing. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1000.66s)]
*  No, we had nothing. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1001.66s)]
*  So they spent the next eight weeks at Harvard feverishly writing code, but without an Altair [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1003.12s)]
*  to test on. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1008.58s)]
*  Allen writes that because Gates looked like he was 13, they decided Allen should go alone [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1010.42s)]
*  to pitch their software. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1015.66s)]
*  Sitting by an old original Altair, he showed me how he fed the computer a paper strip with [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1018.1s)]
*  their code punched into it and typed print two plus two. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1023.54s)]
*  And then I hit return, and lo and behold, it printed four. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1028.78s)]
*  And a wave of relief surged over me because I almost couldn't believe it had worked the [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1034.02s)]
*  first time. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1040.62s)]
*  And then the next night I call Bill up and I say, Billy, it's unbelievable it worked. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1041.62s)]
*  And we were just over the moon. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1045.86s)]
*  It was the beginning of the age of a computer in every home on every desk. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1048.62s)]
*  Almost overnight, people started buying these small computers and their software was in [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1054.04s)]
*  high demand. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1058.86s)]
*  In 1977, Gates was even interviewed on a TV show. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1060.4799999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of people who are forecasting that there'll be software stores just like [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1064.3799999999999s)]
*  record stores today and that there'll be thousands and thousands of those. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1068.7s)]
*  And I think I'd have to agree with that. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1072.86s)]
*  Allen writes that Gates had a rare gift for programming. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1075.3s)]
*  He was also the Schroeder businessman. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1078.72s)]
*  From the beginning, he demanded a larger share of the company, 60 percent and then more. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1081.0s)]
*  But Allen says he was the one who pushed through the company's big early break, developing [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1087.58s)]
*  an operating system for IBM's first personal computer in 1980. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1092.88s)]
*  Yet, as the company soared, Allen didn't want to give up his whole life to Microsoft the [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1098.16s)]
*  way Gates did. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1104.0s)]
*  Well, I've always had so many different interests. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1105.0s)]
*  But do you think he came to think that you weren't working as hard as he was and it became [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1108.0600000000002s)]
*  a source of resentment with him? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1113.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think he was always pushing people to work as hard as they possibly could. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1116.0800000000002s)]
*  You included? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1121.64s)]
*  Maybe me more than everybody else. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1123.0s)]
*  You describe Bill in this period and actually throughout as tough, a taskmaster. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1125.68s)]
*  You talk about his yelling, screaming. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1133.3200000000002s)]
*  There was a lot of yelling. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1138.2s)]
*  You guys never understood. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1139.2s)]
*  You never understood the first thing about this. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1140.6000000000001s)]
*  A 1994 CBS News profile got a sample of Gates' management style, which Allen describes as [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1143.72s)]
*  browbeating and personal verbal attacks. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1150.44s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1154.04s)]
*  I'm not doing this thing. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1155.04s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1156.04s)]
*  Somebody's confused. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1157.04s)]
*  Somebody's just not thinking. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1158.04s)]
*  I mean, there's no way. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1159.04s)]
*  You had to fight back intensely to stand your ground and make your position, your convictions [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1160.04s)]
*  expressed. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1168.8400000000001s)]
*  But he didn't like to back down. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1169.8400000000001s)]
*  So these fights would go on, you said. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1172.04s)]
*  They could go on for hours. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1173.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1175.24s)]
*  That's right. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1176.92s)]
*  We're just screaming at each other for hours? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1178.4s)]
*  And it's exhausting. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1181.0s)]
*  It's exhausting, but that was Bill's style. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1182.3200000000002s)]
*  Allen was miserable and felt he was being marginalized. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1185.3600000000001s)]
*  And then things got a lot worse. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1189.04s)]
*  He got cancer. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1191.04s)]
*  One night he passed by Gates' office and overheard him talking with Steve Bommer, who'd been [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1193.0s)]
*  hired to help run the company. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1197.52s)]
*  What were they saying? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1200.04s)]
*  They were basically talking about how they were planning to dilute my share down to almost [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1201.48s)]
*  nothing. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1205.92s)]
*  And it was really a shocking and disheartening moment for me. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1206.92s)]
*  And you were sick? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1211.48s)]
*  I think I was still probably in the middle of radiation therapy. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1213.24s)]
*  He burst in and interrupted them. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1216.76s)]
*  He says they were trying to cut him out and rip him off. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1219.04s)]
*  And of course, Steve came over to my house later that night to apologize. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1223.6000000000001s)]
*  He did? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1227.0s)]
*  He did. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1228.0s)]
*  But Bill didn't come? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1229.0s)]
*  No, he sent Steve. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1230.0s)]
*  He sent Steve. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1231.96s)]
*  It wasn't Steve. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1232.96s)]
*  He sent Steve. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1234.16s)]
*  Steve's the one who came. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1235.8s)]
*  Shortly after, Allen left. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1238.6s)]
*  But he got to hold on to all his shares. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1241.08s)]
*  It's hard to feel sorry for him. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1244.0s)]
*  He was 30, cured of cancer, and owned nearly a third of Microsoft. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1245.68s)]
*  So you built this building? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1251.08s)]
*  After the company went public, Allen became one of the richest men on earth, at one point [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1254.0s)]
*  worth an estimated $40 billion. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1259.2s)]
*  Deets would spend another two decades running Microsoft, launching Word, Windows, and Explorer. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1262.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1268.8799999999999s)]
*  And once he retired, he devoted himself to eradicating global disease and improving education. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1269.8799999999999s)]
*  Allen has spent his wealth on a hodgepodge of many interests. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1278.12s)]
*  For instance, he plays electric guitar, so he has his own personal rock and roll band [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1283.08s)]
*  to jam with. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1288.3799999999999s)]
*  And he bought Jimi Hendrix Woodstock guitar for $750,000. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1291.72s)]
*  He likes science fiction. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1296.44s)]
*  He subsidizes an antenna farm listening for aliens. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1299.44s)]
*  An avid reader, he showed us a Shakespeare folio he keeps at his estate. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1303.44s)]
*  You became the owner of the Seahawks. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1308.48s)]
*  He likes football. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1311.3600000000001s)]
*  He bought an NFL team. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1312.56s)]
*  He likes basketball even more. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1314.56s)]
*  He also bought an NBA team. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1316.64s)]
*  He's a movie buff, so he invested in DreamWorks, the Hollywood studio. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1319.56s)]
*  He wants to travel, so he built himself a yacht longer than a football field, equipped [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1324.3999999999999s)]
*  with its own submarine. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1329.8s)]
*  He has spent over a billion dollars on philanthropy, including building an institute to study the [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1332.56s)]
*  brain. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1338.48s)]
*  And, like Gates, he's pledged to give most of his money away to charity. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1339.48s)]
*  Now, he got married. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1343.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1346.08s)]
*  You never got married. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1347.08s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1349.2s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1350.56s)]
*  I'm still optimistic. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1351.56s)]
*  I still believe I'm going to meet somebody and that's going to happen. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1352.56s)]
*  But you want to. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1356.8400000000001s)]
*  I want to have a family. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1359.52s)]
*  But he's often described as a recluse. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1361.24s)]
*  Something struck me when he showed us his collection of vintage war planes. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1365.24s)]
*  I get this Howard Hughes-y feel. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1369.92s)]
*  The planes, Hollywood. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1372.44s)]
*  Do you think about that ever? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1376.44s)]
*  Well, I hope I don't end up in a cinema by myself watching Ice Station Zebra over and [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1378.8s)]
*  over again. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1384.6s)]
*  I think I've got such a diverse set of interests, movies, aviation, technology. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1385.6s)]
*  Howard Hughes. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1391.92s)]
*  Well, I don't know if Howard was involved in sports teams. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1392.92s)]
*  Alan's diverse set of interests also led him to invest in over a hundred business ventures. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1396.12s)]
*  Most of them were poorly managed or ahead of their time, so they flopped. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1402.04s)]
*  And he slid from being the third richest man in the world to 57th. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1406.84s)]
*  Were you just too early or was it that you really needed a Bill Gates and didn't have [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1411.52s)]
*  that other person to push it through? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1418.24s)]
*  Look, in Microsoft days you had some great ideas and some great execution between me [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1420.1999999999998s)]
*  and Bill and many other people. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1426.54s)]
*  In technology, most things fail. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1428.72s)]
*  Most companies fail. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1431.12s)]
*  But I had some whoppers. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1433.08s)]
*  Some of his whoppers, however, produce numerous patents. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1434.92s)]
*  Last year, in a move that angered Silicon Valley, Alan sued several giant companies, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1439.0800000000002s)]
*  accusing them of infringing on those old patents. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1444.68s)]
*  Who were you suing? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1448.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's a long list. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1449.1200000000001s)]
*  AOL, Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Office Depot, Office Max, Staples, Yahoo, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1451.64s)]
*  and YouTube. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1460.2800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1461.2800000000002s)]
*  How do you argue that you had something to do with Google? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1462.3999999999999s)]
*  It just seems so outlandish or kind of wacky. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1468.04s)]
*  Look, Microsoft and Google, all these people have patents of their own. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1472.16s)]
*  They all enforce patents. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1476.6399999999999s)]
*  They all charge other companies for patents. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1478.36s)]
*  And all I'm trying to do is get back the investment that I made to create these patents. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1480.52s)]
*  We kept hearing that what he's really trying to do is gain recognition as a tech visionary. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1486.8s)]
*  But with his book, Idea Man, he's being branded a bitter billionaire. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1493.32s)]
*  What's your reaction to people saying it's kind of a revenge book, a bitter book? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1498.72s)]
*  It's not about that. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1506.04s)]
*  I just felt like it's an important piece of technology history, and I should tell it like [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1507.04s)]
*  it happened, and I hope people understand and respect that. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1512.1599999999999s)]
*  But for all the bad feelings Alan writes about with Gates, near the end of the book he reveals [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1515.68s)]
*  something that happened when he got cancer a second time in 2009. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1520.8s)]
*  He came to see you. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1526.5600000000002s)]
*  He comforted you when you were sick. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1528.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1530.52s)]
*  Bill came here to my house multiple times, and we had some great talks. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1531.52s)]
*  There's a bond there that can't be denied, and I think we both feel that. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1536.4s)]
*  Even after the book? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1543.5600000000002s)]
*  I know he's read the book. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1544.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1545.96s)]
*  No, I'm sure at some point we'll sit down and talk about the book, which we haven't [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1546.96s)]
*  done yet. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1551.12s)]
*  You'll have a screaming match? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1552.12s)]
*  Well, I don't know about screaming, but I'm sure it'll be a heated discussion. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1553.12s)]
*  Do you think there's any reason that you're going to have to apologize to him now? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1557.28s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1562.24s)]
*  We asked Bill Gates for a comment, and while he declined, he has said that the founding [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1565.72s)]
*  of Microsoft was an equal partnership, and Paul deserves more credit than he's often given. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1570.64s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1591.5200000000002s)]
*  Beyond your income taxes, how much money would you give to help the government? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1592.8000000000002s)]
*  For one Wall Street Titan, the answer is hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1598.1599999999999s)]
*  David Rubenstein is the All-American. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1602.72s)]
*  At age 65, a self-made billionaire who's pledging a good part of his fortune to save [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1605.8799999999999s)]
*  America's history. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1611.6399999999999s)]
*  When an idea strikes him, he just might write a check for, say, 15 or 20 million dollars. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1612.6399999999999s)]
*  Among his recipients, the Washington Monument, Thomas Jefferson's home, Monticello, and [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1619.56s)]
*  just last week, the Iwo Jima Memorial. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1625.0s)]
*  And he's buying up rare historical documents, preserving them for generations to come. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1628.36s)]
*  This is inside the Washington Monument, the moment an earthquake struck Washington, D.C., [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1635.44s)]
*  in 2011. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1641.8s)]
*  One of the nation's most treasured memorials now had to close. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1643.88s)]
*  It would take a Superman to put it back together again, but in fact, it was Clark Kent, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1649.28s)]
*  in a suit and tie, armed with just a blackberry and a passion for American history. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1654.96s)]
*  It's a monument to our first president and to the Revolutionary War general. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1661.24s)]
*  How did he manage to pull it off? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1665.2s)]
*  Not with muscles, but with money. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1667.4s)]
*  Lots of money. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1670.2s)]
*  It's a shorter version of it. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1671.2s)]
*  Our Clark Kent is David Rubenstein. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1672.4s)]
*  When he heard about the damage, he offered to pay the 15 million dollars it would take [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1675.24s)]
*  to repair it. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1680.48s)]
*  Isn't that what government is supposed to do? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1681.88s)]
*  Well, the government doesn't have the resources it used to have. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1684.04s)]
*  We have gigantic budget deficits and large debt. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1686.76s)]
*  I think private citizens need to pitch in. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1689.96s)]
*  Co-chair of the Campaign for the National Mall, David Rubenstein. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1692.04s)]
*  Congress not wanting to be shown up by a single patriotic American ended up offering to split [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1695.72s)]
*  the bill, and the monument reopened to much fanfare last spring. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1701.96s)]
*  He's so far spent over 50 million dollars on rare historical documents like original [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1708.08s)]
*  copies of the Declaration of Independence and the Emancipation Proclamation, which now [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1714.32s)]
*  hangs in the Oval Office. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1720.08s)]
*  And he's looking to spend millions more to restore national monuments like the Lincoln [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1722.48s)]
*  Memorial and the homes of the founding fathers. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1727.72s)]
*  In honor of George Washington, we built the Washington Monument. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1731.4399999999998s)]
*  We met up with him at Mount Vernon, George Washington's home, where he gave us a tour [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1735.1599999999999s)]
*  and an impromptu history lesson which led inevitably to the founders' teeth, or absence [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1740.28s)]
*  thereof. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1746.76s)]
*  George Washington only had one tooth, and he used that one tooth to kind of hold in [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1747.76s)]
*  his dentures. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1752.04s)]
*  And they were called wooden teeth, but not because they were wood. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1753.28s)]
*  They were animal teeth. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1756.0s)]
*  But he had a doctor in New York whose name was Dr. Greenwood, and it was shortened to [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1757.32s)]
*  wooden teeth. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1761.56s)]
*  What they do is they take animal teeth, put them together in a denture. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1762.8s)]
*  But you need something to hook it onto. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1765.8s)]
*  So he had his one tooth, and that's why you'll never see a picture of him with his mouth [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1767.1399999999999s)]
*  open because it didn't look good. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1770.48s)]
*  You're somewhat of a George Washington scholar. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1772.56s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't say a scholar, but I'd say a fan. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1775.0s)]
*  Why did you choose him? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1778.52s)]
*  As it was said at his funeral, he was first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1780.1399999999999s)]
*  of his countrymen. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1784.1399999999999s)]
*  Unlike most multi-billionaires, Rubenstein doesn't have a foundation and personally oversees [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1785.44s)]
*  each gift from his modest Washington office. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1791.84s)]
*  How do you make the judgment? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1795.52s)]
*  Because you don't have a staff, correct? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1797.48s)]
*  I don't have a staff, but I generally look at things where my money will make a difference. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1799.08s)]
*  And in patriotic philanthropy, I think I can do some things because not as many people [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1804.34s)]
*  are doing things in medical research or other kinds of areas like that. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1807.9599999999998s)]
*  But you seem to make these decisions spur of the moment. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1810.8799999999999s)]
*  Sometimes the best decisions of life are on the spur of the moment. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1813.8s)]
*  So I generally try to do what I think is right, and sometimes I make mistakes. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1815.9599999999998s)]
*  Care to talk about your mistakes? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1819.12s)]
*  It would take more than 60 minutes. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1821.12s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1822.9199999999998s)]
*  Rubenstein's foray into patriotic philanthropy began on a whim when on a business trip to [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1824.84s)]
*  New York, he heard the last privately held copy of the 800-year-old British Magna Carta [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1831.6s)]
*  would be auctioned off the next day and would most likely leave the country. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1838.0s)]
*  Rubenstein sent his wallet into action. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1843.1599999999999s)]
*  The head auctioneer came in and said, you just bought the Magna Carta. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1846.04s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1849.8s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1850.8s)]
*  And I explained and they said, okay, you can be yours if you have the money. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1851.8s)]
*  You do have the money for this. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1855.6s)]
*  I said yes. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1856.6s)]
*  And they said, okay, you can leave the side door, nobody ever know, or there's a hundred [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1857.6s)]
*  reporters who want to know who bought it. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1860.72s)]
*  And I said, I will go out and talk to them to tell them that I'm giving it to the country [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1862.6399999999999s)]
*  in effect as a down payment on my obligation to give back to the country. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1866.12s)]
*  What are the symbols on the seal? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1869.6s)]
*  Beyond the $21 million purchase price, Rubenstein built a multimillion dollar center at the [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1872.08s)]
*  National Archives to showcase the documents that served as the inspiration not only for [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1879.32s)]
*  our Bill of Rights, but for all Western democracy. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1885.3999999999999s)]
*  If you're better informed about American history, you can be a better citizen. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1888.3999999999999s)]
*  His friend Warren Buffett says Rubenstein's approach is unique. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1892.96s)]
*  He may wake up in the morning without knowing what that philanthropic act is going to be [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1897.66s)]
*  by sundown, but something will spark his interest and when it does, he can move. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1901.6s)]

*  Have you ever had any offers of somebody who's come forth with his attitude and his dough? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1915.68s)]
*  Not really. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1923.88s)]
*  I think David is somewhat unique and is sort of occupying this space of patriotic philanthropy [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1925.0400000000002s)]
*  at the moment. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1930.0800000000002s)]
*  What else has he offered to pay for it? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1931.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, the next big project he did after the Washington Monument was the Robert E. Lee [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1933.5200000000002s)]
*  Memorial, which sits at Arlington Cemetery. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1938.48s)]
*  He gave us $12.3 million to do a full restoration. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1941.04s)]
*  And then he has also offered, just recently, $5 million to restore the Marine Corps War [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1944.92s)]
*  Memorial, the Iwo Jima. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1951.96s)]
*  David recognized that this is an opportunity to give back to the country and also to recognize [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1953.68s)]
*  the Marine Corps, where his father served. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1958.96s)]
*  The people in the house are wondering, who are these crazy people who are out here? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1961.1200000000001s)]
*  They probably wonder whether I'm about to be indicted for something. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1965.1200000000001s)]
*  He traveled with Rubenstein and his mother Betty to the home he grew up in in Working [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1967.7199999999998s)]
*  Glass Baltimore. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1972.6799999999998s)]
*  His father was a mail sorter at the post office. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1974.4399999999998s)]
*  When I was growing up here, I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do, but I thought [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1978.08s)]
*  one thing I didn't want to do was what you wanted me to do. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1983.3999999999999s)]
*  My dream from a small child up that you become a dentist. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1986.28s)]
*  Rubenstein disappointed his mother and instead went to law school. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1990.76s)]
*  Then at age 27, he landed a job in the White House, an advisor to President Carter. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=1995.84s)]
*  How would you rate yourself as a public servant? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2002.24s)]
*  I enjoyed it very much. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2005.0s)]
*  I'm not sure the country enjoyed what I did for the country. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2006.0s)]
*  I like to say that there was a rumor that I was going to be promoted in the second term, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2008.4s)]
*  and that's why President Carter lost. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2012.16s)]
*  And since I have left the White House, I can tell you honestly, nobody's ever invited me [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2014.28s)]
*  back. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2018.8s)]
*  When he was booted from the White House along with Jimmy Carter in 1980, Rubenstein tried [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2019.8s)]
*  lawyering but says he was terrible at it. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2025.36s)]
*  So in 1987, he and two partners decided to start one of the first D.C.-based investment [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2029.1999999999998s)]
*  firms, which they named after a New York hotel. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2036.08s)]
*  What made you decide to call the company Carlyle? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2040.28s)]
*  Carlyle sounded kind of British and it sounded kind of maybe not aristocratic, but sounded [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2044.9199999999998s)]
*  like you've been around for a while when we really hadn't been around. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2049.52s)]
*  We were new. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2051.7599999999998s)]
*  It's now a global giant, over $200 billion in assets. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2052.92s)]
*  For years, the firm had a reputation as politically connected and secretive. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2058.28s)]
*  Carlyle's success made Rubenstein a fortune. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2064.48s)]
*  He says his wife Alice and three kids support his decision to give most of it away. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2067.44s)]
*  In the end, it's not clear that if you give a child $500 million, he or she will win a [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2073.84s)]
*  Nobel Prize for doing something. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2079.0s)]
*  And I think if you give somebody too much money, it can force them not to work as hard [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2081.08s)]
*  and be as productive. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2084.7599999999998s)]
*  A cardinal sin in Rubenstein's eyes. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2085.7599999999998s)]
*  And in 2010, he was one of the first to sign on to the giving pledge with Bill Gates and [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2089.2799999999997s)]
*  Warren Buffett, promising to give away at least half of his billions to worthy causes. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2095.12s)]
*  I think many of the members of the giving society, and certainly including David, would [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2103.36s)]
*  like to have their last check bounced. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2107.04s)]
*  I mean, that's the goal. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2108.68s)]
*  It's a little hard to time things perfectly, so that happens. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2110.2799999999997s)]
*  But there's no Forbes 400 in the graveyard. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2113.3599999999997s)]
*  Like Warren Buffett, Rubenstein isn't flashy. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2116.3999999999996s)]
*  He drives a 20-year-old car. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2119.6s)]
*  He doesn't drink or smoke, but he's allowed himself one super luxury, a $65 million plane [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2121.8199999999997s)]
*  he uses to fly around the world, an average of 200 days a year. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2129.52s)]
*  He is a man in motion, appearing on TV. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2134.44s)]
*  It's a global investment world that we're dealing with. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2137.96s)]
*  Boosting his firm. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2140.28s)]
*  And I started the first buyout firm in Washington, D.C. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2141.64s)]
*  Sitting on 26 non-for-profit boards. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2145.04s)]
*  How many people have never been here before? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2147.96s)]
*  And taking his stand-up comedy routine on the road. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2150.08s)]
*  I became the Deputy Domestic Policy Advisor to the President of the United States, a job [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2153.64s)]
*  I obviously wasn't qualified for, but Carter wasn't qualified either, I thought, so. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2157.44s)]
*  When you became wealthy enough to sort of sit back, you remained a workaholic. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2161.64s)]
*  That's not worked for me. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2167.84s)]
*  I am not under any pressure or stress when I'm doing this. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2168.84s)]
*  When I am trying to relax, if I ever do that, that's when I'm under stress. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2172.08s)]
*  And I think I'm more likely to have a heart attack when I'm relaxing than when I'm under [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2176.6000000000004s)]
*  working. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2180.8s)]
*  It takes a lot of brains to do what we do. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2181.8s)]
*  Looking for a way to make some dough for you. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2184.84s)]
*  Work now including learning how to rap after Carlyle doubled its money in an investment [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2187.32s)]
*  in the headphone company Beats by Dre. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2193.7400000000002s)]
*  For global, for mobile, for aiming to please, only go online, serve at LPs. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2197.2s)]
*  I did meet Dr. Dre when we were first doing the deal and we did a takeoff on that for [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2201.7599999999998s)]
*  our holiday video. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2205.72s)]
*  I haven't done anything like this really since my bar mitzvah. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2206.72s)]
*  And when I did it, it was supposed to take five minutes and it took about four hours. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2210.0s)]
*  And they had a young rap coach for me to explain how to do this and he said, Mr. Rubenstein, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2214.4399999999996s)]
*  you are the whitest man I've ever met in my life. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2219.0s)]
*  How were the legs after going up the stairs? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2221.3199999999997s)]
*  I didn't need a defibrillator. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2223.4399999999996s)]
*  I didn't have to go to the hospital. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2224.4399999999996s)]
*  Rubenstein may use self-deprecation as a form of bragging and if you don't get the message, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2225.68s)]
*  he puts his name on his good works. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2233.6s)]
*  $20 million here, $75 million there, soon adds up to real money. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2236.16s)]
*  He even joked he put his initials at the top of the Washington Monument. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2242.84s)]
*  I took my pen out and I put my initials at the very top of the Washington Monument. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2246.96s)]
*  So if you ever get there, you'll see my initials. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2250.0s)]
*  How important is the recognition? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2254.44s)]
*  Because you put your name on most of the things you support. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2256.44s)]
*  Is that, I think, what, to use a Yiddish word, chutzpah? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2260.08s)]
*  Maybe I have a character flaw and I haven't done it as anonymously because I'm trying [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2264.44s)]
*  to say to people, I came from very modest circumstances and look what I was able to [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2268.2400000000002s)]
*  do. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2272.52s)]
*  You can do the same thing. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2273.52s)]
*  And while the vast majority of his wealth goes to inanimate objects, Rubenstein took [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2274.52s)]
*  care of D.C.'s favorite residents, mama bear Mei-Zhang, papa bear Tian-Tian, and baby bear [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2280.2s)]
*  Bao-Bao when the National Zoo ran out of money. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2288.6s)]
*  I said, okay, I'll put up the money to keep them here because the Chinese rent pandas. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2292.6s)]
*  You pay a million dollars a year, more or less, and you get two pandas. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2296.7999999999997s)]
*  And the money goes for panda conservation. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2300.6s)]
*  Sweet potatoes, right? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2303.7599999999998s)]
*  Pandas are the biggest attraction at the zoo. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2305.28s)]
*  And when the government had its shutdown, people weren't calling in to say they weren't [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2307.96s)]
*  getting their Social Security checks or Congress wasn't moving forward with anything. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2311.7200000000003s)]
*  They were saying the panda camp was shut down. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2314.6800000000003s)]
*  Richard Nixon first brought the pandas to the U.S. after his historic trip to China [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2317.76s)]
*  in 1972. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2323.84s)]
*  Panda diplomacy may have worked, but panda love life is another matter. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2326.5600000000004s)]
*  You've compared the relationship between male and female pandas with U.S. Congress. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2331.96s)]
*  Members of Congress know what they're supposed to do, but they don't know how to do it. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2336.6s)]
*  The pandas know what they're supposed to do, but they fumble. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2339.52s)]
*  They come here with the best of intentions, but sometimes things don't work out the way [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2341.6800000000003s)]
*  that they're supposed to. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2345.04s)]
*  So it's bye-bye Bao-Bao, and thank you, Mr. Rubenstein. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2346.6s)]
*  So I don't think anything I've said has impressed Bao-Bao. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2352.2400000000002s)]
*  No, no. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2354.92s)]
*  In this era of belt-tightening, it's kind of refreshing to take a look at people whose [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2361.92s)]
*  happiest pastime is to give money away. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2372.48s)]
*  Such a man is 77-year-old Eli Broad, a self-made billionaire art collector and, for the past [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2375.84s)]

*  of a city, Los Angeles, into a cultural capital. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2395.0s)]
*  Eli Broad thinks big, but his critics say he can act very small, that he may give billions [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2399.16s)]
*  away, but he tries to micromanage almost every dollar he gives. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2405.76s)]
*  Eli Broad doesn't really care what they say. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2411.16s)]
*  All he wants to do is die poor. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2414.36s)]
*  Well, relatively poor. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2417.72s)]
*  I believe in two things. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2421.16s)]
*  One, Andrew Carnegie said, he who dies with wealth dies in shame. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2422.72s)]
*  And someone said, he who gives while he lives also knows where it goes. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2429.68s)]
*  There's no one quite so civic-minded in America. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2436.72s)]
*  Eli Broad and his wife Edie have become paparazzi pets because of the money they lavish on Los [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2440.28s)]
*  Angeles. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2446.72s)]
*  So far, more than half a billion dollars. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2448.08s)]
*  Who says money can't buy you love? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2452.6s)]
*  And Eli, your love of life, right here, please. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2455.08s)]
*  Behold his footprint on Los Angeles. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2457.56s)]
*  He's a driving force behind 16 major public institutions. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2460.2s)]
*  In the center of downtown, a cultural corridor anchored by the magnificent Disney Hall, home [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2465.16s)]
*  of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2471.6s)]
*  Next to it, the home of the Los Angeles Opera, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the High School [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2477.12s)]
*  for the Performing Arts, and the School of Music. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2483.2s)]
*  In greater Los Angeles, three scientific research centers, a theater, an art center, and another [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2487.0s)]
*  contemporary art museum. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2494.3199999999997s)]
*  He puts his name on almost all of them. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2496.48s)]
*  You've said that your sense of being a wealthy man actually increased the more you gave money away. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2500.4s)]
*  I think it's true. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2509.0s)]
*  I don't feel I'm here to just maintain a status quo. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2511.08s)]
*  I'm here to make things better or different. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2513.76s)]
*  And you want the world to know about it by putting your name on all the things you do support. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2516.48s)]
*  I don't keep it a secret, that's for sure. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2521.44s)]
*  Broad took us to Grand Avenue. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2524.52s)]
*  This is quite a vista, which he plans to transform into a vibrant city center, rivaling New York's [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2526.56s)]
*  Museum Mile. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2533.04s)]
*  Disney Hall, designed by Frank Gehry, almost did not get built. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2534.72s)]
*  Broad rescued the project by putting up his own money and putting the squeeze on fellow plutocrats. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2539.36s)]
*  It's really become the symbol of our city. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2546.24s)]
*  And then there's his own museum, the Broad. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2548.88s)]
*  This is a rendering. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2551.7999999999997s)]
*  It's still a parking lot. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2553.32s)]
*  But it will eventually hold his $1.6 billion art collection. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2555.12s)]
*  How much is this going to cost? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2560.2s)]
*  Something approaching a billion dollars? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2562.6s)]
*  More. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2564.4s)]
*  More? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2565.4s)]
*  More. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2566.4s)]
*  We were interrupted by an Angelino driving by. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2567.4s)]
*  Eli, buy the Dodgers! [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2570.08s)]
*  Buy the Dodgers! [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2572.48s)]
*  Eli, buy the Dodgers! [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2574.24s)]
*  You could be the George Steinbrenner of Los Angeles. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2576.16s)]
*  I've got enough on my plate. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2579.2s)]
*  Broad runs his philanthropic foundation like a for-profit business, not a charity. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2582.24s)]
*  Charity, he says, is just writing checks. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2588.16s)]
*  He practices what he calls venture philanthropy. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2591.6s)]
*  We don't give it away. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2595.6s)]
*  We invest it, and we want a return. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2596.6s)]
*  Remember, I started work as a CPA, so that gave me fiscal discipline in everything I [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2598.3999999999996s)]
*  did in business. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2603.9599999999996s)]
*  I guess some of it carries over to philanthropy. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2604.9599999999996s)]
*  Eli Broad says, I want results. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2607.8799999999997s)]
*  And if you're not going to show me results, I'm not going to give you the money. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2610.36s)]
*  And incidentally, after one year, if you don't show me results, I'm going to stop funding [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2612.92s)]
*  you. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2616.48s)]
*  New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, no mean philanthropist himself, admires Broad's uncuddley [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2617.48s)]
*  approach and the $32 million he's given to New York schools. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2623.28s)]
*  Eli Broad sets the standard. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2628.56s)]
*  I think it's really being a role model for others. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2630.04s)]
*  They look at Eli, and because of him, they get the ideas, I'm going to be innovative [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2632.96s)]
*  and be philanthropic and do some other things. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2638.68s)]
*  The leverage of Eli Broad is really quite amazing. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2641.64s)]
*  Amazing to the extent of almost half a billion dollars he's poured into improving public [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2645.28s)]
*  education. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2649.68s)]
*  He spends even more on medical research. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2651.16s)]
*  Eight years ago, he teamed up with Harvard and MIT to create, you guessed it, the Broad [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2654.16s)]
*  Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2660.52s)]
*  The Broad is the world's leading genomic medicine institute. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2664.36s)]
*  All discoveries are free, available to anyone. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2668.08s)]
*  Let me be rude and ask, how much have you put into this institute? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2672.1200000000003s)]
*  $600 million total. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2676.56s)]
*  Broad grew up in Detroit, the only child of immigrant shopkeepers. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2679.08s)]
*  At 21, he married Edie Lawson. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2683.28s)]
*  We borrowed $25,000 from our parents. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2686.2000000000003s)]
*  And that $25,000 led ultimately to... [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2689.48s)]
*  A lot of money. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2692.76s)]
*  In 1957, Broad and a partner launched a no-frills home building business. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2694.24s)]
*  He was a millionaire by 27. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2700.2799999999997s)]
*  He bought Sun Life Insurance in 1971 and sold it in 1999 for $18 billion. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2703.12s)]
*  And that's when he and Edie decided to give most of it away. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2711.56s)]
*  You're giving 75% of your wealth away. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2715.8399999999997s)]
*  Maybe more by the time it's over. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2720.16s)]
*  Or maybe more. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2721.68s)]
*  You have two children. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2722.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2724.36s)]
*  What about them? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2725.0s)]
*  They're well taken care of. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2726.36s)]
*  They're different than their dad. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2728.84s)]
*  Different how? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2730.6800000000003s)]
*  They don't have, frankly, the ambition to build a great business that I had. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2731.92s)]
*  You've been open about admitting that you were not a great father. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2738.52s)]
*  Look, when I started, it was 24-7, as they say. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2743.52s)]
*  And I didn't spend enough time with the kids when they were growing up. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2747.56s)]
*  I admit that. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2750.52s)]
*  Is that something you regret now? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2751.44s)]
*  I do to some degree. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2753.76s)]
*  We all go back and would do things over differently in our lives. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2755.84s)]
*  Today, Broad balances his life with his passion for contemporary art, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2759.88s)]
*  like this Richard Serra sculpture. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2765.04s)]
*  Civilizations are not remembered by their business people or bankers or lawyers. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2767.48s)]
*  They're remembered by the arts. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2771.96s)]
*  He's collected over 2,000 works of art. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2773.92s)]
*  Unlike most collectors, almost all of Broad's art is available for loan to museums. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2776.92s)]
*  He loaned these pieces to the LA County Museum of Art [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2783.1600000000003s)]
*  and threw in a $50 million building to house them. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2787.04s)]
*  One of his favorite artists is the irrepressible Jeff Koons. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2791.12s)]
*  And here, a veritable cornucopia of Koonsian genius. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2795.6s)]
*  All, of course, painted and sculpted by hired craftsmen. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2800.84s)]
*  Koons is nothing if not worshipful of Eli Broad. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2805.56s)]
*  You know, Morley and Eli, I just have to say standing here, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2810.24s)]
*  what a fantastic location. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2814.52s)]
*  I mean, look at the natural light that's coming in on these works. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2816.48s)]
*  It's just a tremendous gallery. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2820.4s)]
*  And the balloon dog, what does it do to you? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2823.2s)]
*  Do you get some kind of emotional kick? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2825.84s)]
*  I do. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2827.72s)]
*  It makes me smile, makes me feel good. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2828.4s)]
*  It makes me proud. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2831.24s)]
*  It especially makes me proud when I see young people and others looking at the work. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2832.92s)]
*  And it introduces them to art in a way that no other work really does. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2837.6s)]
*  And a piece that, quite honestly, mystifies me. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2842.56s)]
*  Michael Jackson and the Chimp, is it? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2847.84s)]
*  Michael Jackson and Bubbles. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2850.96s)]
*  When I made this series, the banality series, I won... [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2853.64s)]
*  Series of banality? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2856.6s)]
*  Of images. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2858.6800000000003s)]
*  I was trying to communicate to people that whatever you respond to, it's perfect. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2859.8s)]
*  If you find Koons' art speak incomprehensible, well, just wait. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2865.36s)]
*  These are to make references to be in the womb a little bit, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2870.2000000000003s)]
*  before birth and prior to any kind of concept of death. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2874.1600000000003s)]
*  Do you totally get what he's talking about? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2879.2400000000002s)]
*  Not to the extent that Jeff does. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2881.6000000000004s)]
*  But I do listen, understand and learn from artists, especially Jeff. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2883.8s)]
*  But not all artists are as respectful as Jeff Koons. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2889.6s)]
*  Take architect Frank Gehry. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2893.52s)]
*  Eli's the control freak. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2895.52s)]
*  I worked on a house for him. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2898.08s)]
*  I didn't want to do it. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2900.04s)]
*  Why didn't you want to do it? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2901.52s)]
*  I just told him I didn't like him. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2902.7599999999998s)]
*  He said, you'll learn to like me. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2904.92s)]
*  Road fired Gehry, then built the house anyway, using Gehry's drawings. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2907.2s)]
*  After two years and seven different models, I was impatient. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2912.6s)]
*  I think he want to spend another year or two designing it. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2917.72s)]
*  I said, Frank, a work of art is never finished, it's only abandoned. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2921.16s)]
*  They worked together again three years later to build Disney Hall. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2925.44s)]
*  And once again, Road fired Gehry. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2929.8799999999997s)]
*  But he had to eat humble pie when the Disney family insisted that he hire Gehry back. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2933.08s)]
*  We did it, we built it. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2939.16s)]
*  We weren't friends. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2941.52s)]
*  You've made your peace with him at the same time you... [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2942.8399999999997s)]
*  I won't do a project for him, that's true. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2946.2799999999997s)]
*  Eli's middle name is Strings Attached. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2949.3999999999996s)]
*  Eli Strings Attached Road. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2952.04s)]
*  Christopher Knight, the art critic for the Los Angeles Times, has been road watching for years. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2954.2799999999997s)]
*  He's a first generation, male, self-made gazillionaire. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2960.6s)]
*  And people in that category typically believe, and with good evidence, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2967.68s)]
*  that they know how to make something a success. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2976.12s)]
*  And that can be a problem. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2979.12s)]
*  With science, Road leaves the details to the experts. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2981.4s)]
*  But when he dangles his money and his art in front of most major museums in L.A., [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2984.72s)]
*  he sees himself as the expert. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2990.08s)]
*  And if they don't play, he won't pay. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2992.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I'm a perfectionist. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2995.8s)]
*  And on things I know something about, I do get involved. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=2997.92s)]
*  We've talked to a number of people who say that you can turn into a bully. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3001.36s)]
*  I don't think I'm a bully, but on the other hand, I'm not a potted plant, I'm... [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3007.6400000000003s)]
*  No, I'm sure you're not a potted plant. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3011.28s)]
*  These people who say some pretty unkind things about you will not talk publicly. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3013.48s)]
*  They clearly are scared of you. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3019.44s)]
*  I don't know why they're scared of me. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3021.96s)]
*  Well, because you're a rich guy and therefore a powerful guy. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3023.76s)]
*  And you've got a temper. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3027.6800000000003s)]
*  I've got strong views on things. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3029.6000000000004s)]
*  But even your good friend, Frank Gehry, says, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3031.6000000000004s)]
*  Eli can be a real pain in the ass. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3036.6400000000003s)]
*  I can understand why Frank could say that. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3039.6800000000003s)]
*  Because I am impatient, and patience has its limits. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3042.36s)]
*  Number one, it's his money. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3047.2000000000003s)]
*  And you don't have to take it. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3048.88s)]
*  So I'm sympathetic with that. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3050.0800000000004s)]
*  Eli is not a micromanager as much as he has ideas on how you can make society better. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3052.7599999999998s)]
*  And he's devoting his own money to doing it. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3058.8399999999997s)]
*  Kind of hard to argue with that he doesn't have the right to do it. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3061.64s)]
*  And you don't have to play the game if you don't want to. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3064.8799999999997s)]
*  When you've got one 800-pound gorilla in the room, you're scared to death of the guy. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3067.3599999999997s)]
*  Everybody does want something from Eli. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3072.3999999999996s)]
*  And since he is the biggest game in town, nobody wants to alienate him. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3075.2s)]
*  I just appreciate you all so much. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3078.68s)]
*  Just watch this crowd at the recent gala for the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3082.48s)]
*  which Brode bailed out two years ago for $30 million. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3088.32s)]
*  It was a scrum of culture vultures, fashion victims and art victims, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3093.0s)]
*  dealers and collectors, a night when skinniness was next only to godliness, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3097.64s)]
*  when philanthropy and social climbing, self-aggrandizement and greed [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3104.08s)]
*  dissolved into one gigantic air kiss, all under the benevolent eye of that [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3109.12s)]
*  feared and admired dictator, Eli Brode. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3115.32s)]
*  Beyond the altruistic part of it, ego plays a part in this? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3119.44s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3123.36s)]
*  A desire to be loved? [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3124.4s)]
*  A desire to be respected. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3125.88s)]
*  I'm not doing these things to become the most popular person in the city. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3128.2400000000002s)]
*  I want to be the most respected person. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3132.84s)]
*  We left him on the roof of his art foundation. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3135.4s)]
*  This fully contented man, this master of all he surveys. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3138.36s)]
*  What's this at the very end here? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3144.32s)]
*  I know what this is. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3148.2400000000002s)]
*  What is it? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3149.6800000000003s)]
*  It's Bigfoot. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3150.92s)]
*  It is Bigfoot. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3152.2400000000002s)]
*  And who is the biggest foot in Los Angeles right now? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3153.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3156.8s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4fh1woqFA&t=3158.0s)]
