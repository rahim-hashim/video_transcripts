**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0)
*  The [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=0.0s)]
*  Las Vegas Hotel and Casino In the past year, hospitals, pharmacies, tech [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  companies, Las Vegas' biggest hotels and casinos have been paralyzed by ransomware [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  attacks, in which hackers break into a corporate network, encrypt or lock up critical files, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=24.82s)]
*  and create. It's a crime that has been growing more costly and disruptive every year. Now, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=29.98s)]
*  cybersecurity researchers fear it's about to get worse. With the emergence of an audacious [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=35.78s)]
*  group of young criminal hackers from the U.S., U.K., and Canada, the FBI calls scattered [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=41.7s)]
*  spider. More troubling, they have teamed up with Russia's most notorious ransomware gang. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=48.18s)]
*  This past September, one of the most pernicious ransomware attacks in history was unleashed [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=59.92s)]
*  on MGM resorts, costing the hotel and casino giant more than $100 million. It disrupted [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=65.28s)]
*  operations at a dozen of the most renowned gaming palaces on the Las Vegas Strip. MGM [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=73.48s)]
*  Grand, Aria, Mandalay Bay, New York, New York, the Bellagio. Anthony Curtis is a Las Vegas [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=79.64s)]
*  fixture. He's so good at counting cards, he's been banned from card games here. He now publishes [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=90.04s)]
*  the Las Vegas Advisor, a monthly newsletter on all things Vegas. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=97.16s)]
*  Incredibly, when it happened, I was in an MGM property, and it happened while we were [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=102.68s)]
*  having dinner, and there just began to be a rumbling that something was going on. When [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=108.12s)]
*  I went down into the casino, I could see then that slot machines were sitting dark, people [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=111.44s)]
*  were scrambling around, the shutdown was starting to take effect. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=116.48s)]
*  Across the Vegas Strip, thousands of slot machines suddenly stopped paying out. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=120.44s)]
*  So all of a sudden now people are going, how do I get my money, what's wrong? And the people [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=126.04s)]
*  were sitting there waiting and couldn't get paid. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  Were they angry? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=131.8s)]
*  They were getting angry, yeah. And this was just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=132.8s)]
*  Elevators were malfunctioning, parking gates froze, digital door keys wouldn't work. As [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=137.24s)]
*  computers went down, reservations locked up and lines backed up at the front desks. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=143.96s)]
*  Anything that required technology was not working. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  Sounds like chaos. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=154.0s)]
*  Nobody knew what to do. And including the employees, the employees just had to beg forgiveness [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=155.28s)]
*  and patience. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  Look, it's corporate terrorism at its finest. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  The company declined our interview request, but at a conference a month after the hack, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=165.12s)]
*  MGM's CEO admitted the disruptions were devastating. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  For the next four or five days, with 36,000 hotel rooms and some regional properties, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=175.68s)]
*  we were completely in the dark. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=181.22s)]
*  The hackers demanded $30 million to unlock MGM's data. The company refused, but they [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=182.76s)]
*  still paid a price. $100 million in lost revenue and millions more to rebuild their [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=190.08s)]
*  servers. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  So how did the intruders get in? Through a technique of deception and manipulation called [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  social engineering. First, hackers zeroed in on an employee, gathering information from [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  the dark web and open sources like LinkedIn. Next, a smooth talking hacker impersonating [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  the employee called the MGM tech help desk and convinced them to reset his password. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=217.28s)]
*  With that, the hacker was inside MGM's computers and unleashed the destructive malware. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=225.04s)]
*  Anthony Curtis says it was the cyber criminals version of an Ocean's Eleven heist. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=233.08s)]
*  They're doing it the old-fashioned way. I mean, they're doing it the new way, but with [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=238.72s)]
*  the old-fashioned goal, they want to get the money. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=241.2s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=243.4s)]
*  I don't want to be too glowing like I like these guys, because they're just crooks, right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=244.52s)]
*  But these hackers were able to turn the tables. The casinos have their systems, they have [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  their protections, they have their experts, they have their security. These guys are better. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=256.4s)]
*  Later, MGM's biggest competitor, CSRS, admitted it also suffered a social engineering attack [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=261.44s)]
*  around the same time, suspected by the same group. But CSRS paid a ransom, reportedly [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=268.24s)]
*  $15 million, and suffered no disruptions. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=275.24s)]
*  From an FBI perspective, our position is we recommend a ransom not be paid, but we understand [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=279.92s)]
*  it's a business decision during a time of crisis. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=285.68s)]
*  Brian Vorndren is head of the FBI's cyber division. He told us ransomware attacks have [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  grown increasingly brazen. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=294.8s)]
*  Any way you look at the numbers, it's a problem for the global economy and for the U.S. economy [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=297.4s)]
*  and for the security of the United States. There's estimates that global losses exceed [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=303.4s)]
*  one billion U.S. dollars per year. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  Have you made any arrests in the Las Vegas cases? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=310.28s)]
*  We're not going to talk about specific cases or specific companies with... [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=313.76s)]
*  But he did point us toward the prime suspect. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=317.76s)]
*  When we talk about the actors behind some of the more recent ransomware attacks, the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=320.91999999999996s)]
*  name that's generally raised is Scattered Spider, and that's a criminal group that we [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=326.52s)]
*  have a lot of attention on because of the havoc they're wreaking across the United States. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=331.0s)]
*  Scattered Spider is what the FBI calls a loose-knit web of predominantly native English-speaking [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=336.2s)]
*  hackers responsible for the casino hacks and dozens more. Their specialty is social engineering. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  Part of their success is because they are fluent in Western culture, they know how our society [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=350.12s)]
*  works, they know what to say to get someone to do something. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=355.12s)]
*  Allison Nixon is chief research officer at Unit 221B, a cyber security firm that focuses [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=358.72s)]
*  on English-speaking cyber criminals. She says Scattered Spider is just one of many illicit [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=366.12s)]
*  hacking groups, all part of a sprawling collection of online criminals calling themselves the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=373.12s)]
*  community or the com. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=379.4s)]
*  The com is a subculture. It is specifically an English-speaking youth subculture that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=382.0s)]
*  has arisen in the past few years. It's very new, but it's surprisingly disruptive. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=389.32s)]
*  Members of the com have hacked into companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Electronic Arts. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=397.16s)]
*  How many people are involved? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=403.8s)]
*  Years ago it was maybe a few hundred people, but since 2018 the population has exploded [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=406.16s)]
*  because of the money coming into these groups. And there's thousands of people involved at [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=413.36s)]
*  this point. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  How are they connected? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  They connect over the internet, social spaces where people hang out, gaming servers. It's [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=421.08000000000004s)]
*  almost analogous to like maybe the back alley where the bad kids hang out, but on the internet. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=428.16s)]
*  How old are we talking about? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=435.04s)]
*  Males under the age of 25. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  Under 25 down to how young? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=438.64000000000004s)]
*  Like 13, 14. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=441.92s)]
*  Involved in pulling off major crimes? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=446.52000000000004s)]
*  Members communicate and post pictures on messaging apps like Telegram. They're chatter, a toxic [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=447.64000000000004s)]
*  stew of racism, sexism, boasting about the money they've scammed and how menacing they [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=454.0s)]
*  are. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  There are these toxic online spaces where young people can socialize and mingle with [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=461.48s)]
*  criminals and gang members. And the end result of all of this is this online subculture has [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=466.88s)]
*  formed that glorifies crime, that measures one's personal worth by how much harm they [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=472.68s)]
*  can cause the world. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=480.26s)]
*  Scattered Spider is one of the most sophisticated offshoots of the com. Their criminal exploits [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=482.26s)]
*  caught the attention of cybersecurity companies and other hackers, including the most notorious [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=488.0s)]
*  Russian ransomware gang, Black Cat. They saw the young native English speaking Westerners [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=494.6s)]
*  as a force multiplier. Both claimed credit for the MGM attack. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=501.36s)]
*  Historically speaking, Russian cyber criminals did not like working with Western cyber criminals. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=506.72s)]
*  There was not only a language barrier, but also they kind of looked down on them and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=514.08s)]
*  viewed them as unprofessional. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=519.6s)]
*  The Russian and Western hackers met in the shadowy corners of the dark web and now are [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=522.0s)]
*  powerful partners in crime. Scattered Spider uses its English and social engineering skills [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=527.5600000000001s)]
*  to break into Western companies' networks. Black Cat provides its experience and its [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=534.0s)]
*  malware used in some of the most shocking ransomware attacks, including the 2021 attack [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=539.48s)]
*  on Colonial Pipeline, which caused gas shortages up and down the East Coast, and this year's [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=547.28s)]
*  attack on United Health Group, which disrupted pharmacies nationwide. The State Department [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=554.16s)]
*  is offering a $15 million reward for information on Russia's Black Cat. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=560.32s)]
*  This is Black Cat's data leak site. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=566.16s)]
*  John DiMaggio, a former analyst at the National Security Agency, now investigates ransomware [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=569.24s)]
*  as chief security strategist for the cybersecurity company Analyst One. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=576.16s)]
*  So there's a term, it's called ransomware as a service, that's been given to the structure [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  and the format of these gangs. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=586.4399999999999s)]
*  DiMaggio says ransomware as a service has taken the crime to a new level. The long-established [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=588.7199999999999s)]
*  Russian gangs like Black Cat offer their services, malware, experience negotiating ransoms and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=595.76s)]
*  laundering money to what they call affiliates like Scattered Spider. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  So in return, when a victim pays an extortion, the profit that comes from it is now shared [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=607.0799999999999s)]

*  a hacker to defeat a hacker. That's the value NSA can bring is we can identify people, specific [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=706.2s)]

*  launch the cyber attacks. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1522.12s)]
*  So why do you think President Biden has said a cyber attack from Russia is coming? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1523.84s)]
*  Well, I think the reality is that those sanctions will not come off, that the economic pressure [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1530.84s)]
*  on Russia will continue, and they're going to start retaliating for that in cyberspace [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1535.32s)]
*  once it hits them, that this is permanent, that this is not going away, and they're going [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1539.52s)]
*  to try to look for ways to press us economically in retaliation, and cyber is a perfect way [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1543.84s)]
*  for them to do so. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1549.1599999999999s)]
*  Because cyber is a battlefield where Russians have an advantage, a target-rich environment [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1551.32s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1557.6s)]
*  The reality is that we have way too many targets. If you look particularly in our energy sector, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1559.3999999999999s)]
*  you have regional utilities, you have minor energy processing companies, storage companies, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1563.76s)]
*  pipeline companies, and make no mistake, Bill, the cyber actors that they have are top-notch, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1569.3999999999999s)]
*  and they've demonstrated that time and time again. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1574.52s)]
*  We have said in the past that if you do this to us, we will respond in kind, would we? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1576.7s)]
*  We have to let them know that you will not touch our critical infrastructure without [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1582.22s)]
*  a response, and the way to do that, I think, is through a cyber operation that can demonstrate [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1585.98s)]
*  our capabilities without lasting damage. One of the ways you can do that, for example, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1590.26s)]
*  is by taking Russia off the Internet for a few hours. It won't cause any lasting impact, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1594.66s)]
*  but it will demonstrate the power of the United States cyber command, what we can do to his [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1599.28s)]
*  economy by disconnecting him effectively from the Internet. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1603.9s)]
*  We can do that? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1607.1000000000001s)]
*  We can absolutely do that. And we'll let him know that if he keeps going, if he keeps attacking [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1607.8600000000001s)]
*  us, we can make that permanent. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1612.14s)]
*  If there's one thing we can't live without in our modern world, it's electricity. It [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1622.7800000000002s)]
*  provides heat and light, pumps water and fuel, refrigerates food, and breathes life into [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1627.74s)]
*  our TVs, computers, and phones. So it's no surprise the North American electric grid, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1633.44s)]
*  which creates, moves, and delivers our electricity, is considered the most critical part of our [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1639.64s)]
*  critical infrastructure. What is surprising is the nature of the grid itself, a hodgepodge [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1645.2s)]
*  of public and privately owned half-century-old tech that is increasingly vulnerable to severe [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1651.64s)]
*  attacks, and even physical assaults. As we first reported earlier this year, no government [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1658.76s)]
*  agency, not even the Department of Energy, is truly in charge of protecting it. One attack [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1665.16s)]
*  nine years ago was a wake-up call for industry and government alike. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1671.28s)]
*  There's been a major transformer leak. This is at a PG&E substation. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1678.28s)]
*  On the night of April 16, 2013, a mysterious incident south of San Jose marked the most [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1682.8s)]
*  serious attack on our power grid in history. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1689.6s)]
*  PG&E tells us someone may have fired some shots into that transformer. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1693.0s)]
*  For 20 minutes, gunmen methodically fired at high-voltage transformers at the Metcalf [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1697.96s)]
*  Power substation. Security cameras captured bullets hitting the chain-link fence. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1704.1200000000001s)]
*  They knew what they were doing. They had a specific objective. They wanted to knock out [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1710.0s)]
*  the substation. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1713.52s)]
*  At the time, John Wellinghoff was chairman of FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1715.32s)]
*  a small government agency with jurisdiction over the U.S. high-voltage transmission system. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1721.8s)]
*  You were concerned enough that you flew out there. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1728.44s)]
*  That's correct. And I took two other individuals who trained special forces, U.S. special forces. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1730.72s)]
*  They trained people to actually attack infrastructure. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1736.88s)]
*  And what the former commandos found looked familiar. They discovered the attackers had [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1739.76s)]
*  reconnoitered the site and marked firing positions with piles of rocks. That night, they broke [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1745.16s)]
*  into two underground vaults and cut off communications coming from the substation. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1751.56s)]
*  Then they went from these vaults across this road over into a pasture area here. There [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1757.36s)]
*  were at least four or five different firing positions. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1763.9599999999998s)]
*  No real security. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1768.0s)]
*  There was no security at all, really. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1769.24s)]
*  They aimed at the narrow cooling fins, causing 17 of 21 large transformers to overheat and [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1771.08s)]
*  stop working. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1778.52s)]
*  They hit them 90 times, so they were very accurate. And they were doing this at night [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1779.9599999999998s)]
*  with muzzle flash in their face. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1785.4799999999998s)]
*  Someone outside the plant heard gunfire and called 911. The gunmen disappeared without [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1787.8s)]
*  a trace about a minute before a patrol car arrived. The substation was down for weeks, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1794.32s)]
*  but fortunately PG&E had enough time to reroute power and avoid disaster. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1801.0s)]
*  If they had succeeded, what would have happened? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1807.04s)]
*  Could have brought down all Silicon Valley. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1808.6799999999998s)]
*  We're talking Google, Apple, all these guys. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1810.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes, that's correct. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1813.8799999999999s)]
*  Who do you think this could have been? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1815.48s)]
*  I don't know. We don't know if they were a nation state. We don't know if they were domestic [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1817.52s)]
*  actors, but it was somebody who did have competent people who could, in fact, plan out this kind [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1822.6799999999998s)]
*  of very sophisticated attack. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1829.6799999999998s)]
*  The grid is a sprawling target. There are actually three in the U.S., the Eastern, Western, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1831.6799999999998s)]
*  and Texas has its own. Most of us rarely notice substations. There are 55,000 across the country, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1838.4s)]
*  each housing transformers, the workhorses of the grid. Inside these massive metal boxes, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1846.6000000000001s)]
*  raw electricity is converted to higher or lower voltages. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1854.0800000000002s)]
*  Should a transformer explode, like this one in Manhattan during Superstorm Sandy, the [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1859.0800000000002s)]
*  system is designed to trigger a localized grid-preserving blackout. But if several sections [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1866.72s)]
*  of the grid go down at the same time, the shutdowns can cascade like dominoes. That's [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1873.96s)]
*  what set off the Great Northeast Blackout in 2003, leaving 45 million Americans without [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1880.96s)]
*  power. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1887.96s)]
*  A few months before the assault on Metcalf, John Wellinghoff of FERC commissioned a study [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1890.0s)]
*  to see if a physical attack on critical transformers could trigger cascading blackouts. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1896.44s)]
*  It was actually a very shocking result to us that there's very few number of substations [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=1902.44s)]

*  got cold, they would do things like, you know, go into their car in the garage to try to [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2160.38s)]

*  Department of Energy is so bad. So, you know, I took it upon myself to do some data crunching. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2209.74s)]
*  And what I found is that 38 percent of the electric disturbance events in the United [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2216.18s)]
*  States are due to physical attacks. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2222.1s)]
*  Thirty-eight percent? That's a lot. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2224.06s)]
*  So in the past decade, there have been over 700 physical attacks against the U.S. electric [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2226.22s)]

*  and Ann Neuberger, Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber. They told us the administration's [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2272.18s)]
*  infrastructure plans should help secure the grid, but acknowledge the threats are real. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2279.22s)]
*  We have physical threats to the grid. We have natural threats to the grid. We have cyber [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2286.02s)]

*  We don't have one system. We have several grids. We also have individual energy ecosystems [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2349.84s)]
*  in regions and states. And that's part of our strength because the resources for energy [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2356.4s)]
*  are different in different regions. And we have to acknowledge that we're not going to [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2361.6s)]
*  have a one size fits all system. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2365.28s)]

*  We have seen an increase in reported threats, but vigilance is heightened right now just [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2477.54s)]

*  could spin out in the U.S. By the time we had gathered for our interview, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2491.58s)]
*  it had already spun out in the United States. In Illinois, a six-year-old Palestinian-American [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2497.08s)]

*  that are about to change the world in artificial intelligence, biology and computing are falling [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2617.7s)]
*  into the wrong hands, stolen in a global espionage campaign by China. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2624.58s)]
*  The People's Republic of China represents the defining threat of this generation in [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2631.02s)]
*  this era. There is no country that presents a broader, more comprehensive threat to our [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2636.26s)]
*  ideas, our innovation, our economic security and ultimately our national security. We have [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2641.1400000000003s)]
*  seen efforts by the Chinese government, directly or indirectly, trying to steal intellectual [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2647.78s)]
*  property, trade secrets, personal data, all across the country. We're talking everything [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2654.14s)]
*  from Fortune 100 companies all to smart start-ups. We're talking about agriculture, biotech, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2659.2599999999998s)]
*  healthcare, robotics, aviation, academic research. We probably have somewhere in the order of [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2664.54s)]
*  2,000 active investigations that are just related to the Chinese government's effort [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2670.98s)]
*  to steal information. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2676.98s)]
*  But all countries spy. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2678.8799999999997s)]
*  Mike Burgess of Australia. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2680.3399999999997s)]
*  Yes, absolutely all countries spy. Our countries spy. All governments have a need to be covertly [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2681.98s)]
*  informed. All countries seek strategic advantage. But the behaviour we're talking about here [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2686.7400000000002s)]
*  goes well beyond traditional espionage. This scale of the theft is unprecedented in human [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2692.46s)]
*  history and that's why we're calling it out. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2698.1400000000003s)]
*  They were calling it out this past week in private meetings with 15 top Silicon Valley [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2700.42s)]
*  executives and Stanford University. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2706.86s)]
*  This is not just about government secrets or military secrets. It's not even just about [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2710.34s)]
*  critical infrastructure. It's about academic research in our universities. It's about promising [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2715.78s)]
*  start-up companies. People, in short, who probably don't think national security is [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2721.5s)]
*  about them. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2727.26s)]
*  Ken McCallum is Director General of MI5, the UK's FBI. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2728.5s)]
*  So we see the theft happening in a range of ways. One is that we see employees within [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2734.1800000000003s)]
*  those companies being manipulated. Often in the first instance they're not aware of what [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2739.04s)]
*  is happening. We have seen, for example, the use of professional networking sites to reach [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2743.6s)]
*  out in sort of masked, disguised ways to people in the UK, either who have security clearance [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2749.24s)]
*  or who are working in interesting areas of technology. We've now seen over 20,000 examples [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2755.32s)]
*  of that kind of disguised approach to people in the UK who have information that the Chinese [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2761.16s)]
*  state wishes to get its hands on. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2766.92s)]
*  You have the biggest hacking program in the world by far, bigger than every other major [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2768.8s)]
*  nation combined, stolen more of our personal and corporate data than every nation, big [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2774.52s)]
*  or small, combined. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2780.6000000000004s)]
*  Are you saying that it is a threat to the way of life of democracies? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2782.76s)]
*  It is a threat to our way of life in a number of ways. The first is that when people talk [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2788.52s)]
*  about stealing innovation or intellectual property, that's not just a Wall Street problem. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2794.66s)]
*  That's a Main Street problem. That means American jobs, American families, American livelihoods, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2800.46s)]
*  and the same thing for every one of our five countries directly impacted by that theft. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2805.8599999999997s)]
*  It's not some abstract concept. It has flesh and blood, kitchen table consequences. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2811.74s)]
*  Here's one example. When China stole the technology secrets of one American wind turbine company, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2817.8199999999997s)]
*  the company lost its competitive advantage, sales collapsed, and it laid off nearly 700 [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2824.46s)]
*  workers. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2831.3s)]
*  When you encounter a company that isn't sure that it wants to cooperate with you, what [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2832.2200000000003s)]
*  do you tell them? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2837.02s)]
*  I would say that if you are operating at the cutting edge of tech in this decade, you may [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2838.54s)]
*  not be interested in geopolitics, but geopolitics is interested in you, and you would be reckless [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2843.46s)]
*  not just with my secrets, but with your own company's viability, with your shareholders' [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2850.3999999999996s)]
*  capital if you didn't think about what that means. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2855.3199999999997s)]
*  We all came into these meetings with the mindset of we want to figure out how we can better [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2858.4399999999996s)]
*  help protect you, your innovation, your intellectual property. They all came into the conversations [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2863.72s)]
*  with ideas of ways they can help us help them. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2869.68s)]
*  The intelligence chiefs told us Chinese companies are overseen by the Communist Party, and for [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2874.54s)]
*  many, espionage is a sideline on behalf of the PRC, the People's Republic of China. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2881.54s)]
*  Is the Chinese government building industrial sites in your countries that are actually [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2889.16s)]
*  covers for espionage operations? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2896.58s)]
*  David Vigno of Canada. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2899.74s)]
*  We have seen in the past acquisition of land, acquisition of different companies, where [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2901.78s)]
*  when you start to dig a little bit further, you realize that there is another intent. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2909.98s)]
*  And we have seen and blocked attempt by the PRC to acquire locations near sensitive strategic [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2916.34s)]
*  assets of the country where we knew that the ultimate purpose was for espionage operations. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2924.6200000000003s)]
*  Mr. Ray, have you seen that in the United States? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2930.78s)]
*  We've seen a variety of efforts by Chinese businesses, some cases state-owned enterprises, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2932.7400000000002s)]
*  some cases ostensibly private companies, attempting to acquire businesses' land, infrastructure, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2939.46s)]
*  what have you, in the United States in a way that presents national security concerns. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2946.94s)]
*  Including investigations recently of Chinese companies purchasing land and building plants [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2952.1400000000003s)]
*  near U.S. military bases. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2958.8599999999997s)]
*  We welcome business with China, visitors from China, academic exchange. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2961.14s)]
*  What we don't welcome is cheating and theft and repression. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2966.3399999999997s)]
*  Political repression is another target of the Five Eyes. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2971.06s)]
*  They told us they're fighting China's meddling in elections and violence aimed at silencing [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2975.18s)]
*  Chinese dissidents living in their countries. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2982.2999999999997s)]
*  We had a case that was indicted not that long ago where there was an actual congressional [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2985.58s)]
*  candidate who was very critical of the Chinese government. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2991.34s)]
*  The efforts were initially to try to see if they could come up with dirt on the candidate [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=2997.4s)]
*  to derail his candidacy, then to try to concoct dirt, just fiction, about the candidate. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3003.42s)]
*  And then if that didn't work, there was even discussion about the candidate befalling [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3012.78s)]
*  a horrible accident. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3017.48s)]
*  That candidate was Yang Shan, a Chinese-American who served in the U.S. military and protested [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3020.34s)]
*  China's crackdown on Hong Kong. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3027.3s)]
*  Last year he lost the Democratic nomination in a New York congressional race. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3030.5400000000004s)]
*  In court filings, prosecutors say a Chinese agent hired an American private investigator [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3035.6600000000003s)]
*  to discredit Yang and left the investigator a voicemail saying, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3042.44s)]
*  violence would be fine. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3047.12s)]
*  Beat him until he cannot run for election. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3050.0s)]
*  Is that the threat of violence in the United States that we face from the Chinese government? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3053.2799999999997s)]
*  We have seen over and over again efforts to really stop at almost nothing to intimidate [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3058.72s)]
*  people who would have the audacity here in the United States where we have freedom of [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3064.94s)]
*  speech to express criticism of the regime. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3069.56s)]
*  While we have the allies around the same table, let me ask this question. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3072.84s)]
*  The catastrophe in the Middle East, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Chinese espionage on [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3077.04s)]
*  a scale that's never been seen before, are all of you stretched too thin? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3083.48s)]
*  I think one of the strengths of the Five Eyes Partnership is that we share some really fundamental [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3088.44s)]
*  values as countries and as agencies. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3094.68s)]
*  Andrew Hampton of New Zealand. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3097.48s)]
*  Part of how you respond to that is by working together as like-minded countries. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3099.68s)]
*  Part of how you respond to it is partnering across our own countries as we've talked [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3104.8s)]
*  about with community groups, with the private sector. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3108.48s)]
*  They're our biggest strength. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3112.52s)]
*  For its part, China said this about the Five Eyes' point of view, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3114.54s)]
*  We firmly oppose the groundless allegations and smears toward China. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3120.16s)]
*  MI5's Ken McCallum told us, never in his nearly 30 years in intelligence has the threat [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3126.1200000000003s)]
*  been so complex. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3133.6000000000004s)]
*  Iran, Russia, terrorism. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3135.48s)]
*  But it was China that was the first to get the Five Eyes around this table and before [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3139.0800000000004s)]
*  the eyes of the public. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3145.32s)]
*  Essentially, what you have with the Chinese government is the autocracy and oppressive [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3147.44s)]
*  regime of East Germany combined with the cutting edge technology of Silicon Valley. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3153.2s)]
*  And the combination represents a daunting first of its kind threat for the United States [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3160.12s)]
*  and for our allies. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3165.88s)]
*  You seem to be saying that the Chinese government is running a criminal enterprise. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3167.18s)]
*  Well, I would say the Chinese government, if they want to be a great nation, it's time [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3171.08s)]
*  for them to start acting like one. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3175.2s)]
*  And that includes abiding by its own commitments not to steal innovation. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3178.12s)]
*  That includes not exporting repression to other countries. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3182.36s)]
*  That includes working with all of our countries and all the other countries that we work with [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3186.88s)]
*  all the time who have common threats like cyber crime, fentanyl trafficking, money laundering. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3192.2400000000002s)]
*  It means not working with criminals, but rather working to uphold the rule of law. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPodxy8zlX0&t=3198.36s)]
