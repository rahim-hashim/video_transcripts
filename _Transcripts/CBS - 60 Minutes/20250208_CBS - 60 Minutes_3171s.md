# Game of Thrones, Kathryn Bigelow, Ken Burns, Tyler Perry | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [February 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8)

*  But don't let the dragons and magic fool you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=35.96s)]
*  This is no kids show. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  The characters are complex and the storylines full of graphic violence, sex, and shocking [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=40.8s)]
*  surprises. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=46.36s)]
*  Whether you're a fan or not, we thought you'd be interested to learn the unlikely story [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=47.36s)]
*  of how Game of Thrones began and how it turned into one of the most popular television series [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=52.800000000000004s)]
*  ever made. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  Game of Thrones is set in the mythical seven kingdoms of Westeros, whose ruler historically [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=66.12s)]
*  sits on the Iron Throne. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=72.64s)]
*  Feuding families vie for power. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=76.0s)]
*  I have only loved one woman. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=78.48s)]
*  Manipulation and murder, tools of the trade. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=80.64s)]
*  Your sister. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=83.56s)]
*  A giant wall protects the seven kingdoms. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=88.92s)]
*  Winter has come and with it the threat of total annihilation from a seemingly unstoppable [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=93.16s)]
*  army of the dead. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=98.92s)]
*  For you, what is the show about? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=100.8s)]
*  Power. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=103.08s)]
*  Power. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=104.08s)]
*  What it does to someone, how much we covet it, how it goes wrong in the wrong hands, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=105.08s)]
*  and how different it is when you have it versus when you're coveting it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=110.32s)]
*  Emilia Clarke plays Daenerys Targaryen, also known as the Mother of Dragons. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  She leads armies, raised dragons, and has killed a lot of people in her quest to take [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=118.88s)]
*  the Iron Throne. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  It's extraordinary the sheer number of ways that people are killed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's incredible. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=129.2s)]
*  We really kill them good. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=130.48s)]
*  Daenerys is pretty old school with her burning. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=132.84s)]
*  But I guess the dragons also can eat people. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=135.2s)]
*  Indeed, but they like to char them before they... [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=137.24s)]
*  A burn is always involved in a dragon. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=140.2s)]
*  They like their meat cooked. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=142.72s)]
*  It's a hard fall down these steps. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=143.72s)]
*  Serious, as every hurt is a lesson. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=146.72s)]
*  Actress Maisie Williams is Arya Stark, a teenager seeking revenge for the murder of her father. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  How many people have you killed? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=155.88s)]
*  Oh gosh, I've lost count. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  I think in the book she has the highest kill count. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  Williams was 12 when Game of Thrones started. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  She's now 22. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=164.84s)]
*  This was her first acting job. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=166.68s)]
*  I didn't even want to be an actor. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=168.72s)]
*  I wanted to be a dancer and then my second audition was for Game of Thrones and then [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  it all just... [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  There are actors all over the world right now listening to that screaming. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  The things I do for love. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  George R.R. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=182.64s)]
*  Martin is the novelist behind this murder and magic. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=183.64s)]
*  In 1996, he published the first in his series of books called A Song of Ice and Fire. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  For years, Hollywood pursued him trying to turn his books into movies. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=192.48s)]
*  Their approach was inevitably to simplify. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=197.08s)]
*  Well, okay, these books are too big. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=199.16000000000003s)]
*  We have to cut it all down. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=201.24s)]
*  I didn't want it simplified. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=202.8s)]
*  So I said repeatedly the sexiest word in Hollywood, no. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=204.68s)]
*  That's the sexiest word in Hollywood? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  But no, I don't want to do it until David and Dan came along. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  That earlier part of the sequence was pure CG. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=213.72000000000003s)]
*  David and Dan are David Benioff and Dan Weiss. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=216.68s)]
*  At the time, they were young screenwriters and novelists with no television experience. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=219.88000000000002s)]
*  But they loved the massive scale of Martin's story. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=225.76s)]
*  I mean, no disrespect, you were relatively novice in this realm of television. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=228.76s)]
*  It's not disrespectful, it's a fact. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=234.2s)]
*  I mean, we'd never produced anything. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=235.76s)]
*  You'd never produced anything? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=237.12s)]
*  We thought we were facing was a real uphill battle of trying to explain to him why he [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=238.88s)]
*  should avoid all of these film offers and accept these two guys who've never made a [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=244.16s)]
*  television show before in their lives. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=250.04s)]
*  And really, he just wanted to know if we knew the books. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=252.16s)]
*  They knew the books cold and convinced Martin that if HBO signed on, they would make an [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=255.24s)]
*  epic cinematic television series that was true to his story. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  I knew that none of the conventional networks were ever going to put this on, not without [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=264.92s)]
*  taking out all the sex and 97% of the violence and making it a kiddie show that was on at [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  eight o'clock. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  I wasn't going to let that happen. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  HBO agreed, seeing it as a series about much more than just dragons and occasional magic. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  If you have a story that is about the human heart in conflict with itself, about these [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=284.24s)]
*  very basic human emotions, about love and ambition and greed for power, it doesn't matter [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  if there's a dragon in it or if it takes place on an alien planet or if it takes place in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=296.36s)]
*  Falkner's Mississippi. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=300.8s)]
*  Human stories are human stories? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  Human stories are human stories. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  The rest is just furniture. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  I drink and I know things. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=308.24s)]
*  That focus on the humanity of the characters is what appealed to Peter Dinklage. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=311.0s)]
*  He plays Tyrion Lannister, an outcast member of the ruling family of Westeros. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=315.54s)]
*  Dinklage was the first actor to sign on, despite reservations about the fantasy genre. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=321.2s)]
*  Dwarves in this genre always have pointy shoes and big beards and they're relegated to either [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=327.56s)]
*  comic relief or angry warriors without romance and human characteristics, really. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=332.64s)]
*  And that just doesn't attract me as an actor. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=339.72s)]
*  But this guy, Tyrion Lannister, has all of that and then some. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=342.68s)]
*  Dinklage recommended Lena Headey to play his sister, the cunning and ruthless Cersei Lannister. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  I love my brother. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=355.12s)]
*  By the way, she also happens to be in an incestuous relationship with her other brother, Jaime, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=357.24s)]
*  played by Nikolai Kostor-Waldau. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=362.56s)]
*  I mean, I read the script and then I was like, who, what? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  I couldn't remember half the characters in there. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=366.76000000000005s)]
*  It is confusing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=368.32000000000005s)]
*  You read names, all of them, then you don't remember the names. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=369.32s)]
*  I felt like that in the beginning. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=371.36s)]
*  So I was like, who's going to watch incestuous twins, dragons, like, you know, I mean, part [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=372.36s)]
*  of you thinks, I don't know. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=377.88s)]
*  And then it shattered all of that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=379.24s)]
*  Game of Thrones was shot in 10 different countries at dozens of locations, many in remote and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=383.2s)]
*  desolate places. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=390.08s)]
*  Hundreds of crew members worked behind the scenes and in all more than 12,000 extras [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=392.4s)]
*  were used. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=397.2s)]
*  The detail was critical. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=400.16s)]
*  Major battle scenes sometimes took weeks to shoot and had to be carefully choreographed. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=402.04s)]
*  And then there are the dragons. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=412.08s)]
*  The challenge was making them as lifelike as possible, especially when actress Amelia [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=413.72s)]
*  Clarke was supposed to be riding on them. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=417.96000000000004s)]
*  Those scenes start as cartoon-like animation in a process called pre-visualization. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  Amelia Clarke was then filmed riding what in early episodes was a pretty low-tech contraption. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=427.2s)]
*  You're riding on a hard green shell. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=433.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  And then there was like a pole by the end and it was essentially like the dudes on the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  railway who, eh, eh, eh. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=439.56s)]
*  And I'm there kind of trying to like, yes, badass! [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=441.44s)]
*  And everyone's like, no, look badass! [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  You look like Harry Potter. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=446.88s)]
*  You look like you're on a broomstick. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=447.88s)]
*  And people are just kind of looking around being like, it looks kind of weird. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=449.92s)]
*  It doesn't look weird, however, when edited together with special effects. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=453.96s)]
*  Legs. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=458.24s)]
*  Shoulder. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=459.24s)]
*  Legs. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=460.24s)]
*  Shoulder. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=461.24s)]
*  Some of the most important sets they actually built from the ground up, like Castle Black, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=462.24s)]
*  which is in a quarry outside Belfast. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=467.04s)]
*  Actor Kit Harrington, who plays one of the central characters, Jon Snow, showed us around. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=470.08s)]
*  But it's so interesting that they built, uh, I mean, you feel like this is an actual castle [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=475.12s)]
*  that's been here for hundreds of years. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=480.44s)]
*  It's not some sort of CGI creation. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=482.44s)]
*  That was always with Thrones what I felt was amazing, because there was a level of detail [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=484.8s)]
*  that went beyond what the audience see. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=489.2s)]
*  Jon Snow was killed in Castle Black and then magically brought back to life. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=491.6s)]
*  Other main characters weren't so lucky. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=497.36s)]
*  Ned Stark, played by actor Sean Bean, appeared to be one of the most important characters [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=500.92s)]
*  in the beginning of the series. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=505.44s)]
*  Then he got his head chopped off before the end of season one. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=506.76s)]
*  I could not believe you killed off Ned Stark. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=510.76s)]
*  I have this reputation of being exceptionally bloodthirsty. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=513.92s)]
*  In person you don't seem very bloodthirsty. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=517.76s)]
*  Star Wars kills more people than I do. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=520.52s)]
*  I mean, right in the opening of Star Wars they unleashed the Death Star against the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=522.76s)]
*  planet Alderaan. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=526.36s)]
*  Right, but you don't know who's living on Alderaan. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=527.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=529.8s)]
*  Death should mean something. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=530.8s)]
*  So, I try to make you feel the deaths. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=531.8s)]
*  I don't necessarily have more than any other people, but I try to make you feel them more. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=534.0s)]
*  After Ned Stark was killed, all the actors realized their characters could be next. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=539.12s)]
*  We get all the scripts in one package. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=544.04s)]
*  All the scripts for that season in one package? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=547.28s)]
*  Yeah, we always go to the end. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=548.28s)]
*  The last page of the last script of episode 10 and go backwards. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=549.48s)]
*  To see if you were alive? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=554.3s)]
*  To see if I die. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=555.3s)]
*  Yeah, you just wanted to go out in a heroic way at least. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=556.3s)]
*  You don't want to go out like off screen like, hey, did you hear about Tyrion? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=558.6s)]
*  Ah, what? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=561.76s)]
*  He died. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=562.76s)]
*  You don't want to go out that way. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=563.76s)]
*  The level of brutality in Game of Thrones has been controversial, particularly scenes [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=567.2s)]
*  of sexual violence and degrading treatment of women. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=571.8000000000001s)]
*  Actors, Gwendolyn Christie, Liam Cunningham and John Bradley say there's a reason for [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=575.0s)]
*  showing it all. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=580.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, terrible things happen to some of the women on the show. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=581.1600000000001s)]
*  This story is loosely based on the War of the Roses, and I would say learn. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=585.2s)]
*  Learn that this is what has happened in history and this is not what needs to happen in the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=593.2s)]
*  future. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=598.0400000000001s)]

*  Violence is disgusting. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=601.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=602.9200000000001s)]
*  We show kind of the reality of it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  The unpleasant, ugly nature of what human beings are capable of doing to other human [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=606.2s)]
*  beings. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=610.1600000000001s)]
*  Now that the final season is about to start, there are plans to shoot a prequel series. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=611.1600000000001s)]
*  And HBO intends to turn Castle Black and other locations in Northern Ireland into tourist [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=616.24s)]
*  attractions. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=621.32s)]
*  The shops used in the show are still stored in a warehouse outside Belfast. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=623.16s)]
*  Look, a dragon. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=627.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=628.3599999999999s)]
*  It's a baby dragon. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=629.3599999999999s)]
*  It's one of the baby dragons. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=630.3599999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=631.3599999999999s)]
*  For a fan of the series, it's like visiting a shrine. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=632.3599999999999s)]
*  There are stacks of dummy dead bodies from battles, dragon-head skulls and one of Kit [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=635.04s)]
*  Harrington's most famous costumes, which weighs about 30 pounds. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=639.8399999999999s)]
*  Hold it from that hanger. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=643.7199999999999s)]
*  Gee. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=646.7199999999999s)]
*  I can barely hold this thing. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=647.7199999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=650.68s)]
*  Remember Ned Stark, who lost his head in season one? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=651.68s)]
*  We found it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=655.12s)]
*  We got Ned's head. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=656.12s)]
*  That's Ned's head? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=658.28s)]
*  That's Ned's head. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=659.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=660.28s)]
*  Perhaps the most iconic characters of all in Game of Thrones are White Walkers, supernatural [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=662.4399999999999s)]
*  villains who control an army of zombie-like followers called Whites. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=667.92s)]
*  Much of their look was created at this studio in Kent, England by Barry Gower and his team. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=674.16s)]
*  People say I look like a White Walker all the time. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=679.78s)]
*  I get made fun of all the time. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=683.3s)]
*  Gower agreed to show us just how complex the makeup for White Walkers is. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=685.18s)]
*  Comfortable enough there, yeah. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=689.8199999999999s)]
*  Separate pieces of silicone are painstakingly applied with glue. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=691.9399999999999s)]
*  Then makeup and paint fills in the details. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=695.98s)]
*  The whole process takes about four hours. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=699.14s)]
*  The transformation is startling. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=702.12s)]
*  I keep forgetting that I am dressed like a White Walker. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=704.78s)]
*  You would think you would feel this, but it actually, after a while, it just kind of [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=707.9s)]
*  feels like your regular skin. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=711.9399999999999s)]
*  I think the temperature of the piece is warm up to your body temperature. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=713.68s)]
*  I think it's quite easy to forget that you're wearing something. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=717.34s)]
*  It is like a second skin. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=720.8199999999999s)]
*  Despite all the meticulous attention to detail and careful planning, about halfway through [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=723.1s)]
*  the series, The Thrones executive producers Dan Weiss and David Benioff realized they [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=727.8199999999999s)]
*  had a problem. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=733.3s)]
*  The TV show was catching up to the end of George R.R. Martin's books. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=734.7s)]
*  Martin had promised two more novels to end the story, but he'd missed all his deadlines. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=740.26s)]
*  He told the producers how he thought his books would end, but he didn't have all the details. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=746.0600000000001s)]
*  So for the final seasons, Weiss and Benioff, who produced the TV series from the beginning, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=751.94s)]
*  were on their own to decide how the game ends. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=757.1800000000001s)]
*  What is the feeling as a writer who's dreamed up all these characters, all of a sudden, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=760.86s)]
*  to see it taken in a direction that is not directly of your making? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=766.5s)]
*  Dave and Dan have done the most popular TV show in the world. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=772.46s)]
*  I gave my baby out for adaption, and it's not my baby anymore, but the books are still [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=775.34s)]
*  my baby. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=780.98s)]
*  At the end of last season, Jon Snow and the Mother of Dragons united with some of the [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=781.98s)]
*  leading families in Westeros to try to stop the advancing army of the dead. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=787.46s)]
*  But can humans put aside their differences to save themselves, or will greed and distrust [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=793.46s)]
*  be the end of the Seven Kingdoms? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=799.86s)]
*  I warned you. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=802.4200000000001s)]
*  Northerners don't watch trust outsiders. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=805.7800000000001s)]
*  We can't tell you how it all ends, but this is how the final season begins. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=808.1s)]
*  About a subject the Iraq War, the Hollywood studios were afraid of. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=845.98s)]
*  And yet her movie, The Hurt Locker, is running neck and neck for all the top Oscars with [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=850.9000000000001s)]
*  the biggest grossing movie of all time. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=856.0200000000001s)]
*  It's Mega Bucks Avatar against made-on-a-shoe string Hurt Locker. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=858.94s)]
*  Bigelow was a painter before she was a filmmaker and is still something of a recluse. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=864.34s)]
*  But now she spends a lot of her time walking the red carpet. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=869.58s)]
*  Hurt Locker has already won just about every major critics award, plus Film of the Year [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=873.58s)]
*  from the Producers Guild and Best Director Award from the Directors Guild. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=879.1s)]
*  If she wins the big one, she'll be the first woman ever to win an Oscar for directing. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=884.62s)]
*  Critics say that Catherine Bigelow's Hurt Locker is the best war movie made in years. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=893.5s)]
*  And there's an irony in the fact that it's up against James Cameron's movie. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=898.34s)]
*  How sweet is this to be head to head with your ex-husband? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=902.38s)]
*  Incredible that the two films were made by people who are married to each other. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=908.34s)]
*  You couldn't have scripted it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=913.26s)]
*  There's this whole thing that's going on where people love to, they love to create a headline. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=915.38s)]
*  The Battle of the Exes, you know, War of the Roses. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=919.18s)]

*  Hollywood, she said she and Cameron are now such good friends, they swapped scripts and [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=933.1800000000001s)]

*  He said cut negative. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=945.38s)]
*  What does cut negative? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=946.38s)]
*  Cut negative means you're done editing. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=947.38s)]
*  Cut negative means it's perfect. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=950.7800000000001s)]
*  It was a big compliment. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=953.1800000000001s)]

*  In the Hurt Locker, a riveting two hours filled with fear and violence, Bigelow shows how [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=976.86s)]
*  terrifying it is for a bomb squad in Iraq. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=982.72s)]
*  Butcher shop, two o'clock, dude has a phone. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=985.76s)]

*  Put down the cell phone. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=993.28s)]
*  By using wobbly handheld cameras, Bigelow heightens the tension and the sense of immediacy. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=994.96s)]
*  She wants the audience to feel like the fourth member of the bomb squad. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1001.4s)]
*  The ground just erupts out of nowhere. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1010.2s)]
*  I mean, it's just an incredibly harrowing, dangerous, volatile environment. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1012.24s)]
*  She sees the film both as anti-war and as a tribute to the soldiers who sign up to do [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  this kind of work. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1024.2s)]

*  what you and I and perhaps the rest of the world would run from and they arguably have [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1033.32s)]
*  the most dangerous job in the world, yet they're there by choice. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1039.88s)]
*  They don't know where to look. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1042.4s)]
*  You don't know where to look. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1043.4s)]
*  It's an invisible enemy and you don't know if the man on the third floor balcony is shaking [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1044.4s)]
*  out a rug or calling in a sniper strike. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1048.38s)]

*  Bigelow opens the movie with a quote, the rush of battle is often a potent and lethal [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1058.16s)]
*  addiction for war is a drug. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1063.6000000000001s)]
*  But it's also a sense of meaning and purpose that nothing else in your life can replicate [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1066.64s)]
*  except the battlefield. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1072.2s)]
*  Her main character, Sergeant Will James, can only function when his life is in danger. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1074.1200000000001s)]
*  He's a go-it-alone cowboy who breaks the rules [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1083.0800000000002s)]

*  What's he doing? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1098.84s)]

*  I'm going to die comfortable. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1101.84s)]
*  He's fearless as he looks for bombs and when he diffuses one, he then has to deal with [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1104.84s)]
*  the usual secondaries. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1111.32s)]

*  Oh my. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1117.32s)]
*  It never stops in this movie. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1118.32s)]

*  Without let up. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1130.28s)]
*  She likes to watch and she captures. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1131.6s)]
*  She's a painter. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1134.0s)]
*  Jeremy Renner plays Sergeant James. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1135.24s)]
*  I don't know anybody who has seen this movie who says, I can't believe a woman directed [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1138.0s)]
*  this movie. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1145.2s)]
*  The violence, the machoness. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1147.08s)]
*  What does having a set of ovaries have to do with directing a film? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1150.12s)]
*  It's through her eyes that she sees. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1155.12s)]
*  Not through her memories or anything else that defines her as a woman, right? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1158.8s)]
*  This muscular, somewhat violent world that she's attracted to. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1162.32s)]
*  Do you understand what it is she's drawn to there? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1166.6799999999998s)]
*  I think the idea of war and conflict fascinates her. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1169.28s)]
*  And so it's something that's out there in the world that she's trying to understand. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1174.72s)]
*  I think she also takes pride in the fact that she can outgun the guys. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1178.52s)]
*  You know, that just in pure technique, just pure game. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1183.56s)]
*  She's got more game than most of the male directors out there. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1187.16s)]
*  Bigelow is 58 and The Hurt Locker is her eighth movie. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1190.4s)]
*  And if she has a signature, it's exactly that. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1194.8s)]
*  The concentration on tough guys like Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson in K-19 The Widowmaker. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1198.1599999999999s)]
*  And on daredevils like Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze in Point Break about an FBI agent who [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1205.3999999999999s)]
*  goes after a ring of bank robbers. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1212.04s)]
*  I'm drawn to provocative characters that find themselves in extreme situations. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1214.6s)]
*  And I think I'm drawn to that consistently. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1221.1999999999998s)]
*  She's been drawn to it ever since the early 70s when she was in New York studying painting [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1225.4s)]
*  and one night went to the movies with some friends. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1230.88s)]
*  The film was Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, a Western known as much for its body count [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1234.6000000000001s)]
*  as its art. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1240.4s)]
*  It could be very violent. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1241.4s)]
*  It could be very bloody. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1242.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1243.4s)]
*  Very, very visceral. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1244.4s)]
*  Very, you know, you were just, you were enraptured with this material. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1245.4s)]
*  Enraptured because she realized that unlike painting, film could make you physically feel [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1249.84s)]
*  what the characters in the film were feeling. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1255.6399999999999s)]
*  One of her professors described it as... [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1258.3799999999999s)]
*  Scopophilia. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1261.04s)]
*  Scopophilia? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1262.04s)]
*  Scopophilia, which is the desire to watch and identify with what you're watching. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1263.04s)]
*  Is that when you said, it has to be film? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1270.04s)]
*  I have to make movies? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1273.6s)]
*  It was just, it was like suddenly I had woken up from a drought and there was water in front [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1275.34s)]
*  of me and I was just, I couldn't get enough. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1280.62s)]
*  Watch her at locker and you do feel what the characters feel. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1287.76s)]
*  As in the sniper scene where the unit is pinned down all day long out in the desert. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1293.22s)]
*  The audience feels the fear, the heat and the thirst. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1299.66s)]
*  Bigelow shot the movie almost entirely in Jordan, part of it in this Palestinian refugee [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1307.5400000000002s)]
*  camp. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1313.5s)]
*  And used displaced Iraqis as characters and extras. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1317.8200000000002s)]
*  With a measly $11 million budget, the actors and crew had to take their breaks in Bedouin [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1321.8600000000001s)]
*  No air conditioning for anyone. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1328.22s)]
*  I think what was in our head was to survive any given day. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1330.94s)]
*  I mean you're in the Middle East, you're in the summer, you've got sand storms, wind storms, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1334.5s)]
*  probably an average of 115, 120 degree heat. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1339.66s)]
*  Your lead actor is in a 100 pound bomb suit. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1343.14s)]
*  The cast had other challenges since Bigelow often shot takes with four cameras rolling [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1346.06s)]
*  simultaneously, never telling the actors where the cameras were. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1351.5s)]
*  Anthony Mackie plays Sergeant J.T. Sandborn. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1357.02s)]
*  I've never shot a movie like that before. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1360.1399999999999s)]
*  You always knew where the camera was and had to worry about it. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1361.82s)]
*  What was my good side, where my light was coming from, how should I talk to you. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1364.8999999999999s)]
*  That's how you make movies. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1369.22s)]
*  But this was different. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1370.48s)]
*  This was almost like a documentary. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1371.48s)]
*  And it was guerrilla filmmaking. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1373.6599999999999s)]
*  Bigelow recently held a screening of the film for some real bomb squad veterans. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1376.8999999999999s)]
*  They agree with her about the addiction of war, that the adrenaline rush in what they [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1381.52s)]
*  do creates a craving for more. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1386.12s)]
*  Jim O'Neill, who heads a foundation that helps bomb squad techs, told about one tech [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1389.56s)]
*  who got wounded. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1394.44s)]
*  Lost a leg, got blown up. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1395.44s)]
*  Has lost a leg from the knee down. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1397.8s)]
*  And he's over there in Afghanistan wearing the bomb suit with the prosthetic. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1400.2s)]
*  That's the personality. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1405.2s)]
*  I mean it's an incredible, incredible. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1406.2s)]
*  Brad Somerville worked on a bomb squad in Baghdad. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1408.64s)]
*  After you've been there for a long period of time doing this over and over and going [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1411.5600000000002s)]
*  down range and you come home, there's an empty feeling inside. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1415.8400000000001s)]
*  They think Bigelow nailed it when she showed how difficult it was for Sergeant James to [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1422.8200000000002s)]
*  go home. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1427.24s)]
*  He couldn't relate to his wife. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1428.4s)]
*  You know they need more bomb techs. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1430.68s)]
*  Want to chop those up for me? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1432.68s)]
*  And couldn't even function when he went to the grocery store to buy a box of cereal. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1439.3600000000001s)]
*  The image in the end, the one that I took away the most was at the very end was him [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1445.2s)]
*  walking through the grocery store. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1448.68s)]
*  And that was the one that got me was it was, wow, it's not happening anymore. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1450.5600000000002s)]
*  And I'm back here and it's not real and it's all back there. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1454.64s)]
*  And I can remember seeing him walking down the aisles and his mind going, what do I do [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1458.44s)]
*  now? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1463.72s)]
*  Can we play the clip of when Jeremy talks to his son? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1469.92s)]
*  The older you get, the fewer things you really love. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1473.88s)]
*  By the time you get to my age, maybe it's only one or two things. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1480.32s)]
*  Because me, I think it's one. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1495.96s)]
*  Bigelow ends her movie with Sergeant James leaving his son and going back to the war. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1499.2s)]
*  It was crushing to think he needed that rush, that adrenaline fix so badly he couldn't stay [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1506.48s)]
*  home and take care of his son. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1516.4s)]
*  That comes at a terrible, terrible price for him and he knows it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1518.56s)]
*  But he's incapable of doing anything different. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1524.0s)]
*  Frankly, I thought Catherine was going to get this so I'm kind of winging it here. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1526.16s)]
*  And she richly deserves it. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1531.24s)]
*  Even won at the Golden Globes for Avatar, the only big award Bigelow hasn't won so far. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1534.56s)]
*  And next week is the biggest one, the Oscars. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1541.4s)]
*  If she does win and beats you out. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1544.6s)]
*  You mean when she wins as director. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1547.4s)]
*  Who thinks she's going to win? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1550.2s)]
*  I think it's an irresistible story to finally be able to award the very first directing [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1552.28s)]
*  Oscar to a woman. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1558.32s)]
*  And Catherine, I'm sure she'll be very ambivalent about this because she'll be of the mind, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1560.2s)]
*  wait a minute, I want to win for the work. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1564.16s)]
*  I don't want to win because I'm a woman. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1565.92s)]
*  But I think it's irresistible at the moment of voting, that story. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1568.4s)]
*  Catherine Bigelow will not like hearing that. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1573.4s)]
*  She hates being considered a female director. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1576.48s)]
*  There's really no difference between what I do and what a male filmmaker might do. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1579.8000000000002s)]
*  We all try to make our days, we all try to get the best performances we can, we try to [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1585.1200000000001s)]
*  make our budget, we try to make the best movie we possibly can. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1589.0400000000002s)]
*  So in that sense it's very similar. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1592.52s)]
*  On the other hand, I think the journey for women, no matter what venue it is, politics, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1594.28s)]
*  business, film, it's a long journey. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1601.16s)]
*  Catherine Bigelow gives a lot of credit to the screenwriter Mark Boll, a journalist who [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1605.6000000000001s)]
*  wrote the script after embedding with a bomb squad in Iraq. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1610.88s)]
*  He has also been nominated for an Oscar. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1614.8600000000001s)]
*  With such an acrimonious election, we turn tonight to a man who tells the story of America [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1622.44s)]
*  in all her divisions and struggle for unity. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1631.48s)]
*  Ken Burns' documentaries range from the Civil War to baseball, Vietnam, and last year's [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1635.48s)]
*  country music. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1642.2s)]
*  Burns calls himself an emotional archaeologist. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1643.72s)]
*  He excavates lost love letters, forgotten photos, and overlooked heroes. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1647.24s)]
*  Research so deep, viewers can feel like strangers discovering America for the first time. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1651.96s)]
*  His films ask what it means to be American. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1659.16s)]
*  So we asked, what does it mean to be Ken Burns? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1662.52s)]
*  I have had the privilege of spending my entire life making films about the U.S., capital [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1666.68s)]
*  U, capital S. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1672.84s)]
*  But I've also had the privilege of making films about us, the two-letter, lowercase [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1674.6s)]
*  plural pronoun that has a kind of intimacy and warmth to it. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1680.6s)]
*  In the country music film, Merle Haggard says, country music is about those things we believe [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1685.0s)]
*  in but can't see, like dreams and songs and souls. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1692.1999999999998s)]
*  It's telling us that there is in front of us a kind of rational world in which one and [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1698.76s)]
*  one always equals two, but that the thing that compels us forward as human beings is [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1704.92s)]
*  that we look for one and one equaling three. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1711.16s)]
*  We find that in our faith, we find that in our art, we find that in our love of each [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1714.12s)]
*  other. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1718.84s)]
*  And I think one of the things I discovered working on country music is that when I understood [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1719.4s)]
*  this dynamic between the U.S. and us, lowercase, uppercase, that I realized there's only us, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1725.0s)]
*  no them. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1731.0s)]
*  The choice was easy because... [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1733.0s)]
*  Us. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1735.0s)]
*  The American struggle to forge union from diversity has been Ken Burns' obsession since [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1737.0s)]
*  he was 11 years old at the end of this lane in Ann Arbor, Michigan. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1741.0s)]
*  In 1965, his mother was dying of cancer at the same time as his mother died of cancer. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1747.0s)]
*  At the same time, the fight for equality was in critical condition. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1753.96s)]
*  Before my mom died, I would watch and I would hear from the other room about the dogs and [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1758.2s)]
*  the fire hoses in Selma. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1763.72s)]
*  And it would make me as upset, as upset in my gut as the worry about my mom. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1765.32s)]
*  And it was almost as if I was transposing the cancer that was killing my family and [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1773.16s)]
*  the cancer that was killing my country. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1779.64s)]
*  And if you look at my films, almost 40 of them, you can count on the fingers of one [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1781.24s)]
*  hand the number of films that don't end up dealing with race. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1786.1200000000001s)]
*  His early films included the Statue of Liberty and the Congress. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1790.68s)]
*  But it wasn't until his seventh that America returned Ken Burns' affection. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1794.92s)]
*  The Civil War was seen by 39 million viewers, an 11-hour epic that immortalized a love letter [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1800.92s)]
*  and a waltz. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1813.64s)]
*  The Ashokan Farewell. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1814.92s)]
*  The Fiddle Tune. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1816.52s)]
*  The Fiddle Tune. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1817.48s)]
*  That you can never get out of your head years later. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1818.28s)]
*  The Lament seemed written as a score for the letter Union soldier [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1824.8400000000001s)]
*  Sullivan Ballew wrote his wife a week before his death. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1829.64s)]
*  I shall always be with you in the brightest day and the darkest night. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1834.2s)]
*  Always. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1838.6000000000001s)]
*  Always. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1840.44s)]
*  And when the soft breeze fans your cheek, it shall be my breath or the cool air of [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1843.96s)]
*  your throbbing temple. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1849.96s)]
*  It shall be my spirit passing by. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1851.64s)]
*  I think every man wishes he could say those words to the woman he loves and [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1854.44s)]
*  every woman wishes that her man could say that. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1859.16s)]
*  That may be our shot. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1862.0400000000002s)]
*  Burns' films are a letter to the country he loves, but not out of blind devotion. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1864.28s)]
*  His is the affection that endures after confronting America's founding flaw. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1870.6000000000001s)]
*  We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1877.24s)]
*  Yet he owned more than 200 human beings and never saw fit to free them. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1883.4s)]
*  Burns finds the American paradox in the wars we fight and the games we play. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1891.88s)]
*  I told people that baseball was the sequel to the Civil War and I meant it. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1897.8000000000002s)]
*  I meant it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1902.2s)]
*  How we play games and the nature of immigration and the exclusion of women [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1903.24s)]
*  and popular culture and advertising and heroes and villains in our imagination and race [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1907.8s)]
*  and race and race are who we are. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1914.28s)]
*  And the first real progress in civil rights after the Civil War takes place when Jack [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1919.56s)]
*  Roosevelt Robinson, the grandson of a slave, makes his way to first base at Ebbets Field on [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1927.32s)]
*  April 15, 1947, then there's no question that the story of baseball is just going to take off [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1933.8s)]
*  from the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the failure of reconstruction and move to that moment. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1940.76s)]
*  Ken Burns' moment came in 1981 with his first subject, the Brooklyn Bridge, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1948.9199999999998s)]
*  which no one thought was a good idea. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1954.6s)]
*  Well, you had an inanimate object and no one to interview. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1957.3999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1960.68s)]
*  Great television. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1961.08s)]
*  Yes. And I looked 12 years old so I was out trying to raise money and they'd say, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1961.96s)]
*  this child is trying to sell me the Brooklyn Bridge. No. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1965.72s)]
*  PBS bought the Brooklyn Bridge and Burns structured his style, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1970.92s)]
*  animating images frozen in time and giving them voice. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1976.68s)]
*  Here I was 32 years old suddenly in charge of the most stupendous engineering structure of the age. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1982.68s)]
*  Famous voices volunteer just to be in a Ken Burns film, Meryl Streep as Eleanor Roosevelt. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1989.8s)]
*  Courage is more exhilarating than fear. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=1997.48s)]
*  Tom Hanks in The War. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2002.52s)]
*  You'd never realize now that he was one of those emaciated, tortured souls [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2005.48s)]
*  who survived by some miracle the horror of that death march at Batan. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2010.1999999999998s)]
*  His films have the pace of patient revelation and time to think. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2014.84s)]
*  This is a beautiful part of the country. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2026.28s)]
*  It's the rhythm of a director who lives not in New York or LA, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2028.12s)]
*  but on 50 acres of Walpole, New Hampshire, where even his apples have history. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2032.04s)]
*  Even his apples have history. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2038.84s)]
*  So these are cuttings that were taken from trees at Monticello. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2041.3999999999999s)]
*  Of course they are. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2047.48s)]
*  We met Burns before the pandemic. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2049.7999999999997s)]
*  At 67, he has four daughters from two marriages, but his longest relationship for decades is with PBS. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2052.52s)]
*  I'm fortunate that PBS exists. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2061.88s)]
*  I can go tomorrow to a premium channel or some place streaming service and get [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2065.0s)]
*  30 million dollars to do Vietnam, but no one's going to say you can take 10 and a half years Ken. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2071.24s)]
*  He can take his time because he raises the money and runs his own company, Florentine Films. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2078.36s)]
*  Producers, writers, historians, editors and photographers craft a half dozen films at once, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2085.96s)]
*  so Burns can release about one a year, even though a series like Country Music takes [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2092.6s)]
*  eight years to finish. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2098.44s)]
*  Country Music, the songwriter Harlan Howard said, is three chords and the truth. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2100.68s)]
*  You listened to 15,000 songs, sifted through more than 100,000 still photos, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2108.7599999999998s)]
*  and did 101 on-camera interviews. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2115.72s)]
*  Why so much? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2120.2s)]
*  One would think that making a film is an additive process. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2121.72s)]
*  You're building this. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2126.2s)]
*  It's not. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2127.72s)]
*  It's subtractive. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2128.2799999999997s)]
*  The best metaphor I know of is we make maple syrup here in this town, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2129.64s)]
*  and it takes 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of maple syrup, and that's what the process is. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2136.2s)]
*  Burns has boiled down the history of Mark Twain, the national parks, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2141.8799999999997s)]
*  plus 18 hours on Vietnam and 19 hours of jazz. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2146.68s)]
*  Ken's films touched something at the heart of our mythology, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2151.9599999999996s)]
*  in who we have been, at our best and at our worst, and who we want to be. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2156.9199999999996s)]
*  Composer Wynton Marsalis collaborated on jazz and country music. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2163.3999999999996s)]
*  Marsalis is artistic director of New York's Jazz at Lincoln Center [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2168.04s)]
*  and something of an expert on improvising with Ken Burns. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2172.12s)]
*  He'll be vibrating, and that'll be in the fourth year of something, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2176.4399999999996s)]
*  and it'll be one o'clock in the morning after you've worked since nine o'clock in the morning. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2180.44s)]
*  So now it's one o'clock, so he's still like, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2185.16s)]
*  no, no, right here we need to, right here we need to. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2187.8s)]
*  And to see a person with that type of energy and just on fire like that. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2189.88s)]
*  As he's grown older, it's gotten worse. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2195.32s)]
*  The fire's gotten bigger. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2198.68s)]
*  The fire is just the enthusiasm, fire, the passion. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2199.88s)]
*  Ken told us that you see him. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2204.76s)]
*  So what do you see? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2208.44s)]
*  For me, I always see like a kid, if you can retain that childish [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2210.6s)]
*  awe and wonderment and belief that you can change things, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2216.44s)]
*  if you can maintain that, and that's what I see in him. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2220.28s)]
*  And we found this little tiny place. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2223.88s)]
*  Childish awe and wonderment that somehow survived his childhood. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2225.96s)]
*  Would you say you had a happy childhood? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2230.68s)]
*  I don't think I had a childhood. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2233.56s)]
*  I mean, I did, and I had happy moments, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2235.08s)]
*  but my mother got cancer very early on and that was the shadow [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2238.2799999999997s)]
*  cast across my brother and my childhood. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2242.68s)]
*  We also had a father who was not mentally healthy. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2246.04s)]
*  He was a functioning person, but he was an unhappy man. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2250.04s)]
*  Depression? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2254.7599999999998s)]
*  Depression, maybe bipolar, never accurately diagnosed. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2256.2799999999997s)]
*  Burns was 39 when he realized he was trapped behind the wall he built [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2260.7599999999998s)]
*  to shield himself from his mother's death. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2266.52s)]
*  The revelation came from his father-in-law. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2269.48s)]
*  And he said, I bet you blew out your candles as a child, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2272.52s)]
*  as a boy wishing she'd come back. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2275.88s)]
*  I said, yeah, how you know? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2277.8s)]
*  And he goes, look what you do for a living. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2279.64s)]
*  You wake the dead. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2282.2s)]
*  You make Abraham Lincoln and Jackie Robinson come alive. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2283.96s)]
*  Who do you think you really want to wake up? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2286.7599999999998s)]
*  So I called my brother and we wept and we said we have to find mommy. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2290.12s)]
*  They had to find her because she'd been buried in an unmarked [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2295.32s)]
*  popper's grave with 28 souls simply because Burns' father [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2299.48s)]
*  never retrieved her ashes from the funeral home. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2304.52s)]
*  It's a long and complicated story. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2307.88s)]
*  Like researching a story, Ken and his filmmaker brother Rick [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2310.04s)]
*  tracked their history to the mass grave where they placed a memorial to Lila Burns. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2314.6s)]
*  The ability to say to the world, this is us, wouldn't have been possible without the crucible [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2320.12s)]
*  of her sickness, her death, and even that long wilderness of not dealing with it. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2331.16s)]
*  And dealing with it, I think, has made me a better filmmaker. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2339.4s)]
*  A filmmaker working through the chapters of a single subject [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2344.52s)]
*  because Burns found, as Walt Whitman wrote, these states are the ampulist poem. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2348.6s)]
*  I am working on seven films right now. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2355.32s)]
*  I mean, we got Ernest Hemingway, we have Muhammad Ali, we have Benjamin Franklin, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2357.56s)]
*  we have LBJ biographies. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2362.28s)]
*  We're doing a history of the American Revolution and a biography of the buffalo. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2363.96s)]
*  They are together the story of a people straining for union, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2368.44s)]
*  a theme Ken Burns has explored from his very first film, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2372.52s)]
*  which was, after all, about a bridge connecting America to America. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2376.76s)]
*  This is what stories do. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2382.76s)]
*  They do liberate us from the tyrannies of our limitations and our past and our foibles. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2384.44s)]
*  And so this is what we human beings do to negotiate this all too short passage that we call life. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2394.44s)]
*  And I am so grateful that I live in the United States of America. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2403.4s)]
*  I mean that. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2408.6s)]
*  I mean that. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2409.96s)]
*  And that I get to tell stories about us, the U.S. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2411.56s)]
*  What filmmaker has had five movies open number one at the box office in the last four years? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2427.64s)]
*  Spielberg, Tarantino, Scorsese? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2432.76s)]
*  No. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2435.8s)]
*  This record belongs to Tyler Perry, one of the biggest names in the movie business. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2436.6000000000004s)]
*  Yet most Americans have never heard of him. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2441.1600000000003s)]
*  His eight films have grossed more than $418 million, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2443.6400000000003s)]
*  one of the highest average grosses per film in the industry. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2447.96s)]
*  And they're just part of Perry's multi-million dollar entertainment empire. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2451.1600000000003s)]
*  What's made Tyler Perry guarantee box office gold is his devoted audience, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2455.2400000000002s)]
*  largely African-American, church going, working class and female. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2460.12s)]
*  Long ignored by Hollywood, they come to see something they can't get anywhere else. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2464.44s)]
*  Inspirational stories about people like themselves and to laugh at characters like this. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2468.7599999999998s)]
*  Go in that room and take your medicine. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2475.32s)]
*  You know you crazy as hell when you don't take it. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2477.16s)]
*  The gun toting, wise cracking grandmother played by Tyler Perry himself, Medea. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2479.24s)]
*  My soul cries out hallelujah. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2486.6s)]
*  Thank God for saving me. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2488.76s)]
*  Medea is a cross between my mother and my aunt. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2491.8s)]
*  She's the type of grandmother that was on every corner when I was growing up. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2493.96s)]
*  She smoked, she walked out of the house with her curlers and a moomo and she watched everybody's [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2499.0s)]
*  kids. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2502.92s)]
*  She didn't take no crap. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2503.0800000000004s)]
*  She's a strong figure in where I come from, in my part of the African-American community. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2504.36s)]
*  And I say that because I'm sure that there are some other parts of the African-American [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2511.8s)]
*  community that may be looking at me now going, who does he think he's speaking off? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2516.44s)]
*  But for me, this woman was very, very, very, very visible. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2521.2400000000002s)]
*  That's what Tyler Perry's work is all about. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2528.28s)]
*  Reflecting a world his audience relates to and they show up in drones. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2530.84s)]
*  You heard of the horse whisperer? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2535.8s)]
*  I'm the kid whisperer. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2537.4s)]
*  It's been written that Medea is one of the top 10 grossing women actresses in the country. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2539.96s)]
*  They weren't serious when they wrote that. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2547.0s)]
*  Come on, come on. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2549.96s)]
*  But Medea's done well. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2551.7200000000003s)]
*  She's done well by you. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2553.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, she has. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2555.16s)]
*  She has. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2556.12s)]
*  So have his other popular characters like the flamboyant Mr. Brown. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2557.16s)]
*  I'm Leroy Brown. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2561.4s)]
*  My friends call me Leroy Brown. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2563.4s)]
*  You can just call me Leroy Brown. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2565.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, how you know? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2567.16s)]
*  But it's not just comedy. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2569.0s)]
*  Perry's work is a gumbo of melodrama, social commentary and inspiration. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2570.6s)]
*  You got the strength God gave us women to survive. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2576.44s)]
*  You just ain't tapped into it yet. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2581.8s)]
*  It's a formula, one that intentionally targets women. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2583.88s)]
*  You're always going to see a person of faith. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2587.4s)]
*  Nine times out of ten there'll be a woman who has problems, who has lost faith or lost her way. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2590.04s)]
*  There's always going to be a moment of redemption somewhere for someone. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2594.84s)]
*  And then there are the grittier, darker elements, the violence, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2600.52s)]
*  especially directed at women and children, sex and child abuse, prostitution and drug use. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2603.96s)]
*  But there's always a fairy tale ending, a happy marriage, a reconciliation, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2610.36s)]
*  often delivered with a dose of gospel music. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2616.36s)]
*  Although Perry's themes are universal, he's not widely known outside of his niche audience. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2622.28s)]
*  The average American has no idea who you are. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2627.88s)]
*  Now how is it possible? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2630.2s)]
*  I'll tell you how it's possible. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2631.08s)]
*  There's this great thing called the Chitlin circuit, which I started my shows on. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2633.3199999999997s)]
*  And back in the day when Ray Charles and Billie Holiday and Duke Ellington, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2636.92s)]
*  they couldn't get into White Establishment, so they went on this circuit and toured. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2641.96s)]
*  They were huge stars in their own community. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2646.04s)]
*  And that's pretty much my same story. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2648.92s)]
*  I was able to build and have this amazing career among my own people, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2651.7999999999997s)]
*  but outside of that not a lot of people knew who I was. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2656.2s)]
*  Tyler Perry, superstar of the Chitlin circuit. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2659.16s)]
*  Yeah, superstar of the Chitlin circuit. I'll take that. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2662.6s)]
*  You realize what a superstar he is and how strongly the audience connects to him [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2667.7999999999997s)]
*  when he appears on stage after a performance of one of his plays. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2672.44s)]
*  Their reaction gives you a sense of how passionate they are about it. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2677.16s)]
*  But he didn't always get this kind of reaction. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2685.8799999999997s)]
*  He got a start in theater, writing, directing and producing plays. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2688.92s)]
*  His first production, a gospel musical staged in Atlanta in 1992, bombed. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2692.92s)]
*  But he kept writing and staging new plays, cultivating his audience. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2698.12s)]
*  By the late 90s, they were selling out across the country, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2702.36s)]
*  making big money, more than $75 million. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2705.08s)]
*  Perry's goal? Turn those shows into movies. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2708.6s)]
*  Hollywood's reaction? Get lost. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2711.8s)]
*  They didn't open the door. I had to cut a hole in the window to get in. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2714.28s)]
*  That's what you did? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2718.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, man. If you close the door on me and tell me I can't, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2719.24s)]
*  I'm gonna find a way to get in. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2721.96s)]
*  He found his way in by setting up shop in Atlanta in 2004, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2724.52s)]
*  where he made his first film, Diary of a Mad Black Woman, using his own money. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2728.92s)]
*  He who has the goal makes the rules. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2733.96s)]
*  If somebody else is going to give you the money, then they're going to be in control. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2737.08s)]
*  They're going to own it, they're going to tell you how it goes, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2740.2799999999997s)]
*  they're going to give you notes and give you changes. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2742.04s)]
*  I wasn't willing to do that, so there was no other option for me. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2743.56s)]
*  Diary debuted at number one in 2005, stunning Hollywood. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2747.08s)]
*  Perry's been surprising Hollywood ever since, doing it his way. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2751.56s)]
*  He writes, directs and produces his movies, and all eight of them have been major hits, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2755.7999999999997s)]
*  including his latest, I Can Do Bad All By Myself, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2760.2s)]
*  which opened number one of the box office in September. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2763.4s)]
*  This is your dream? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2767.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2768.44s)]
*  Yeah. One of them. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2769.16s)]
*  One of them. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2771.0s)]
*  This is Tyler Perry Studios. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2772.04s)]
*  31 acres of movie and television production facilities, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2774.36s)]
*  one of the largest independently-owned studios outside of Hollywood. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2778.36s)]
*  It opened last October, financed by Perry himself, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2782.44s)]
*  with the profits he's made from his productions. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2785.7200000000003s)]
*  It's Perry's multi-million dollar magic kingdom. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2788.36s)]
*  This is the back lot, and I named it 34th Street as in Miracle on 34th Street. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2791.96s)]
*  He makes all of his films here, releasing two a year, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2796.92s)]
*  and he employs as many as 400 people. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2800.44s)]
*  That's the Cecilie Tyson stage next to it. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2802.84s)]
*  It has five sound stages, a gym, even a chapel. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2804.76s)]
*  This is a wardrobe. There's Madea. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2808.36s)]
*  Where? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2810.36s)]
*  Up there. That's all Madea. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2810.84s)]
*  That's where she lives between movies. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2814.44s)]
*  When he's not making movies, this relentless multitasker is running his two hit sitcoms on TBS, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2818.92s)]
*  House of Pain and Meet the Browns. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2825.32s)]
*  Hit him hard. Hit him hard, really. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2827.56s)]
*  He has total creative control and owns everything he makes. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2829.32s)]
*  And we cut. Very good. Thanks a lot. I'm out of here. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2833.6400000000003s)]
*  Tyler Perry's huge success has brought him power and even comparisons to Oprah, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2837.96s)]
*  his friend and mentor. They've teamed up to executive produce Precious, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2842.6000000000004s)]
*  a film about an urban teenage mother battling abuse and illiteracy, which opens in November. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2846.84s)]
*  Do not play him small because he is not just some lucky, rich, Negro-turned-black man. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2851.96s)]
*  He is not. To be able to take what he saw as an opportunity to reach a group of people and to [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2861.16s)]
*  turn that into this multi-million, soon-to-be multi-billion-dollar enterprise is what everybody [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2870.92s)]
*  else is trying to do. What's the connection you think Tyler Perry has with African American women? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2880.84s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think he grew up being raised by strong black women. And so much of what he does [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2885.6400000000003s)]
*  is really in celebration of that. I think that's what Madea really is, a compilation of [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2891.96s)]
*  all those strong black women that I know. And maybe you do too. And so the reason it works [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2899.8s)]
*  is because people see themselves. This is my universe. Perry says he's writing what he knows, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2907.96s)]
*  writing where he comes from. He grew up working class in this tough New Orleans neighborhood. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2916.04s)]
*  And my heart is racing just being here. Isn't that crazy? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2922.28s)]
*  Why? I don't have good memories here at all. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2926.12s)]
*  But it's those memories, both good and bad, that have inspired much of his work. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2930.28s)]
*  Mr. James is still sitting on the porch. He's watching everything. You know that boy was over [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2935.4s)]
*  there with that girl last night. That sounds like one of your characters. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2940.44s)]
*  Yeah, man, listen, are you kidding me? We met two neighbors who reminded us an [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2945.48s)]
*  awful lot of a certain grandmother. These are the kind of women I grew up with. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2949.8s)]
*  Oh yes, and Christian women, Christian women. Christian women with guns. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2953.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, people wonder where Madea came from. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2957.08s)]
*  We crossed the street to where he used to live and the pain of his past came back. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2962.12s)]
*  This is where I grew up and I have not been in this house in years. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2966.52s)]
*  In this house, Perry says his father Emmett repeatedly beat him and his mother Maxine. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2970.92s)]
*  He described one time when his father whipped him with a cord until the skin came off his back [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2976.68s)]
*  and told us when his father wasn't beating him, he was belittling him. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2982.2s)]
*  Your father used to warn your mother about you. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2986.36s)]
*  Yeah, one day I would make her cry because she would try to protect me from him. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2989.0s)]
*  What the f*** are you protecting him for? What are you protecting him for? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2994.52s)]
*  This boy ain't gonna be one day gonna make you cry. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=2997.6400000000003s)]
*  He brought us out back, showed us the cubby hole where he would escape from his father's abuse. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3002.52s)]
*  This is my hideout, my safe place, you know. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3007.8s)]
*  When you got too much, you going here? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3012.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I've spent like all day in there. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3014.36s)]
*  So I had a door there so I could go in and [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3016.84s)]
*  and close myself up, you know, to be okay for a minute. Yeah. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3023.8s)]
*  Your father, it sounds like, still makes you, can still make you feel like that boy, little boy. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3030.6s)]
*  Now how is it possible? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3035.96s)]
*  You'd have to walk that road and be that little boy. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3037.8s)]
*  A lot of it I've put out of my mind because it was so horrific and so painful that had I not, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3040.92s)]
*  and that's where my imagination was born, that he was losing it and saying all those things. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3049.56s)]
*  I could absolutely be there in that room with him at the top of his lungs and go somewhere else in [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3054.2000000000003s)]
*  my head. His faith and his mother, he says, saved him. Sunday morning she'd take me to church [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3060.52s)]
*  and this is the only time I saw her smiling happy. So I wanted to know the God, this Christ that made [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3066.6800000000003s)]
*  my mother smile so much. Perry says he's forgiven his father and come to terms with the abuse. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3071.7200000000003s)]
*  This is what happens. You let it destroy you or you take it and you use it. I chose to use it and I [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3078.12s)]
*  chose to put in my work and I choose to to have it touch and make people understand it. Yet there [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3083.8s)]
*  are some who don't understand Perry's work and dismiss it, many of them African Americans. They [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3089.6400000000003s)]
*  find characters like Madea, Mr. Brown, demeaning caricatures, racial stereotypes. Spike Lee has [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3095.16s)]
*  said and I quote, I think there's a lot of stuff out today that is coonery and buffoonery. I see [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lKHKzfPWE8&t=3101.56s)]
