*  I've met people of every political persuasion here [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=255.52s)]
*  from like far left Democrats who are for [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=258.4s)]

*  have different dorms for different student groups. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=291.32s)]
*  I didn't want to go to a space that was like that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=293.7s)]
*  Why do you think it's important to be at a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=296.2s)]
*  college where differing views aren't just [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=297.86s)]
*  accepted and tolerated but welcome? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=301.94s)]
*  We're actually listening to the other side and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=304.78s)]
*  understanding each other and still we're friends [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=306.78s)]
*  with each other. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=307.8s)]

*  I don't want to... [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=314.58s)]
*  That's like what? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=315.58s)]
*  I still belong pretty well and it's a beautiful [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=316.58s)]
*  thing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=319.32s)]
*  Not exactly the vibe on so many other campuses. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=320.42s)]
*  Long before Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=325.92s)]
*  colleges have been sites of protest and have leaned [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=330.32s)]
*  left. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=333.2s)]
*  But the atmosphere has intensified over the past [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=335.2s)]
*  decade. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=337.6s)]

*  the $2 the workers actually got. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1265.0600000000002s)]
*  Though Sama says that's a fair wage for the region. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1267.96s)]
*  If the big tech companies are going to keep doing [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1271.66s)]
*  this business, they have to do it the right way. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1274.9s)]
*  So it's not because you realize Kenya is a [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1277.7s)]

*  Kenya, $2 is enough for you. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1284.16s)]
*  That idea has to end. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1285.72s)]
*  Okay, $2 an hour in Kenya. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1287.26s)]
*  Is that low, medium, is it an okay salary? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1290.46s)]

*  I have saved nothing because it's not enough. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1298.0s)]

*  Lowriders are all about that, right? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1964.1799999999998s)]
*  The car amongst cars, they're going to be the one that pops. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1965.8999999999999s)]

*  II. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1984.38s)]
*  You had many Mexican Americans going into the Army and then coming back and still being [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1985.38s)]

*  And so a lot of those people basically created this counterculture to be able to speak back [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1992.48s)]
*  and say, we belong here too. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=1998.22s)]

*  It's sort of like embracing the American-ness, the car culture, but making it your own and [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2006.34s)]
*  saying I'm part of America, but I'm not part of this mainstream. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2011.56s)]

*  Vanderslice started painting lowriders in the late 1980s. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2091.2400000000002s)]
*  That's just about when gangster rap artists popularized the cars in music videos. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2098.04s)]
*  That contributed to a public impression of lowriders as connected to gangs and drugs. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2105.7200000000003s)]

*  Right, right. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2163.46s)]
*  That's a big leap. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2164.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's a huge leap. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2165.46s)]
*  In the lowriders leap, Patricia Trujillo remembers a particular pivot. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2167.12s)]
*  In the plaza in Santa Fe, lowriding had been banned for many years. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2172.7999999999997s)]
*  Santa Fe is the capital of New Mexico and its artistic center. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2179.36s)]
*  So when the city's mayor not only dropped the ban on cruising, but declared a lowrider [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2184.04s)]
*  In 2016, Trujillo says cars slow rolled in by the hundreds. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2192.14s)]
*  There was this real shift in culture in that moment of recognizing lowriders as an important [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2198.8999999999996s)]
*  part of our heritage, an important part of the artistry of our communities. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2204.1s)]
*  And I really feel like that marked a new moment in New Mexico. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2210.3799999999997s)]
*  So we're all a family. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2213.9799999999996s)]

*  Is your car making a statement? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2268.3799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2270.4599999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2271.4599999999996s)]
*  And what's that statement? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2272.4599999999996s)]
*  It's our fishing net. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2273.72s)]
*  Wherever we take our cars, people are drawn to his artwork. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2275.24s)]
*  People are drawn to what we've done to the cars and who we are and people know us from [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2278.8399999999997s)]
*  all over. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2283.16s)]
*  So it draws people in. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2284.16s)]
*  It draws people. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2285.16s)]

*  In the past, words associated with lowriders were gangs, drugs and crime. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2299.62s)]

*  So what's the definition of rebellion now? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2349.0400000000004s)]
*  Rebellion now is healing to be that beacon of hope, right? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2352.6800000000003s)]
*  Espanola needs hope. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2357.54s)]

*  How does that help with the at-risk kids? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2398.36s)]
*  First of all, it gives them an opportunity to say, hey, I got to get to the Teen Center [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2402.12s)]
*  after school every Wednesday. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2405.56s)]

*  as the planner, they do it all. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhrNFVmwHk&t=2415.76s)]
