*  Denzel Washington has decided to focus on a project [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  that's more important to him than any work he's done, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=28.9s)]
*  bringing to the screen the works of one of America's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=32.5s)]
*  greatest playwrights, the late August Wilson, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=35.1s)]
*  winner of two Pulitzer Prizes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=38.3s)]

*  I understand that you made it clear to everybody on the set [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=67.6s)]
*  that you're not after good, you're after great, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=71.1s)]
*  and that anybody who's coming to work on this film [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=74.0s)]
*  has to want great. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=77.2s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=79.1s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=80.2s)]
*  Well, the best you can be. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=81.5s)]
*  Joy, you ought to stop that line. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=83.2s)]
*  Fences is set in Pittsburgh in the 1950s and 60s [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=84.9s)]
*  when racial integration was just gaining a toehold. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=89.0s)]
*  He ain't said nothing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=92.0s)]
*  He told me to go down to the commissioner's office [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=93.0s)]
*  next Friday. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=94.2s)]
*  Washington plays 53-year-old Troy Maxson, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=95.2s)]
*  whose life is defined by his big personality [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=98.4s)]
*  and his bigger disappointments. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=101.9s)]
*  Why me? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  Because I asked a question. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  That's all I did. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=105.7s)]
*  He is a garbage man who had great ability to play baseball, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  but he came along at a time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  Blacks weren't accepted yet in the big leagues, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=114.3s)]
*  so he was frustrated by that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=116.6s)]
*  Anybody can drive a truck. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  How come you got all the whites driving and colored lip? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=119.7s)]
*  Washington filmed Fences in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=123.6s)]
*  a once vibrant black neighborhood [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=127.3s)]
*  where August Wilson grew up. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=129.2s)]
*  The people who went to work and to church [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=131.6s)]
*  and raised their families here inspired many of his plays. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=134.1s)]
*  It's a Pittsburgh story, and I want it to be in Pittsburgh. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=138.3s)]
*  The stories I get from people, all of that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=141.9s)]
*  helps to feed the film. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=143.9s)]
*  Washington turned this vacant Hill District house [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  into the Maxson family home, familiar to many of us [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=148.8s)]
*  who grew up in a black working class neighborhood at the time. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  I swear I know this house. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=157.1s)]
*  Now, OK, now you tell me. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=158.8s)]
*  My aunt lived in this house. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=161.1s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=162.3s)]
*  The front room and the? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=163.1s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  The parlor. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=165.0s)]
*  The parlor? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=165.8s)]
*  I'll take you for the tour. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=166.9s)]
*  This is the dining room. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=167.9s)]
*  The dining room. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=168.8s)]
*  And this? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=169.8s)]
*  Is it? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=170.6s)]
*  You got Jesus, my little thing? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  In the 60s, this was in every African-American house. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=172.7s)]
*  You know I had to put that in there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=176.0s)]
*  You know I put that in there. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=177.7s)]
*  Every African-American house. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=179.1s)]
*  And they ought to be felt. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=180.7s)]
*  You know, that black or whatever, that felt stuff, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=182.5s)]
*  Of course. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=185.2s)]
*  You got Jesus, Martin Luther King, and John F. Kennedy, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=186.1s)]
*  and her baby. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=189.2s)]
*  So you notice you don't have no pictures of Troy up there. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=190.1s)]
*  That's terrible, actually. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=192.6s)]
*  This is the backyard. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=194.29999999999998s)]
*  The action takes place right out here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=195.7s)]
*  What are y'all out here getting into? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=197.7s)]
*  You worried about what we getting into for a woman? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=199.7s)]
*  Fences is the story of a family unraveling. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=201.7s)]
*  Troy, from his wife, Rose, and from his son, Cory. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  Look, boy, the white man ain't going to let you get nowhere [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  with no football, no way. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=213.7s)]
*  Now, you get your book learning so you can work your way up [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=215.29999999999998s)]
*  at the A&P and learn how to fix cars or build houses. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  He'll get you a trade. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  This way you got something, can't nobody take away from you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  Do you see your father in Troy? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=224.89999999999998s)]
*  In some regards, he couldn't read well. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=228.5s)]
*  He had the same conversation with me [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=232.4s)]
*  about getting a good trade. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=234.9s)]
*  He worked for the water department in New York. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=236.6s)]
*  And he could get me on at the water department. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=239.0s)]
*  And he said, I could be a supervisor in 25 years. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  He's like, you get a good job, you get a trade. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=245.1s)]
*  You get a secure job. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=246.6s)]
*  Yeah, a secure job, exactly. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=247.5s)]
*  And like Rose, my mother could see further. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=249.1s)]
*  No, he's got to get an education, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=254.1s)]
*  he's got to go to college. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=255.5s)]
*  And he couldn't see that far. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=258.0s)]
*  Times have changed, Troy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=259.2s)]
*  People change. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=261.8s)]
*  The world changed and then you can't even see it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=263.9s)]
*  Woman, I do the best I can do. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=272.7s)]
*  I come in here every Friday, I carry a sack of potatoes [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=275.5s)]
*  and a bucket of lard. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=278.4s)]
*  You all line up at the door with your hands out. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=279.6s)]
*  I give you the lint from my pockets, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=283.5s)]
*  I give you my sweat and my blood. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=285.2s)]
*  I ain't got no tears, I done spent them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=287.1s)]
*  We go upstairs in that room at night, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=289.70000000000005s)]
*  I fall down on you and try to blast the hole into forever. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=291.1s)]
*  I get up Monday morning, find my lunch on the table, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=296.20000000000005s)]
*  go out and make my way, find my strength [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=298.3s)]
*  to get me through the next Friday. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=300.6s)]
*  That's all I got, Rose. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=304.5s)]
*  I remember seeing my father in the driveway [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=306.70000000000005s)]
*  listening to the ball game. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=310.1s)]
*  I remember the door would be open, he had his foot out [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=312.5s)]
*  and he's just listening to the ball game. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=315.0s)]
*  And I realized, as when I got older, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=316.6s)]
*  it was the only place where he had a chance to, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=320.5s)]
*  he just dealt with one boss, now he's about to go [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=323.0s)]
*  in the house and my mother's in there, the other boss, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=326.0s)]
*  and he had maybe 10 minutes to himself to be the boss. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=328.5s)]
*  In the driveway. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  In the driveway. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=333.0s)]
*  Listening to the ball game. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=333.70000000000005s)]

*  He is known in Hollywood [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=657.26s)]
*  for his almost obsessive preparation [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=658.5s)]
*  and attention to detail. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=660.76s)]
*  He says it helps him disappear into his roles. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=662.66s)]
*  Malcolm X, he kind of looked like him. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=666.36s)]
*  Actually, I don't. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=668.12s)]
*  I know you don't, but in the movie, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=668.96s)]
*  you convince people that you look like Malcolm X. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=670.86s)]
*  When you have a powder keg [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=673.92s)]
*  and there's too many sparks around it, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=675.0s)]
*  the thing's going to explode. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=676.66s)]
*  It's what I do. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=678.2s)]
*  That's what you do. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=679.36s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=680.2s)]
*  And with Ruben Hurricane Carter, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=681.02s)]
*  I understand you train with boxing. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=682.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=684.62s)]
*  In a movie, the shots have to be short [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=685.7s)]
*  and you have to fake it and do all that kind of stuff. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=687.66s)]
*  You were faking it? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=689.76s)]
*  Not the body shots. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=690.8199999999999s)]
*  All the body shots were real. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=691.66s)]
*  So you were getting punched? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=693.02s)]
*  And I was punching. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=694.36s)]
*  Doesn't hurt as long as you're getting a few shots off. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=696.06s)]
*  Training day. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=700.18s)]
*  Today's a training day, Officer Hoy. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=701.52s)]
*  I did a lot of work with the LAPD. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=703.22s)]
*  I found out how dangerous it was. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=705.42s)]
*  You got today and today only to show me who [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=707.06s)]
*  and what you're made of. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=709.8199999999999s)]
*  You hear me? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=710.66s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=711.68s)]
*  My nigga. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=713.76s)]
*  He was tough. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=715.86s)]
*  Alonzo was just wicked, just evil. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=716.82s)]
*  You hear often that black actors, black movies [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=720.0200000000001s)]
*  don't play well overseas. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=724.82s)]
*  Is that the truth or is that an excuse? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=727.46s)]
*  I've heard everything. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=731.62s)]
*  And what I hear keeps changing [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=734.2800000000001s)]
*  because they used to say it didn't sell over here. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=736.62s)]
*  Then it does. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=739.6600000000001s)]
*  Then they say it doesn't sell in the South. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=741.0200000000001s)]
*  Then it does. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=743.7800000000001s)]
*  Well, it doesn't sell in Europe. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=744.86s)]
*  And it does. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=746.82s)]
*  So I just keep pushing. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=747.76s)]
*  Well, what an opportunity I have to prove them wrong. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=749.66s)]
*  And he has. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=753.22s)]
*  Becoming one of Hollywood's most bankable stars, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=754.7s)]
*  he's favored to get a seventh Oscar nomination for Fences. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=757.82s)]
*  This is all happening at a time [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=761.5600000000001s)]
*  when the Oscars are being criticized for lack of diversity. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=763.02s)]
*  I'm just wondering, what do you think about that? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=766.16s)]
*  I don't have to think about it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  I've lived it. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=769.86s)]
*  I've been the guy at the Oscars [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=771.4200000000001s)]
*  without my name being called. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=773.3199999999999s)]
*  I've been the guy at the Oscars when my name is called. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=775.76s)]
*  I've been the guy at the Oscars [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=778.52s)]
*  when everybody thought they was gonna call my name [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=779.66s)]
*  and they didn't. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=781.42s)]
*  So I've lived it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=782.26s)]
*  So what would you say to the people [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=783.36s)]
*  who are looking at this process and saying it's unfair? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=785.3s)]
*  Yeah, and so what? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=789.46s)]
*  We will give up. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=792.22s)]
*  If you're looking for an excuse, you will find one. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=793.76s)]
*  In race. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=796.86s)]
*  You can find it wherever you like. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=797.8199999999999s)]
*  You can't live like that. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=800.5s)]
*  Just do the best you can do. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=801.7s)]
*  So what's next? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=802.9s)]
*  I mean, are you enjoying this directing? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=803.74s)]
*  I won't be directing anytime soon. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=806.5s)]
*  You will not be? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=808.1s)]
*  No. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=808.9399999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=810.26s)]
*  Going back to the acting? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=811.1s)]
*  What's your first name? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=812.3s)]
*  Bill. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=814.14s)]
*  Right, put an S on it. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=814.9599999999999s)]
*  Gotta pay a couple of them. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=816.74s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=817.6999999999999s)]
*  Acting pays the bills. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=819.54s)]
*  Acting pays the bills. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=820.66s)]
*  Do what you gotta do [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=822.56s)]
*  so that you can do what you wanna do. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=823.6s)]
*  I've just done what I wanted to do. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=825.16s)]
*  Now I gotta get back to what I gotta do. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=828.14s)]
*  Ken, I'm going to call you back. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=830.7s)]
*  Bye. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=832.74s)]
*  Will I see you in a minute? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=833.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm back. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=835.44s)]
*  Of all the actors that have passed through Hollywood, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=840.96s)]
*  very few, if any, have had a career like Bryan Cranston. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=843.94s)]
*  He knocked around Tinseltown for decades [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=848.14s)]
*  before finally landing his first leading role [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=850.6s)]
*  at 50, Walter White on Breaking Bad, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=853.6s)]
*  a very tough act to follow. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=857.0s)]
*  But since then, thanks for Cranston had been breaking good. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=859.16s)]
*  He won a Tony Award on Broadway, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=862.4s)]
*  an Oscar nomination in Hollywood, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=864.56s)]
*  all while writing his memoir. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=866.64s)]
*  It's testimony to his talent, patience, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=868.92s)]
*  perseverance, and luck. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=871.56s)]
*  Brian, Brian! [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=874.1999999999999s)]
*  Brian Cranston was born and raised in Los Angeles [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=875.9599999999999s)]
*  and had been a familiar face here for decades, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=879.0s)]
*  but never a star. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=881.76s)]
*  That officially changed three years ago [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=883.8s)]
*  when the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=886.48s)]
*  embedded his name in a sidewalk. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=888.64s)]
*  I have often walked down this street before. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=890.6s)]
*  But the pavement never held my star before. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=896.16s)]
*  All at once I'm three stories high [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=900.4s)]
*  knowing I'm on the street where it lives. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=904.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=908.04s)]
*  Since then, it's only gotten better. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=909.3199999999999s)]
*  At age 60, he is on Hollywood's A-list [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=911.6s)]
*  in a red carpet regular, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=914.24s)]
*  and no one was more surprised than Cranston. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=916.04s)]
*  I didn't feel entitled to become a star. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=919.04s)]
*  I didn't expect it. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=922.44s)]
*  Did you want it? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=924.32s)]
*  Not really. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=925.64s)]
*  The things you want professionally are opportunities, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=926.84s)]
*  and through my good fortune, that's what's happened. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=930.48s)]
*  Opportunity has come to me. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=933.48s)]
*  And when it came late in his career, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=937.52s)]
*  Cranston knocked it out of the park. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=939.84s)]
*  Maybe you and I could partner up. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=942.16s)]
*  You want to cook crystal meth? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=944.4399999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=946.72s)]
*  When we first started, we were just telling a story [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=948.0s)]
*  and trying to do our best, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=950.28s)]
*  and it just started to steamroll and became this juggernaut. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=951.6s)]
*  Did you see it coming? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=955.48s)]
*  No. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=956.4399999999999s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=958.16s)]
*  It's a familiar story now. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=959.64s)]
*  A meek and depressed high school chemistry teacher [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=961.3199999999999s)]
*  with terminal cancer cooks up a scheme [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=964.0s)]
*  to make and market a superior grade of methamphetamine [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=966.76s)]
*  to provide a nest egg for his family after he's gone. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=970.88s)]
*  But over the course of five seasons, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=974.52s)]
*  Walter White goes from milk toast to murderous [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=976.68s)]
*  in order to survive. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=979.64s)]
*  I was just infused with ideas, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=982.0s)]
*  and I would dream about it and wake up and go, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=984.52s)]
*  oh, I have another idea about Walter White. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=986.4s)]
*  You clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me... [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=989.0799999999999s)]
*  It was so well written, and it just got into my soul. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=992.12s)]
*  I am the danger. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=995.16s)]
*  It was Cranston's first real opportunity [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=997.88s)]
*  to show what he could do as an actor. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1000.3199999999999s)]
*  Run. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1002.4s)]
*  The result was new respect in a closet full of Emmys. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1003.9599999999999s)]
*  When the show finally ended, he saw it as a new beginning [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1007.56s)]
*  and an opportunity to try something completely different. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1010.9599999999999s)]
*  It had been years since Cranston had performed on stage, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1015.0s)]
*  yet he decided to sign on with a theater company in Boston [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1018.28s)]
*  that was doing a new play called All the Way [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1021.92s)]
*  about Lyndon Johnson, a very complicated character. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1024.56s)]
*  It had to be an amazing challenge. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1028.28s)]
*  I mean, why did you do it? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1030.6s)]
*  He was Shakespearean in size, and I thought, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1032.2s)]
*  ooh, boy, that's a big bite to take, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1035.48s)]
*  and it scares me a little bit, so let's do it. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1038.28s)]
*  And there were reasons to be scared. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1042.3200000000002s)]
*  I realized, oh my God, this is an enormous play, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1044.44s)]
*  and it's almost all me, big, big chunks of speeches, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1048.2s)]
*  speeches, speeches, and I started to panic. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1052.1200000000001s)]
*  It is all or nothing. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1054.72s)]
*  But in Boston and later on Broadway, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1057.3600000000001s)]
*  and after that, a film version for HBO, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1060.24s)]
*  his performance was so on the mark. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1063.3600000000001s)]
*  Let us begin. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1065.3600000000001s)]
*  You had to remind yourself it was Cranston and not Johnson. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1067.28s)]
*  I love you more than my own daddy. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1071.1200000000001s)]
*  But if you get in my way, I'll crush you. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1078.64s)]
*  Look at that, look at that, look at those sizes there. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1084.48s)]
*  After winning a Tony Award, Broadway's highest honor, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1088.28s)]
*  he topped it off with an Oscar-nominated performance [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1091.56s)]
*  in the film Trumbo. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1094.52s)]
*  Wow, wow. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1095.8799999999999s)]
*  That's quite a run, surprising, for an old journeyman actor. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1097.16s)]
*  Got a few clips to show you here. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1102.36s)]
*  Oh, yes? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1103.92s)]
*  OK, roll it. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1104.72s)]
*  What the hell is wrong with you? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1105.92s)]
*  Cranston has been a working actor since his mid-20s. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1107.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1110.72s)]
*  Very sweet. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1111.72s)]
*  Beginning with a part on the soap opera Loving. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1112.84s)]
*  That attraction is our business, all right? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1115.56s)]
*  And after, there's been everything from the sublime [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1118.4s)]
*  to the ridiculous. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1121.28s)]
*  Good guys, bad guys. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1123.16s)]
*  He's dead! [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1124.92s)]
*  I'm sorry, we did everything we could. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1125.72s)]
*  And sometimes parts so small, even Cranston's forgotten them. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1128.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1132.2s)]
*  Says here it's Amazon women on the moon. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1132.84s)]
*  Five minutes for The Widow, do you mind? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1134.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1136.32s)]
*  I'll take care of you later. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1137.04s)]
*  You ended up on the cutting room floor, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1137.96s)]
*  that's why you've never seen it. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1139.36s)]
*  Amazon women on the moon, who could forget? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1141.32s)]
*  Who wants to remember is a better question, actually. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1144.6s)]
*  But I promise myself. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1147.0s)]
*  In all, there have been nearly 150 roles, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1148.1599999999999s)]
*  not counting the early commercials [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1151.04s)]
*  that helped pay the bills. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1152.8799999999999s)]
*  Now you can relieve inflamed hemorrhoidal tissue [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1154.56s)]
*  with the oxygen action of Preparation H. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1156.84s)]
*  Oxygen action. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1159.1599999999999s)]
*  Do you think you've grown as an actor since then? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1160.96s)]
*  No, but my hemorrhoid has grown. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1164.48s)]
*  There were guest spots on just about every show on television. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1167.48s)]
*  Hello, Tim. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1170.44s)]
*  Including five appearances on Seinfeld. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1171.84s)]
*  Jerry! [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1174.3999999999999s)]
*  Hey, Tim. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1175.12s)]
*  Is Jerry's smarmy dentist, Dr. Tim Wadley. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1175.84s)]
*  Cheryl, would you ready the nitrous oxide, please? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1178.96s)]
*  It was like going to comedy boot camp for me, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1181.3999999999999s)]
*  being on that show. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1184.04s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1185.32s)]
*  And comedy proved to be something [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1187.3999999999999s)]
*  that Bryan Cranston was very good at. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1189.08s)]
*  I just want to celebrate another day of living. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1191.48s)]
*  It led to his breakout role in the widely acclaimed series [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1196.6799999999998s)]
*  Malcolm in the Middle, as Hal, the hapless father, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1200.04s)]
*  overwhelmed by the chaos of a dysfunctional family. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1203.64s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1206.8400000000001s)]
*  Something we have to talk about. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1208.8400000000001s)]
*  He was insecure, you know, not in charge. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1211.0400000000002s)]
*  Hello, well. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1214.5200000000002s)]
*  He took brain vacations often. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1216.16s)]
*  Malcolm earned Cranston a modicum of fame, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1220.92s)]
*  three Emmy nominations, and a reputation [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1223.44s)]
*  as an actor who was willing to do anything. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1226.0s)]
*  Those are real bees? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1229.0s)]
*  Yeah, those are real bees. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1229.88s)]
*  And there were 75,000 of them. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1231.48s)]
*  Control, animal control. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1233.48s)]
*  And yes, he got stung. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1237.24s)]
*  Where were you stung? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1239.28s)]
*  In the lower region, in one of the buoys down below. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1240.4s)]
*  Sensitive spot. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1245.08s)]
*  Very sensitive. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1245.96s)]
*  The beekeeper went, sorry. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1246.92s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1248.1200000000001s)]
*  I'll help you anywhere else by the knife, sorry. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1250.04s)]
*  Now, you are going to get up and pull it out. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1252.68s)]
*  He did seven seasons on Malcolm and hated to see it go. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1255.68s)]
*  But the show's cancellation turned out [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1259.3600000000001s)]
*  to be a very lucky moment. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1261.56s)]
*  Had Malcolm in the middle been picked up, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1263.6399999999999s)]
*  I would not have been available for the pilot of Breaking Bad. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1265.96s)]
*  And right now, someone else would [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1269.1599999999999s)]
*  be sitting in this chair talking to you, not me. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1270.58s)]
*  Luck, both good and bad, figures a lot in Cranston's life [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1273.6799999999998s)]
*  and in the memoir he's just written. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1277.24s)]
*  It's published by Simon & Schuster, which is owned by CBS. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1279.3999999999999s)]
*  He grew up in a family that knew firsthand the uncertainty [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1283.84s)]
*  of a life in show business. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1287.1599999999999s)]
*  His parents were both actors. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1289.12s)]
*  His mother gave it up to raise Brian, his brother, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1291.04s)]
*  and his sister, while his father struggled to make [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1293.84s)]
*  a name for himself in Hollywood. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1296.48s)]
*  He really wanted to be a star. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1298.44s)]
*  He really wanted to hit big. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1300.84s)]
*  Observation post number three to emergency lab. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1303.3999999999999s)]
*  But mostly, Joe Cranston got small parts [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1305.96s)]
*  in films like The Beginning of the End, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1308.48s)]
*  Getting Eaten by giant grasshoppers. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1310.96s)]
*  Ah! [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1313.32s)]
*  Ah! [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1313.82s)]
*  Eventually, his father realized that playing bit parts [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1317.0s)]
*  was about as far as he was going to go. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1320.16s)]
*  There would be no stardom. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1322.68s)]
*  He had a massive middle age breakdown and left the family. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1324.8000000000002s)]
*  And then it just completely fell apart. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1331.96s)]
*  And my mother was heartbroken, just completely devastated. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1334.44s)]
*  To make ends meet, we started selling off [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1338.6000000000001s)]
*  all our possessions. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1342.28s)]
*  You were poor. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1343.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1344.16s)]
*  We had our house foreclosed on. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1345.16s)]
*  We were kicked out. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1348.0800000000002s)]
*  It was the 1960s, and Brian was 11 years old. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1349.6s)]
*  Being from a divorced family almost felt like a scarlet [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1353.28s)]
*  letter at times. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1356.72s)]
*  And I denied it for a long time. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1357.96s)]
*  In fact, I told our dear friends, the Burrell boys, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1360.2s)]
*  five boys live next door to us. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1363.36s)]
*  Why, we don't see your dad anymore. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1365.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1367.6799999999998s)]
*  I lied. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1368.76s)]
*  I said, he comes home at night when you guys are in bed. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1369.26s)]
*  He gets us out and we play. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1371.72s)]
*  I said it so much, I started to believe it myself. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1376.08s)]
*  The abandonment by his father created anger and resentment, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1379.76s)]
*  but also a deep reservoir of life lessons and emotions [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1383.36s)]
*  that he would draw upon as he grew older [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1387.56s)]
*  and decided to become an actor, the perils of stardom, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1389.8s)]
*  and the importance of family. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1393.52s)]
*  30 years ago on a forgettable show called Airwolf, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1395.8s)]
*  he met another young actor who was unforgettable. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1399.2s)]
*  You were nothing. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1402.2s)]
*  There's Robin. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1403.24s)]
*  A spoiled, rich kid who never had to pay for anything. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1404.04s)]
*  He was the bad guy, and Robin Dearden [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1408.16s)]
*  was one of his hostages. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1410.3200000000002s)]
*  He was an amazing actor and one of the funniest [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1413.3600000000001s)]
*  people I had ever met. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1416.24s)]
*  And it worked. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1417.96s)]
*  It took a while for you to get together, right? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1418.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1421.0400000000002s)]
*  We ran into each other like eight months later, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1421.5400000000002s)]
*  and we kissed for like a second too long. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1424.76s)]
*  Let me demonstrate. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1427.68s)]
*  When you greet a friend, this is the duration [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1431.16s)]
*  of the kiss that's acceptable. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1434.16s)]
*  Hi. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1435.8000000000002s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1437.0s)]
*  When you make a mistake and stay too long at the lips, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1438.8s)]
*  this is how long it is. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1442.32s)]
*  Hi. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1444.24s)]
*  How are you? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1444.74s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1445.24s)]
*  Hi. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1446.08s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1448.6799999999998s)]
*  It was like, uh-oh, what was that? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1449.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1452.72s)]
*  It was. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1453.8799999999999s)]
*  It was like, oops. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1454.3799999999999s)]
*  The kiss sealed the deal, and they were married in 1989. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1456.24s)]
*  Among the well-wishers were Cranston's mother and father, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1460.24s)]
*  keeping their distance from each other. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1463.48s)]
*  Look at Mommy. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1465.3999999999999s)]
*  Brian and Robin have been married for 27 years now. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1466.36s)]
*  They still live in the same house [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1469.4799999999998s)]
*  where they raised their daughter, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1471.0s)]
*  and Brian still goes to work most every day. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1472.52s)]
*  Oh, this is where you're shooting the scene. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1474.76s)]
*  This is where we're shooting the scene. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1476.3799999999999s)]
*  We're in Brooklyn on the set of Sneaky Pete, a 10-part crime [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1478.04s)]
*  drama Cranston is doing for Amazon Prime [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1482.12s)]
*  on the new frontier of original streaming video. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1485.08s)]
*  Oh, my god. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1487.9599999999998s)]
*  He shoehorned it into his schedule [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1490.1999999999998s)]
*  between writing the book and making a couple of new movies. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1492.28s)]
*  This is his baby, and he's running the show, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1495.64s)]
*  doing four jobs at once. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1498.1200000000001s)]
*  So you're a co-creator. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1500.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1501.6000000000001s)]
*  You're directing. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1502.1000000000001s)]

*  Executive producer. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1503.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1504.0800000000002s)]
*  Actor. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1504.5800000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1505.5600000000002s)]
*  I do force myself to sleep with myself to get the job, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1506.44s)]
*  but that's always a disappointment. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1510.3600000000001s)]
*  What's really important? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1512.2800000000002s)]
*  This day, he's wearing his director's hat, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1513.4s)]
*  checking camera angles and answering questions [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1515.6000000000001s)]

*  Let's just see if it'll. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1523.96s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1527.44s)]
*  It's a busy time, but Cranston wants [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1528.76s)]
*  to take advantage of every opportunity [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1530.92s)]
*  his good fortune has brought him while his career is still hot. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1533.1200000000001s)]
*  Do you really believe that there's going to be a time [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1536.88s)]
*  when people said, no, no, thank you, not him anymore? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1538.96s)]
*  I don't. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1541.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1541.56s)]
*  You do? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1542.2s)]
*  Oh, it's cyclical. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1542.72s)]
*  I'm riding a wave right now, and I recognize that. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1544.0s)]
*  But I want to do as much work as I can, do the best I can. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1547.3600000000001s)]
*  And when it's all said and done, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1551.48s)]
*  and they say, get out of the water, you're done, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1553.56s)]
*  I want to be so exhausted that I look forward to it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1557.8799999999999s)]
*  It's like, oh, you're right. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1560.48s)]
*  I don't want to have anything left in the tank. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1562.2s)]
*  We thought we would be remiss if we ended this story [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1564.48s)]
*  without revealing to Cranston's many fans [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1567.24s)]
*  some very personal information he shared while discussing [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1570.1599999999999s)]
*  his two favorite characters, Hal on Malcolm [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1573.6799999999998s)]
*  in the Middle and Walter White from Breaking Back. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1576.44s)]
*  Big difference between Hal and Walter White. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1579.6s)]
*  There's quite a bit of difference between them. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1581.84s)]
*  Although Tidy Whities were in common. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1583.36s)]
*  That was a thing. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1586.32s)]
*  I thought about that. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1587.24s)]
*  For Hal, it was that he was just a big boy. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1590.0s)]
*  So the Tidy Whities seemed to make sense. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1592.32s)]
*  For Walt, the Tidy Whities also made sense [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1596.6799999999998s)]
*  because they were pathetic. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1599.7199999999998s)]
*  Pathetic? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1601.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1601.9199999999998s)]
*  Does that mean you wear boxers? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1602.4399999999998s)]
*  I do. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1604.24s)]
*  I do wear boxers. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1605.32s)]
*  Or nothing at all. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1607.8799999999999s)]
*  If you feel like you're seeing a lot of Samuel L. Jackson lately, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1613.36s)]
*  it's not your imagination. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1617.7199999999998s)]
*  He seems to be everywhere. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1619.8s)]
*  There are the credit card commercials, the movie trailers, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1621.6s)]
*  not to mention a hundred or so of his films [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1624.3999999999999s)]
*  circulating on cable TV. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1626.7199999999998s)]

*  And as you might suspect, is quite a character. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1630.9599999999998s)]

*  I always wanted to see the play I was in with me in it. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1682.0s)]
*  Hard to do. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1685.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1686.2s)]
*  Very difficult. So this was perfect for me. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1686.76s)]

*  while garnering critical acclaim. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1757.2s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry, did I break your concentration? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1758.8s)]
*  I got nominated for an Academy Award, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1761.52s)]
*  but like I tell people, you know, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1764.04s)]
*  winning or losing an Academy Award [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1765.76s)]
*  doesn't do a lot toward moving the comma on your check. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1769.2s)]
*  What moves the comma on your check? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1772.8799999999999s)]
*  Bussing seats. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1774.3999999999999s)]
*  Selling tickets. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1776.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1777.52s)]
*  If you're in a movie and nobody goes to see it, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1778.52s)]
*  it's like, yeah, Academy Award winner. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1781.08s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to see that. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1783.8s)]
*  You know, you go to movies [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1785.32s)]
*  because people do exciting movies [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1787.28s)]
*  or you like the characters that they do. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1788.8799999999999s)]
*  First and foremost, Sam Jackson is a performer, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1791.08s)]
*  an entertainer in real life and on the screen. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1794.16s)]
*  He creates memorable characters. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1797.28s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1799.24s)]
*  Strong, opinionated, sometimes scary people, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1801.12s)]
*  often with a wicked sense of humor. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1804.8799999999999s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1806.84s)]
*  It's more than a persona or a brand, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1808.2s)]
*  it's almost a whole genre. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1810.36s)]
*  Raw, honest, and credible. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1812.3999999999999s)]
*  I like to play characters that express themselves verbally. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1815.36s)]
*  So I'm always looking to tell people who I am [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1821.24s)]
*  and not specifically just show them. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1825.56s)]
*  And that's just a natural quality. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1827.8s)]
*  Is that Sam Jackson? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1829.32s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1831.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't necessarily care about whether I'm liked or not. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1832.7199999999998s)]
*  And I think I've found interesting ways [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1835.6s)]
*  of making bad guys, guys that people like. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1838.8s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1844.8s)]
*  You try and keep people as human as you possibly can keep them [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1846.04s)]
*  until they have to do the thing that they have to do. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1851.0s)]
*  And that's your genre? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1853.76s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1854.84s)]
*  He grew up in Chattanooga, Tennessee, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1856.68s)]
*  not far from the Walnut Street Bridge. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1858.96s)]
*  His grandmother told him stories [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1861.84s)]
*  about black people being lynched there. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1863.6s)]
*  We used to ride our bicycles down this hill, 3rd Street. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1866.1599999999999s)]
*  It was the totally segregated Jim Crow South. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1869.0s)]
*  Everywhere he went and everyone he knew was black, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1872.48s)]
*  his neighborhood, his schools, his teachers, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1875.68s)]
*  and the experience still colors his life. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1878.8s)]
*  So I grew up in this world, which is the street world, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1881.2s)]
*  all these kids whose parents were domestics [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1884.64s)]
*  or worked in what was known as the chicken house, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1888.72s)]
*  but they killed chickens and packaged chickens [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1890.72s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1892.48s)]
*  There were a mixture of kids [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1893.64s)]
*  who were in and out of reform school. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1894.68s)]
*  We came from a place that was kind of well-versed [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1897.88s)]
*  in learning to live life as it came at you. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1901.0s)]

*  when people got ready to do stuff [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1927.32s)]
*  that was gonna get them sent to jail. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1929.36s)]
*  I just went home. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1931.52s)]
*  I understood. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1933.84s)]

*  If you get arrested, don't call me. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1936.36s)]
*  I had a greater fear of the people that I lived with [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1940.32s)]
*  who provided for me than I did of being your friend [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1942.84s)]
*  and hanging out with you and doing something stupid [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1946.04s)]
*  that's gonna get me in trouble. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1947.8s)]
*  Sam Jackson was an excellent student, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1949.32s)]
*  and in 1966, went off to study biology [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1951.6799999999998s)]

*  No. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1978.44s)]
*  I mean, you got thrown out [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1979.84s)]
*  for occupying the president's office, didn't you? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=1980.8799999999999s)]

*  This is where you did your first work? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2003.56s)]
*  Yes, this was where it all started. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2005.24s)]
*  It was one of the first times during my college experience [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2007.64s)]
*  I was anxious to get up and be somewhere. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2013.04s)]
*  Still the same? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2016.12s)]

*  or being in a movie set's my favorite thing to do. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2022.52s)]
*  But probably the most significant thing to happen [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2025.3999999999999s)]
*  to Sam Jackson in Atlanta was meeting Latonya Richardson, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2027.8799999999999s)]
*  a talented fellow student actor at Spelman College. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2032.0s)]

*  and emotionally detached, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2038.76s)]

*  It's fun, it's sad, it's happy, it's creative. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2061.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a conversation. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2070.72s)]

*  We would go and watch each other work. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2098.52s)]
*  We'd party together. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2100.88s)]

*  so you'd see each other on Mondays at unemployment. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2106.32s)]
*  By 1990, Jackson was an established New York actor, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2110.2s)]
*  having played memorable characters [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2114.04s)]

*  Hot! [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2124.68s)]
*  But personally, his life was a mess. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2125.68s)]
*  He had some drug and alcohol issues. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2130.64s)]
*  They weren't issues till the end. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2132.7999999999997s)]
*  What do you mean the end? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2136.04s)]
*  You know, I wasn't managing it as well as I used to. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2139.2s)]
*  That's when they were issues. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2143.7999999999997s)]
*  Before that, it was just life. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2145.24s)]
*  You know, I drank, I smoked, I got high. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2146.64s)]
*  It wasn't in the way of my life in that way, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2151.16s)]
*  or I didn't think it was. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2153.72s)]
*  He was going to work, taking his daughter to school, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2155.24s)]
*  and making enough money to develop a taste for cocaine, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2157.9599999999996s)]
*  and he went all in. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2161.24s)]
*  Did it reach addiction stage? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2162.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2165.04s)]
*  Well, you know, it's hard to smoke cocaine [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2165.64s)]
*  and not get addicted. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2167.3999999999996s)]
*  Smoking cocaine will bring you to your knees pretty quick. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2168.8399999999997s)]
*  It ended one night on the kitchen floor. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2171.56s)]
*  And I bought the cocaine. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2173.8399999999997s)]
*  I went home. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2174.9599999999996s)]
*  I cooked it. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2176.12s)]
*  And when I woke up, Latanya was standing over me, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2177.3599999999997s)]
*  and I was passed out on the floor, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2180.72s)]
*  and I never got to smoke it. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2182.3999999999996s)]
*  Next day, I was in rehab. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2184.0s)]
*  Did you go to rehab because you wanted to or needed to, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2186.16s)]
*  or because Latanya told you you had to? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2188.4s)]
*  You know, I didn't go kicking and screaming. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2190.4s)]
*  I was tired. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2192.16s)]
*  You know? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2193.8s)]
*  Could you have done it without her? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2194.48s)]
*  I credit her because she could have just taken Zoe [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2196.92s)]
*  and walked out and been done with me, which she didn't. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2199.72s)]
*  That's a greater love than I will ever know, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2204.96s)]
*  because I don't know that I would have done that. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2210.24s)]
*  Do you think that Latanya saved your life? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2212.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2215.04s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2216.96s)]
*  You don't seem emotionally detached now. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2220.88s)]
*  Am I crying? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2224.0s)]
*  No. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2224.8s)]
*  Oh, OK, good. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2225.2000000000003s)]
*  He said you saved his life. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2230.56s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2232.6800000000003s)]
*  He saved his life. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2233.64s)]
*  He and God saved his life. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2234.88s)]
*  I have no saving, healing power. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2236.6s)]
*  I was just there. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2240.76s)]
*  In any event, it changed Jackson's life and his career. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2242.64s)]
*  I'm a crack head. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2245.8399999999997s)]
*  While he was in rehab, he got a call from Spike Lee, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2249.64s)]
*  offering him the role of drug addict Gator [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2252.7999999999997s)]
*  Purify in Jungle Fever. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2255.08s)]
*  So I'm in rehab. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2257.24s)]
*  And the call comes and told me, Jungle Fever. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2260.72s)]
*  Uh, crack head. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2264.7599999999998s)]
*  And I was like, OK, good. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2267.72s)]
*  I'm doing the research. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2268.72s)]

*  So I'm ready to do it. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2271.16s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2272.6s)]
*  And that's what opened the door. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2273.48s)]
*  That's what got me into Hollywood. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2274.64s)]

*  Festival for best supporting actor. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2281.92s)]
*  And Gator became this cathartic kind of thing for me. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2284.24s)]
*  It was basically killing off who I was or who I had been that [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2288.12s)]

*  wide berth with his performance. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2365.3999999999996s)]
*  But he's not always entirely flexible. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2367.64s)]
*  So if a director wants you to do something you don't think [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2369.96s)]
*  would be good for you or good for the film, you won't do it. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2373.04s)]
*  No, pretty much. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2375.56s)]
*  They understand that when they hire you. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2377.2799999999997s)]
*  Some people think that they can overcome it, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2378.8399999999997s)]
*  that we can come to a compromise. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2380.96s)]
*  They'll go, look, I get what you're doing [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2383.2s)]
*  and I understand it, but can we try this other thing one time? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2386.0s)]
*  No, we can't. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2389.8s)]
*  Because if I do it one time and it's on film, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2391.6s)]
*  when you go to the editing room, that's the thing you like. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2394.4s)]
*  That's the first thing you're going to look at, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2397.16s)]
*  not the logical thing that I did. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2399.12s)]
*  So let's just not do what you want to do [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2400.6s)]
*  so you don't have that option. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2402.6s)]
*  His mantra has always been, what does the audience want to see? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2405.56s)]
*  And then he tries to give it to them. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2409.56s)]
*  That's what I was taught when I was doing theater, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2411.68s)]
*  that when you come on stage, you want to light it up to the point [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2414.66s)]
*  that when you leave, people want to go with you. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2418.54s)]
*  And I hope that's who I am when I show up. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e3MMhIXFqY&t=2422.3799999999997s)]
