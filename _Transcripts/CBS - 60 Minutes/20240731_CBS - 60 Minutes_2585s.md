# Quantum Computing; Knife; College of Magic | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o)
*  This machine can create nearly the coldest conditions in the universe at about 460 degrees [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=0.0s)]
*  below zero. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=14.72s)]
*  In that environment, a radically new kind of computer may change civilization as we [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=16.42s)]
*  know it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=22.64s)]
*  We're looking at a race between China, between IBM, Google, Microsoft, Honeywell, because [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=23.64s)]
*  the nation or company that does this will rule the world economy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=30.68s)]
*  Did people try to kill you? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=38.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=40.0s)]
*  Author Salman Rushdie has been a marked man for nearly half his life, and in 2022, a knife-wielding [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=41.0s)]
*  attacker almost killed him. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=47.08s)]
*  This is his first television interview. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=49.6s)]
*  One of the surgeons who had saved my life said to me, he said, first you were really [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=52.4s)]
*  unlucky and then you were really lucky. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=57.32s)]
*  I said, what's the lucky part? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=58.96s)]
*  And he said, well, the lucky part was that the man who attacked you had no idea how to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=61.16s)]
*  kill a man with a knife. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=65.72s)]
*  You can't wave a wand and make intolerance, hardship and violence disappear, but you can [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=69.68s)]
*  use magic to try. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  We learn that after visiting a remarkable school in Cape Town, South Africa. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=78.76s)]
*  It's called the College of Magic. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=82.76s)]
*  While it's not an accredited institution, it is a real-life Hogwarts, a school filled [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=85.48s)]
*  with students from privilege and from poverty. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  One, two, three, focus, focus! [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=100.92s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=102.28s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=103.48s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=104.92s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=106.12s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  Those stories tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=109.2s)]
*  Artificial intelligence is the magic of the moment, but this is a story about what's next, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=120.0s)]
*  something incomprehensible. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=126.72s)]
*  This past December, IBM announced an advance in an entirely new kind of computing, one [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=129.6s)]
*  that may solve problems in minutes that would take today's supercomputers millions of years. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=136.48s)]
*  That's the difference in quantum computing, a technology being developed at IBM, Google [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=144.28s)]
*  and others. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=150.04s)]
*  It's named for quantum physics, which describes the forces of the subatomic realm. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  And as we told you last winter, the science is deep and we can't scratch the surface. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=157.64s)]
*  But we hope to explain just enough so that you won't be blindsided by a breakthrough [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=164.72s)]
*  that could transform civilization. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=170.04s)]
*  The quantum computer pushes the limits of knowledge. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  New science, new engineering, all leading to this processor that computes with the atomic [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=180.28s)]
*  forces that created the universe. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  I think this moment, it feels to us like the pioneers on the 1940s and 50s that were building [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=191.32s)]
*  the first digital computers. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=197.6s)]
*  Dario Gil is something of a quantum crusader. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=199.44s)]
*  Spanish-born with a PhD in electrical engineering, Gil is head of research at IBM. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=202.72s)]
*  How much faster is this than, say, the world's best supercomputer today? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=209.88s)]
*  We are now in a stage where we can do certain calculations with these systems that would [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=215.76s)]
*  take the biggest supercomputers in the world to be able to do some similar calculation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=224.0s)]
*  But the beauty of it is that we see that we're going to continue to expand that capability [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=229.88s)]
*  such that not even a million or a billion of those supercomputers connected together [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=237.56s)]
*  could do the calculations of these future machines. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  So we've come a long way, and the most exciting part is that we have a roadmap and a journey [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=247.32000000000002s)]
*  right now where that is going to continue to increase at a rate that is going to be shocking. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=254.28s)]
*  I'm not sure the world is prepared for this change. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=260.2s)]
*  Definitely not. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=263.36s)]
*  To understand the change, go back to 1947 and the invention of a switch called a transistor. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=265.16s)]
*  The transistor, a new name. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=273.12s)]
*  Computers have processed information on transistors ever since, getting faster as more transistors [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  were squeezed onto a chip, billions of them today. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  But it takes that many because each transistor holds information in only two states. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=288.12s)]
*  It's either on or it's off, like a coin, heads or tails. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=294.68s)]
*  Quantum abandons transistors and encodes information on electrons that behave like this coin we [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  created with animation. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=308.44s)]
*  Electrons behave in a way so that they are heads and tails and everything in between. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=311.48s)]
*  You've gone from handling one bit of information at a time on a transistor to exponentially [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=317.48s)]
*  more data. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=324.0s)]
*  You can see that there is a fantastic amount of information stored when you can look at [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=326.08s)]
*  all possible angles, not just up or down. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=330.64s)]
*  Physicist Michio Kaku of the City University of New York already calls today's computers [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=335.32s)]
*  classical. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=341.16s)]
*  He uses a maze to explain quantum's difference. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=343.12s)]
*  Let's look at a classical computer calculating how a mouse navigates a maze. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=347.48s)]
*  It is painful. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=352.92s)]
*  One by one it has to map every single left turn, right turn, left turn, right turn before [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=354.6s)]
*  it finds the goal. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  Now a quantum computer scans all possible routes simultaneously. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=361.68s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=367.44s)]
*  How many turns are there? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=368.68s)]
*  Hundreds of possible turns, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=370.32s)]
*  Quantum computers do it all at once. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  Kaku's book titled Quantum Supremacy explains the stakes. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=376.20000000000005s)]
*  We're looking at a race. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=381.08000000000004s)]
*  A race between China, between IBM, Google, Microsoft, Honeywell. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=382.72s)]
*  All the big boys are in this race to create a workable, operationally efficient quantum [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=389.8s)]
*  computer. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=396.04s)]
*  Because the nation or company that does this will rule the world economy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=397.04s)]
*  But a reliable general purpose quantum computer is a tough climb yet. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=403.72s)]
*  Maybe that's why this wall is in the lobby of Google's quantum lab in California. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=409.56s)]
*  Here we got an inside look, starting with a microscope's view of what replaces the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  transistor. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=423.2s)]
*  This right here is one qubit and this is another qubit. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=424.56s)]
*  This is a five qubit chain. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=427.72s)]
*  Those crosses at the bottom are qubits, short for quantum bits. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=430.34000000000003s)]
*  They hold the electrons and act like artificial atoms. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=435.66s)]
*  Unlike transistors, each additional qubit doubles the computer's power. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=439.90000000000003s)]
*  It's exponential. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=445.78000000000003s)]
*  So while 20 transistors are 20 times more powerful than one, 20 qubits are a million [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=447.66s)]
*  times more powerful than one. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=455.36s)]
*  So this gets positioned right here on the fridge. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  Karina Chow, chief operating officer of Google's lab, showed us the processor that holds the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=462.5s)]
*  qubits. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=468.64s)]
*  Much of that above chills the qubits to what physicists call near absolute zero. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=470.12s)]
*  Near absolute zero, I understand, is about 460 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=477.84s)]
*  So that's about as cold as anything can get. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=483.48s)]
*  Yes, almost as cold as possible. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=485.84s)]
*  Temperature inside a sealed computer is one of the coldest places in the universe. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=488.5s)]
*  The deep freeze eliminates electrical resistance and isolates the qubits from outside vibrations [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=495.56s)]
*  so they can be controlled with an electromagnetic field. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=502.76s)]
*  The qubits must vibrate in unison, but that's a tough trick called coherence. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=506.92s)]
*  Once you achieve coherence of the qubits, how easy is that to maintain? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=514.6s)]
*  It's really hard. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=520.22s)]
*  Coherence is very challenging. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=522.6s)]
*  Coherence is fleeting. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  In all similar machines, coherence breaks down constantly, creating errors. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=526.36s)]
*  We're making about one error in every hundred or so steps. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=532.74s)]
*  Ultimately, we think we're going to need about one error in every million or so steps. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=537.02s)]
*  That would probably be identified as one of the biggest barriers. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=542.4s)]
*  Mitigating those errors and extending coherence time while scaling up to larger machines are [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=547.04s)]
*  the challenges facing German-American scientist Hartmut Neven, who founded Google's lab and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=553.86s)]
*  its CasualStyle in 2012. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=560.4s)]
*  Can the problems that are in the way of quantum computing be solved? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=563.88s)]
*  I should confess my subtitle here is Chief Optimist. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=568.6s)]
*  So after having said this, I would say at this point, we don't need any more fundamental [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=572.4s)]

*  We need little improvements here and there. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=580.52s)]
*  We have all the pieces together. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=582.44s)]
*  We just need to integrate them well to build larger and larger systems. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=584.48s)]
*  And you think that all of this will be integrated into a system in what period of time? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=588.32s)]
*  Yeah, we often say we want to do it by the end of the decade so that we can use this [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=592.52s)]
*  Kennedy quote and get it done by the end of the decade. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=597.5600000000001s)]
*  The end of this decade? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=601.5600000000001s)]
*  Five or six years? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=602.5600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=603.5600000000001s)]
*  That's about the timeline Dario Gil predicts and the IBM research director told us something [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  surprising. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=610.76s)]
*  There are problems that classical computers can never solve. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=612.5s)]
*  Can never solve. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=616.28s)]
*  And I think this is an important point because we're accustomed to saying, ah, computers [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  get better. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=621.36s)]
*  Actually, there are many, many problems that are so complex that we can make that statement [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=622.36s)]
*  that actually, classical computers will never be able to solve that problem. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=630.4s)]
*  Not now, not 100 years from now, not a thousand years from now. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=635.36s)]
*  You actually require a different way to represent information and process information. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=639.1800000000001s)]
*  That's what quantum gives you. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=645.1s)]
*  Quantum could give us answers to impossible problems in physics, chemistry, engineering [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=647.16s)]
*  and medicine, which is why IBM and Cleveland Clinic have installed one of the first quantum [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=653.28s)]
*  computers to leave the lab for the real world. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  Takes time, it takes way too much time to find the solutions we need. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=664.7199999999999s)]
*  We sat down with Dario Gil and Dr. Serpil Erzrum, chief research officer at Cleveland [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=670.7s)]
*  Clinic. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=677.26s)]
*  She told us, health care would be transformed if quantum computers can model the behavior [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=678.4000000000001s)]
*  of proteins, the molecules that regulate all life. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=684.86s)]
*  Proteins change shape to change function in ways too complex to follow. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=689.98s)]
*  And when they get it wrong, that causes disease. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=695.74s)]
*  It takes on many shapes, many, many shapes, depending upon what it's doing and where [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=699.6s)]
*  it is and which other protein it's with. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=704.76s)]
*  I need to understand the shape it's in when it's doing an interaction or a function that [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=707.98s)]
*  I don't want it to do for that patient. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=714.24s)]
*  Cancer, autoimmunity, it's a problem. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=717.0s)]
*  We are limited completely by the computational ability to look at the structure in real time [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=720.76s)]

*  you saw earlier. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=743.24s)]
*  Quantum is not solving the protein problem yet. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=745.48s)]
*  This is more of a trial run to introduce researchers to quantum's potential. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=748.72s)]
*  The people using this machine, are they having to learn an entirely different way to communicate [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=754.68s)]
*  with a computer? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  I think that's what's really nice, that you actually just use a regular laptop and you [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=762.0799999999999s)]
*  write a program, very much like you would write a traditional program. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=767.0799999999999s)]
*  But when you click go and run, it just happens to run on a very different kind of computer. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=771.68s)]
*  There are a half dozen competing designs in the race. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=779.04s)]
*  China named quantum a top national priority and the US government is spending nearly a [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=782.92s)]
*  billion dollars a year on research. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=788.56s)]
*  The first change is expected to come this year when the US publishes new standards for [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=791.52s)]
*  encryption, because quantum is expected one day to break the codes that lock everything [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=798.24s)]
*  from national secrets to credit cards. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=804.5799999999999s)]
*  This past December, IBM unveiled its Quantum System 2 with three times the qubits as the [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=807.94s)]
*  machine you saw in Cleveland. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=815.58s)]
*  Last year, we saw System 2 under construction. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=820.22s)]
*  It's a machine unlike anything we've ever built. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=824.5400000000001s)]
*  And this is it? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=827.5s)]
*  This is it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=828.58s)]
*  IBM's Dario Gill told us System 2 has the room to expand to thousands of qubits. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=829.58s)]
*  What are the chances that this is one of those things that's going to be ready in five years [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=837.02s)]
*  and always will be? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=843.14s)]
*  We don't see an obstacle right now that will prevent us from building systems that will [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=845.0s)]
*  have tens of thousands and even a hundred thousand qubits working with each other. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=850.5s)]
*  So we are highly confident that we will get there. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=854.74s)]
*  Of all the amazing things we heard, it was physicist Michio Kaku who led us down the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=858.0600000000001s)]
*  path to the biggest idea of all. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=864.82s)]
*  He said we were walking through a quantum computer. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=867.7s)]
*  Processing information with subatomic particles is how the universe works. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=872.9s)]
*  You know, when I look at the night sky, I see stars, I look at the flowers, the trees, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=877.54s)]
*  I realize that it's all quantum, the splendor of the universe itself. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=882.58s)]
*  The language of the universe is the language of the quantum. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=886.8s)]
*  Processing that language may bring more than inconceivable speed. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=891.46s)]
*  Reverse engineering nature's computer could be a window on creation itself. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=896.34s)]
*  Salman Rushdie has been a marked man for nearly half his life. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=912.22s)]
*  In 1989, Iran's leader Ayatollah Khomeini declared his novel, The Satanic Verses, blasphemous, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=916.98s)]
*  an insult to Islam, and called for the Indian-born writer's assassination. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=922.46s)]
*  Rushdie went into hiding with around-the-clock police protection for 10 years. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=927.54s)]
*  He eventually moved to the U.S. and thought he was safe. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=931.86s)]
*  But in August 2022, as he was about to speak at a literary festival in Chautauqua, New [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=935.14s)]
*  York, Salman Rushdie was attacked by a Muslim man with a knife. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=939.82s)]
*  Rushdie, who's now 77, lost his right eye and came close to dying. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=944.38s)]
*  He's come to terms with the attempt on his life by writing a book about it, called simply [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=949.54s)]
*  Knife, which came out in April. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=953.78s)]
*  We spoke to Rushdie earlier this year in his first television interview since the attack. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=956.9399999999999s)]
*  You had had a dream two days, I think it was, before the attack. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=962.74s)]
*  What was the dream? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=967.8599999999999s)]
*  I kind of had a premonition. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=968.8599999999999s)]
*  I had a dream of being attacked in an amphitheater. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=970.34s)]
*  It was a kind of Roman Empire dream, as if I was in the Coliseum. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=974.46s)]
*  And it was just somebody with a spear stabbing downwards and I was rolling around on the [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=980.54s)]
*  floor trying to get away from him. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=983.74s)]
*  And I woke up and was quite shaken by it. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=986.86s)]
*  And I had to go to Chautauqua, and I said to my wife, Eliza, I said, you know, I don't [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=990.1800000000001s)]
*  want to go. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=995.4200000000001s)]
*  Because of the dream? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=996.4200000000001s)]
*  Because of the dream. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=997.4200000000001s)]
*  Don't be silly. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=998.66s)]
*  It's a dream. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=999.66s)]
*  Salman Rushdie, one of his generation's most acclaimed writers, had been invited to the [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1000.66s)]
*  town of Chautauqua, close to Lake Erie, to speak about a subject he knows all too well, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1005.5s)]
*  the importance of protecting writers whose lives are under threat. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1011.86s)]
*  Did you have any anxiety being in such a public space? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1015.86s)]
*  Not really, because in the more than 20 years that I've been living in America, I've done [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1020.3399999999999s)]
*  a lot of these things. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1026.82s)]
*  You haven't had security around you, a close protection detail for a long time. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1028.02s)]
*  Long time. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1031.3s)]
*  But you know, what happens in many places that you go and lecture is that they're used [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1032.3s)]
*  to having a certain degree of security, venue security. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1036.78s)]
*  In this case, there wasn't any. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1040.98s)]
*  The irony, of course, is you were there to talk about writers in danger. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1042.26s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1045.78s)]
*  And the need for writers from other countries to have safe spaces in America, amongst other [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1047.06s)]
*  places. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1052.02s)]
*  And then, yeah, it just turned out not to be a safe space for me. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1053.02s)]
*  For years, no place was safe for Salman Rushdie, whose sprawling 600-page novel The Satanic [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1056.58s)]
*  Verses offended some Muslims for its depiction of the Prophet Muhammad. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1062.54s)]
*  Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, a religious decree calling for Rushdie's [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1066.86s)]
*  death in 1989. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1074.34s)]
*  There were worldwide protests from London to Lahore. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1078.34s)]
*  The Satanic Verses was burned and 12 people died in clashes with police. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1081.98s)]
*  The book's Japanese translator was murdered and others associated with it were attacked. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1086.78s)]
*  Did you have any idea that it would cause violence? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1092.26s)]
*  No, I had no idea. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1095.38s)]
*  I thought probably some conservative religious people wouldn't like it. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1096.94s)]
*  They didn't like anything I wrote anyway. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1100.82s)]
*  So I thought, well, they don't have to read it. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1102.42s)]
*  Were you naive? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1105.34s)]
*  Probably. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1106.34s)]
*  You know, it's easy looking back to think, but nothing like this had ever happened to [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1107.34s)]
*  anybody. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1110.78s)]
*  Of course, almost all the people who attacked the book did so without reading it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1111.78s)]
*  I was often told that I had intended to insult, offend people. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1117.1399999999999s)]
*  My view was, if I need to insult you, I can do it really quickly. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1121.3s)]
*  I don't need to spend five years of my life trying to write a 600-page book to insult you. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1124.78s)]
*  Rushdie was living in London when he went into hiding and for the next 10 years, the [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1131.46s)]
*  British government provided him with 24-hour police protection. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1135.7s)]
*  Did people try to kill you? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1139.86s)]
*  There were maybe as many as half a dozen serious assassination attempts, which were not random [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1141.74s)]
*  people. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1147.3s)]
*  They were state-sponsored terrorism professionals. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1148.3s)]
*  After diplomatic negotiations, the Iranian state called off its assassins in 1998. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1150.8999999999999s)]
*  Rushdie finally came out of the shadows. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1156.74s)]
*  He moved to New York and for the next two decades lived openly. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1159.48s)]
*  He was a man about town. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1163.22s)]
*  He continued writing and became a celebrated advocate for freedom of expression. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1165.36s)]
*  So when he received the invitation to speak in Chautauqua in August 2022, he gladly accepted. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1170.58s)]
*  I was seated at stage right. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1176.8999999999999s)]
*  In his new book, Knife, he describes what happened next. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1178.86s)]
*  Then in the corner of my right eye, the last thing my right eye would ever see, I saw the [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1182.98s)]
*  man in black running towards me down the right-hand side of the seating area. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1188.22s)]
*  Black clothes, black face mask. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1193.1799999999998s)]
*  He was coming in hard and low, a squat missile. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1195.5s)]
*  I confess I had sometimes imagined my assassin rising up in some public forum or other and [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1199.34s)]
*  coming for me in just this way. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1205.74s)]
*  So my first thought when I saw this murderous shape rushing towards me was, so it's you. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1208.74s)]
*  Here you are. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1215.86s)]
*  So it's you, here you are. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1217.7s)]
*  It's like you've been waiting for it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1220.18s)]
*  That's what it felt like. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1222.3799999999999s)]
*  It felt like something coming out of the distant past and trying to drag me back in time, if [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1223.3799999999999s)]
*  you like, back into that distant past in order to kill me. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1228.58s)]
*  And when he got to me, he basically hit me very hard here. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1232.6599999999999s)]
*  And initially I thought I'd been punched. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1238.22s)]
*  You didn't actually see a knife? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1240.94s)]
*  I didn't see the knife. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1241.94s)]
*  And I didn't realize until I saw blood coming out that there would have been a knife in [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1243.42s)]
*  his fist. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1247.58s)]
*  So where was that stab? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1248.74s)]
*  Here. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1250.22s)]
*  In your neck? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1251.22s)]
*  In my neck, yeah. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1252.22s)]
*  Then there were a lot more. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1253.22s)]
*  First wounds, there was a big slash wound like this across my neck. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1254.3s)]
*  And there's a puncture stab wound here. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1259.82s)]
*  And then of course there was an attack on my eye. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1264.06s)]
*  Do you remember being stabbed in the eye? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1266.34s)]
*  No. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1269.3s)]
*  I remember falling. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1270.3s)]
*  Then I remember not knowing what had happened to my eye. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1272.38s)]
*  He was also stabbed in his hand, chest, abdomen and thigh. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1275.44s)]
*  15 wounds in all. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1279.8600000000001s)]
*  He was both stabbing and also slashing. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1282.02s)]
*  I think he was just wildly... [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1284.3s)]
*  The attack lasted 27 seconds. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1286.5s)]
*  To feel just how long that is. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1289.42s)]
*  This is what 27 seconds is. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1291.78s)]
*  That's it. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1312.02s)]
*  That's quite a long time. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1322.18s)]
*  That's the extraordinary half minute of intimacy in which life meets death. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1323.54s)]
*  What stopped it from being longer? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1332.78s)]
*  The audience pulling him off me. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1334.94s)]
*  Strangers to you? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1337.06s)]
*  To this day I don't know their names. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1338.06s)]
*  Some of those strangers restrained the attacker while others desperately tried to stem the [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1340.26s)]
*  flow of Rushdie's blood. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1344.78s)]
*  There was really a lot of blood. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1346.42s)]
*  You were actually watching your blood. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1348.62s)]
*  I was actually watching it spread. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1349.78s)]
*  And then I remember thinking that I was probably dying. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1351.54s)]
*  And it was interesting because it was quite matter of fact. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1355.02s)]
*  It wasn't like I was terrified of it or whatever. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1358.82s)]
*  And yeah, there was nothing. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1361.82s)]
*  No heavenly choirs. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1362.98s)]
*  No pearly gates. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1365.1s)]
*  I mean, I'm not a supernatural person. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1366.1s)]
*  I believe that death comes as the end. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1369.1s)]
*  There was nothing that happened that made me change my mind about that. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1371.46s)]
*  You have not had a revelation. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1374.5s)]
*  I have not had any revelation except that there's no revelation to be had. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1376.06s)]
*  His attacker, the man in black, was hustled off the stage. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1380.58s)]
*  In the book, you do not use the attacker's name. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1385.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1388.78s)]
*  I thought, you know, I don't want his name in my book. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1389.78s)]
*  And I don't use it in conversation either. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1392.4199999999998s)]
*  That is important to you not to give him space in your brain. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1394.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1397.34s)]
*  I had 27 seconds together. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1398.34s)]
*  You know, that's it. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1400.22s)]
*  I don't need to give him any more of my time. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1402.1799999999998s)]
*  Paramedics flew Rushdie to a hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania, 40 miles away, where a team [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1406.06s)]
*  of doctors battled for eight hours to save his life. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1411.1799999999998s)]
*  When he finally came out of surgery, his wife, Eliza, a poet and novelist, was waiting. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1414.6999999999998s)]
*  And he wasn't moving and he was just laid out. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1419.54s)]
*  He looked half dead to you. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1423.4199999999998s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1425.1799999999998s)]
*  He was a different color. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1426.7s)]
*  He was cold. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1428.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, his face was stapled, just staples holding his face together. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1429.6200000000001s)]
*  Rushdie was on a ventilator, unable to speak. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1436.38s)]
*  Eliza and the doctors had no idea whether the knife that had penetrated his eye had [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1439.6200000000001s)]
*  damaged his brain. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1444.64s)]
*  Someone from the staff said that we would use this system of wiggling the toes. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1446.46s)]
*  To communicate? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1452.8600000000001s)]
*  To communicate. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1453.8600000000001s)]
*  Was that the first question you asked to get a wiggle? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1454.8999999999999s)]
*  I think I said, Salman, it's Eliza. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1457.26s)]
*  Can you hear me? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1459.3799999999999s)]
*  And there was a wiggle. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1460.9399999999998s)]
*  And asked him, I think, can you, do you know where you are? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1465.1399999999999s)]
*  And he wiggled. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1468.1399999999999s)]
*  And it was very basic, simple questions. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1470.82s)]
*  You can't express yourself with any subtlety with your toes. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1473.86s)]
*  Which is your favorite thing. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1477.78s)]
*  After 18 days in the hospital and three weeks in rehab, Rushdie was discharged. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1482.18s)]
*  One of the surgeons who had saved my life said to me, first you were really unlucky [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1488.3s)]
*  and then you were really lucky. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1493.42s)]
*  I said, what's the lucky part? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1495.46s)]
*  He said, well, the lucky part is that the man who attacked you had no idea how to kill [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1497.8200000000002s)]
*  a man with a knife. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1501.6000000000001s)]
*  You're not a believer in miracles, but the fact that you survived, you write in the book, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1503.1000000000001s)]
*  is a miracle. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1507.0600000000002s)]
*  This is a contradiction. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1508.64s)]
*  How does somebody who doesn't believe in the supernatural account for the fact that [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1510.78s)]
*  something has happened which feels like a miracle? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1514.86s)]
*  I mean, I certainly don't feel that some hand reached down from the skies and guarded me. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1516.74s)]
*  But I do think something happened which wasn't supposed to happen. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1522.1s)]
*  And I have no explanation for it. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1526.02s)]
*  His attacker was a 24-year-old from New Jersey who lived in his mother's basement. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1528.46s)]
*  He's believed to be a lone wolf. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1533.22s)]
*  He's pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and is awaiting trial. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1535.58s)]
*  In an interview, he told the New York Post he'd only read a couple pages of the satanic [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1539.74s)]
*  verses and seen some clips of Rushdie on YouTube. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1544.02s)]
*  He said he didn't like him very much because Rushdie had attacked Islam. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1547.66s)]
*  Does it matter to you what his motive was? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1553.02s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting to me because it's a mystery. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1555.66s)]
*  If I had written a character who knew so little about his proposed victim and yet was willing [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1559.66s)]
*  to commit the crime of murder, my publishers might well say to me that that's under-motivated. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1566.14s)]
*  You need to develop that character. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1571.46s)]
*  Yeah, not enough of a reason. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1572.46s)]
*  You know, not convincing. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1574.26s)]
*  But yet that's what he did. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1576.7800000000002s)]
*  Rushdie's Knife, his 22nd book, is one he initially did not want to write. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1579.3000000000002s)]
*  That was the last thing I wanted to do. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1584.3000000000002s)]
*  Because you didn't want this to yet again define you? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1586.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1589.3000000000002s)]
*  It was very difficult for me after the satanic verses was published that the only thing anybody [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1590.3000000000002s)]
*  knew about me was this death threat. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1593.82s)]
*  But it became clear to me that I couldn't write anything else. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1596.3799999999999s)]
*  You had to write this first? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1599.94s)]
*  I had to write this first. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1600.94s)]
*  I just thought I need to focus on, you know, to use the cliche, the elephant in the room. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1601.94s)]
*  And the moment I thought that, kind of something changed in my head. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1607.22s)]
*  And it then became a book I really very much wanted to write. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1611.18s)]
*  You say the language was my knife. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1614.3s)]
*  If I had unexpectedly been caught in an unwanted knife fight, maybe this was the knife I could [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1616.74s)]
*  use to fight back, to take charge of what had happened to me, to own it, make it mine. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1620.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, language is a way of breaking open the world. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1625.22s)]
*  I don't have any other weapons. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1632.3s)]
*  But I've been using this particular tool for quite a long time. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1633.98s)]
*  So I thought this was my way of dealing with it. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1637.06s)]
*  It's been almost two years since the attack and Rushdie is back home now in New York, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1640.82s)]
*  slowly getting used to navigating the world with one eye. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1646.1000000000001s)]
*  How much time did it take to kind of readjust? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1649.98s)]
*  I'm still doing it. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1651.74s)]
*  You still are? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1653.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1654.1s)]
*  Do you feel like you are a different person after the attack? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1655.1s)]
*  I don't feel I'm very different, but I do feel that it has left a shadow. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1657.66s)]
*  I think that shadow is just there. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1661.26s)]
*  And some days it's dark and some days it's not. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1663.7s)]
*  You feel less than you were before? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1667.38s)]
*  No, I just feel more the presence of death. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1669.02s)]
*  In an interview almost 25 years ago, you said of the fatwa, I want to find an end to this [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1672.6200000000001s)]
*  story. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1677.14s)]
*  It's one story I must find an end to. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1678.14s)]
*  Have you found that ending and an ending to this story as well? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1680.42s)]
*  Well, I thought I had and then it turned out I hadn't. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1683.3000000000002s)]
*  I'm hoping this is just a last twitch of that story. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1685.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1694.5s)]
*  I'll let you know. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1695.5s)]
*  Salman Rushdie on censorship in America today. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1700.5s)]
*  There's a movement from the left and movement from the right. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1704.6200000000001s)]

*  You can't wave a wand and make intolerance, hardship and violence disappear. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1717.54s)]
*  But you can use magic to try. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1722.14s)]
*  We learned that after visiting a remarkable school in Cape Town, South Africa. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1724.76s)]
*  It's called the College of Magic. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1728.9s)]
*  While it's not an accredited institution, it is a real-life Hogwarts. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1731.06s)]
*  A school filled with students ranging in age from 10 to 18 and, more importantly, reflecting [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1735.3799999999999s)]
*  South Africa. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1740.3799999999999s)]
*  They come from privilege and poverty. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1741.5s)]
*  Pick a canard, any canard. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1744.06s)]
*  Sleight of hand, juggling, ventriloquism, card tricks. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1745.5s)]
*  You can learn it all at the College of Magic. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1748.62s)]
*  But as we first reported two years ago, what the school really teaches is also the great [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1751.02s)]
*  superpower of magic itself. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1755.56s)]
*  Rethinking the limits of possibility. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1758.1s)]
*  It looks like any other campus. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1766.3s)]
*  Gothic architecture, a diverse student body, a core curriculum. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1769.1399999999999s)]
*  All balanced with electives. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1777.3s)]
*  To become masters of magic, these kids must be both tacticians and technicians. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1781.3s)]
*  Up, down, across. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1786.3s)]
*  And pull down, one at a time. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1788.3s)]
*  In the card form, this one requires practice, application, discipline. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1790.3s)]
*  Six, spades. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1795.3s)]
*  Ah, diamonds. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1798.3s)]
*  There is no magic bullet. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1800.3s)]
*  While students attend academic school during the week, they come here after school, on [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1802.3s)]
*  weekends and on holidays. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1806.3s)]
*  Can you do this card? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1808.3s)]
*  No. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1810.3s)]
*  It takes six years to earn a diploma. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1811.3s)]
*  One, two, three. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1813.3s)]
*  Temba Bawuti is a teacher, a graduate, and himself now a practicing magician. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1817.3s)]
*  He shows students the tricks of the trade. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1822.3s)]
*  What is it about magic? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1825.3s)]
*  What appeals to you so much about this? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1827.3s)]
*  I didn't think that I would be doing this as a career or performing it, like doing it [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1829.3s)]
*  to support myself. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1834.3s)]
*  I want to put a smile on people's faces, make them happy, entertain them, break eyes. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1836.3s)]
*  That's what I wanted to do. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1839.3s)]
*  But then it became my thing that I'm using to feed my family and myself. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1841.3s)]
*  And he says he and the school aim to teach the kids honesty, humility, and respect. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1846.3s)]
*  It sounds like the tricks and the juggling is only a small part of it. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1852.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's not a college of magic, it's a college of life. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1856.3s)]
*  Let's go upstairs. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1860.3s)]
*  For the revered dean and founder, David Gore, it's been 40 years since he stopped [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1862.3s)]
*  practicing law and pulled the ultimate bit of misdirection. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1866.3s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1869.3s)]
*  In his hometown of Cape Town, he opened a college, the only school of its kind [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1871.3s)]
*  devoted to wonder. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1875.3s)]
*  Hello. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1877.3s)]
*  I'm surely not the first person to make the joke. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1879.3s)]
*  You gave up law to pursue a career of deception. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1882.3s)]
*  I like to think of it as deception. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1885.3s)]
*  We like to think of it as illusion and wonderment. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1887.3s)]
*  This is giving some of the game away. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1889.3s)]
*  Gore's encyclopedic knowledge and love of magic fills the halls, quite literally. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1891.3s)]
*  Contraptions and memorabilia trace the history of illusion. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1896.3s)]
*  Even with all the sophistication around us, there's nothing more exciting than [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1900.3s)]
*  seeing a magician alive and seeing something appear or disappear right under your nose. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1904.3s)]
*  Well, what do you attribute that to? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1908.3s)]
*  I think people genuinely are very interested in and curious about how the laws of [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1910.3s)]
*  nature can be suspended. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1917.3s)]
*  And I think the magician offers that opportunity, that gateway to a world which [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1919.3s)]
*  we all would love to be part of, where gravity is always pulling us to planet Earth [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1924.3s)]
*  and float upwards. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1929.3s)]
*  It's a beautiful feeling. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1930.3s)]
*  Nothing here is quite as it seems. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1931.3s)]
*  On our visit here in July 2022, students were preparing for the annual Children's Magic [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1933.3s)]
*  Festival. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1938.3s)]
*  We have a dress rehearsal. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1939.3s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1940.3s)]
*  Turban or no turban? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1941.3s)]
*  I like the turban. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1942.3s)]
*  It's a good look. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1943.3s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1955.3s)]
*  Turn up your car, please. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1956.3s)]
*  Turn it up. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1958.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1959.3s)]
*  Very good. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1965.3s)]
*  That was a winner. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1966.3s)]
*  I'm coming to our close-up theater. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1967.3s)]
*  Come inside. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1969.3s)]
*  Michael Barta has been teaching here for decades. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1970.3s)]
*  I teach children how to use their hands. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1973.3s)]
*  And this, this, I do, okay, I was juggling three balls. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1977.3s)]
*  Somebody's taken my ball. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1981.3s)]
*  The school was always conceived to go beyond hocus pocus. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1983.3s)]
*  Is magic about what you see or what you miss? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1987.3s)]
*  Barta thinks it's both. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1990.3s)]
*  So how many balls do I have? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1992.3s)]
*  Magic develops skepticism and curiosity. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1994.3s)]
*  Those two things are needed in education. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=1998.3s)]
*  But that's great. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2000.3s)]
*  You come here, there's a healthy skepticism. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2001.3s)]
*  How did he do that? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2003.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2004.3s)]
*  And it's mixed with this curiosity, this wonder. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2005.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2006.3s)]
*  How did he do that? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2007.3s)]
*  I know. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2008.3s)]
*  How did he do that? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2009.3s)]
*  Wow. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2010.3s)]
*  This one's spinning around. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2011.3s)]
*  At the school's beginning, it reflected a cross-section of South Africa. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2012.3s)]
*  Now, as then, students come from the most wealthy suburbs [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2015.3s)]
*  and from Cape Town's most impoverished townships. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2019.3s)]
*  Duma Mccorkie's day starts at dawn in the tin shack he shares with his grandmother and aunt. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2023.3s)]
*  Duma's mother was murdered four years ago. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2029.3s)]
*  The sprawling shanty town, like so many others in the country, is pocked by violence and drugs. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2033.3s)]
*  Some of them are carrying guns, and some of them are carrying knives, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2039.3s)]
*  like busy robbing old people, like being on drugs and stuff. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2043.3s)]
*  So like, I have to be indoors because, hey, gunshots. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2048.3s)]
*  You're describing gunshots and knives and drugs and gangs. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2053.3s)]
*  And you come here, it must be a bit of a relief. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2060.3s)]
*  It helped me a lot. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2063.3s)]
*  It saved me from doing those stuff because I became an artist [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2064.3s)]
*  and I became to take care of myself. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2069.3s)]
*  You say artist. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2075.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2076.3s)]
*  You're a magician and you're an artist because it's art. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2077.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2080.3s)]
*  In the townships, you don't come across many bow ties, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2081.3s)]
*  so when Duma passes by, he draws attention. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2085.3s)]
*  A quick bit of whiz. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2088.3s)]
*  And gee whiz. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2093.3s)]
*  And he's off. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2102.3s)]
*  The school arranges transportation when needed, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2105.3s)]
*  shuttling the kids on the long journey into the city. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2108.3s)]
*  There is no uniform as such, but students are encouraged [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2112.3s)]
*  to dress as smartly as they can. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2115.3s)]
*  For many, going to the school marks a rare opportunity [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2118.3s)]
*  to get out of the township. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2122.3s)]
*  Tuition is $350 a year, unaffordable for most of the 130 students. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2125.3s)]
*  The college, a non-profit, raises funds to help [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2132.3s)]
*  the students get out of the township. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2135.3s)]
*  The college, a non-profit, raises funds for scholarships, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2138.3s)]
*  breakfast and lunch included. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2142.3s)]
*  You have some kids coming here who are malnourished. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2144.3s)]
*  You have to feed. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2147.3s)]
*  You have other kids getting picked up by parents [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2148.3s)]
*  in fancy sports cars. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2150.3s)]
*  Is that hard for you to watch? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2152.3s)]
*  Yes, I think it's an important part of our nation building [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2153.3s)]
*  and for understanding that young people get to understand [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2156.3s)]
*  how each other is living and how we think and how we approach life. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2161.3s)]
*  These are going to be the young people who are going to drive [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2165.3s)]
*  this nation forward. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2168.3s)]
*  I can see some people watching this saying, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2170.3s)]
*  this college of magic is all well and good [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2171.3s)]
*  and you're teaching kids to make coins disappear, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2173.3s)]
*  but why aren't you teaching them coding or something more practical? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2176.3s)]
*  I think the most important skill in the 21st century [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2179.3s)]
*  is going to be imaginative thinking, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2183.3s)]
*  because no matter which career you select to go into, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2185.3s)]
*  it's going to no longer be your knowledge around that, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2189.3s)]
*  because that knowledge is so freely available now on the internet, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2192.3s)]
*  it's going to be how you use that knowledge [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2195.3s)]
*  and there is no better topic or subject than magic [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2197.3s)]
*  to explode the whole idea of imagination. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2200.3s)]
*  They trade their cape for a three-piece suit [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2204.3s)]
*  or for a sports jersey or for a nurse's attire. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2206.3s)]
*  You're okay with that? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2210.3s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2211.3s)]
*  Fifteen-year-old Nakane Ntame is a rising star at the college, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2212.3s)]
*  but four years ago she had to beg her mother to allow her to enroll. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2216.3s)]
*  And then I was like, Mom, I would like to join this. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2221.3s)]
*  What are you talking about? I want to become a magician. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2224.3s)]
*  And she thought I was crazy, but here I am today. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2228.3s)]
*  Here you are. Your mom said you were crazy for wanting to be a magician. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2231.3s)]
*  Because they do not believe in magic. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2235.3s)]
*  Look away, please. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2238.3s)]
*  Not only that, for many in the townships, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2239.3s)]
*  magic is associated with the occult or witchcraft. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2242.3s)]
*  The first time I performed, I performed for my grandmother. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2245.3s)]
*  So she does not understand magic at all. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2249.3s)]
*  And every time she would see magic, she would be like, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2252.3s)]
*  Ah, mwloyi, which means darkness, evil powers and stuff like that. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2254.3s)]
*  People are saying, I don't understand. Explain it to me. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2258.3s)]
*  What do you tell them? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2261.3s)]
*  Oh, that magic is not black magic. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2262.3s)]
*  We do not practice any kinds of spells, dark spells. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2266.3s)]
*  There are actually secrets behind the magic. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2269.3s)]
*  And it takes time to practice and master it. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2272.3s)]
*  This effect you must follow very, very carefully, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2276.3s)]
*  because a lot of things happen. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2279.3s)]
*  Milo Dreher-Smith says his mom had to convince him to enroll. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2281.3s)]
*  Before I came to College of Magic, I was very shy. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2284.3s)]
*  So I couldn't dance even in front of my brother and sister. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2288.3s)]
*  I would just kind of go high behind my mom. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2291.3s)]
*  And my mom said I need to learn SI skills. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2293.3s)]
*  SI is social intelligence. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2296.3s)]
*  Yes. And then when we learned about the College of Magic, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2298.3s)]
*  she was like, that is the perfect spot. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2300.3s)]
*  Firstly, you'll get into a good high school [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2302.3s)]
*  because you have lots of different talents. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2304.3s)]
*  And secondly, it's SI skills. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2306.3s)]
*  I'm going to go out on a limb here. I'm going to take a risk. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2308.3s)]
*  You came here for more social intelligence [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2311.3s)]
*  to come out of your shell a little bit. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2313.3s)]
*  It seems like it's working. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2315.3s)]
*  Yeah, it is working. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2317.3s)]
*  Being a magician, do you feel like you're part of a secret society, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2318.3s)]
*  a secret club? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2321.3s)]
*  Yes. Like a secret agent of a big force. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2322.3s)]
*  Let's do a role play. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2325.3s)]
*  Milo, Milo, tell me how you do that trick. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2327.3s)]
*  No. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2330.3s)]
*  Why not? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2333.3s)]
*  Because you're a dunderhead and you wouldn't be able to understand. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2334.3s)]
*  I'm a dunderhead. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2336.3s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2337.3s)]
*  Never give up your secrets, though, right? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2339.3s)]
*  Actually, all my family has learned all of it by now [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2341.3s)]
*  because when I practice for a performance, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2344.3s)]
*  they pick up my mistakes. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2347.3s)]
*  Your family can keep a secret? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2349.3s)]
*  I'm not sure about my sister. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2351.3s)]
*  Ten miles and an incalculable distance from where Milo lives [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2355.3s)]
*  meet Lulo Stofile, Lulo the Great, as he calls himself. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2360.3s)]
*  Lulo the Great. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2364.3s)]
*  He lives in a one-bedroom home with his father Sean, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2366.3s)]
*  mother Belinda, and little sister Lolu. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2369.3s)]
*  I forgot something. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2371.3s)]
*  He, too, transformed after joining the College of Magic. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2373.3s)]
*  He's like hyperactive. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2376.3s)]
*  Was he always that way? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2378.3s)]
*  No, he was too shy like his sister. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2380.3s)]
*  This guy was shy? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2384.3s)]
*  Very, very shy. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2386.3s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2387.3s)]
*  Very, very shy. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2388.3s)]
*  But for Belinda and Sean, magic is more than a tool to get Lulo out of his shell. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLNw4C9d8o&t=2390.3s)]
