**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA)
*  Can you see the spirit from the hostages? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=0.0s)]
*  And that's what they are, is hostages. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=9.0s)]
*  He's talking about 1,000 Americans convicted in the January 6th riot. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=11.24s)]
*  The crime was severe. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=17.52s)]
*  It was an attack on our democracy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=18.84s)]
*  Tonight, the prosecutor in charge of the biggest investigation in U.S. history and the view [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=20.96s)]
*  from both sides of the riot shield. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=27.2s)]
*  We truly believe that the election was stolen for a number of reasons. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=32.4s)]
*  It's been called the most dangerous conflict no one is talking about. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=40.56s)]
*  And when we were aboard this Philippine Coast Guard ship in the South China Sea, we saw [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  for ourselves just how dangerous it is. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=52.16s)]
*  It's four in the morning. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=55.08s)]
*  We've all been sound asleep. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  This alarm just went on on the ship. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=59.36s)]
*  We were told to wake up and put our life jackets on because we've just been rammed by a Chinese [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=61.48s)]
*  boat. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=65.92s)]
*  It's unbelievable seeing that many people sing back at you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=66.92s)]
*  I couldn't believe that it was happening in that moment. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=72.92s)]
*  You know, I'd dreamt about being on that stage my whole life. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=82.68s)]
*  I thought about it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  I'd wished it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  You'd envisioned it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  I'd envisioned it so many times. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm Leslie Starr. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=102.8s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=105.2s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=106.56s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=107.8s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=109.16s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on the 57th season premiere of 60 Minutes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=110.72s)]
*  More than 1,000 Americans have been convicted in the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=117.36s)]
*  About 350 trials are still pending, and the FBI continues its dragnet for suspects. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=133.76s)]
*  The attack that stopped the count of the presidential vote triggered the largest prosecution in [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=141.38s)]
*  U.S. history. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=147.16s)]
*  But now, history is being challenged. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=148.16s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump calls the convicted patriots worthy of pardons. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=152.16s)]
*  What is the evidence? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=158.16s)]
*  We begin with the prosecutor in charge. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=160.0s)]
*  U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves told us what drives the prosecution of January 6. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  The crime was severe. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=171.16s)]
*  It was an attack on our democracy. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=172.5s)]
*  Once you replace votes and deliberation with violence and intimidation, you've lost the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=175.56s)]
*  democratic process. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=180.52s)]
*  You've lost the rule of law. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=181.52s)]
*  But it's also about the victims, the officer victims who were injured that day, and making [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  sure we hold people accountable for the harm that they inflicted on the 140 officers who [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=189.24s)]
*  reported physical injury. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=194.56s)]
*  Matthew Graves has worked in the Bush and Biden Justice Departments. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  Now as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, he's won more than 1,000 January 6 convictions [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=201.4s)]
*  and lost only two of the cases at trial. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=208.8s)]
*  What is the best evidence that you've had? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  The crimes that occurred that day are probably the most recorded crimes in all of our history. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  You also have the words of the defendants explaining what they were going to do or what [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=220.96s)]
*  they had done. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=225.5s)]
*  The joke took over the Capitol, overran the Capitol. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=227.1s)]
*  Stop the steal! [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=230.5s)]
*  Stop the steal! [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=231.5s)]
*  Evidence from the trials show many in the mob were determined to stop the count of the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=232.9s)]
*  electoral vote that would certify Joe Biden's victory. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=238.22s)]
*  They were enraged by President Trump's false claims of a stolen election. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=243.06s)]
*  You must have felt strongly to drive 2,000 miles to Washington. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=250.02s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=254.14s)]
*  I still feel very strongly. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=255.14s)]
*  Jared Hughes came from Montana. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=257.38s)]
*  He's a married 39-year-old construction worker with a daughter and a grievance. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=259.97999999999996s)]
*  The way this country's headed, my paycheck, you know, my wife disabled, and it's been [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=265.62s)]
*  hell for us to try to, you know, try to make it with the tens of thousands of dollars of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=271.9s)]
*  medical bills, you know, and a lot of us see Donald Trump, the outsider, coming in and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=277.02s)]
*  trying to help us out, trying to help the little guy out against the big government. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=281.74s)]
*  That's Jared Hughes at lower right in the khaki cap, among the first inside the Capitol. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=288.5s)]
*  That's Hughes inside at the door, kicking it out so the mob can rush in. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=295.1s)]
*  You guys don't know what you did. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=300.22s)]
*  You don't f***ing want this. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=302.22s)]
*  We are f***ing mad. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=304.22s)]
*  We are mad! [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=306.22s)]
*  No matter how I look at it, I share some of the responsibility for everything that happened [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=307.22s)]
*  that day, letting people in, being a part of that mob. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=311.54s)]
*  I didn't personally fight any cops or engage with any officers, but I have a lot of family [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=314.06s)]
*  that are police officers. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=318.3s)]
*  I have a tremendous amount of respect for police, and I did not like seeing them being [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=319.3s)]
*  assaulted. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=322.58000000000004s)]
*  We didn't see a lot of respect for police in that video. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=326.82000000000005s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=328.3s)]
*  I mean, I'll hold my hand up and say I was wrong. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=329.3s)]
*  I should not have been screaming at those cops. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=331.62s)]
*  It's not something I'm proud of. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=333.18s)]
*  Others did much worse. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=336.26s)]
*  I became trapped. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=340.94s)]
*  They pinned me against the door frame, and with my arms at my side, I couldn't mount [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=342.5s)]
*  any kind of defense. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=348.12s)]
*  Officer Daniel Hodges of D.C.'s Metropolitan Police defended an entrance known as the West [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=351.08s)]
*  Front Tunnel. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=357.94s)]
*  Someone was pinning me with a police shield, and another member of the crowd grabbed my [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=364.1s)]
*  gas mask by the filter in front and just started essentially punching me in the face [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=370.54s)]
*  while holding onto it, and then eventually ripped it off my head. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=375.66s)]
*  And then he stole my riot baton out of my hands and beat me in the head with it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=379.58000000000004s)]
*  What were you defending? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=388.78000000000003s)]
*  Democracy. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=390.74s)]
*  Democracy stopped for about six hours. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=393.1s)]
*  The vote was counted at 3.44 a.m. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=396.44s)]
*  With two weeks until Inauguration Day, it was the Trump Justice Department that set [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=400.42s)]
*  the standards for the prosecutions. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=406.3s)]
*  Decisions were made by career prosecutors, who work at justice for years, regardless [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=409.58000000000004s)]
*  of who the president might be. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=415.3s)]
*  The career prosecutors quickly realized that you needed guidelines in place, determinations [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=417.66s)]
*  about who was going to be charged, who wasn't going to be charged, and what they would be [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=422.06s)]
*  charged with. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=425.36s)]
*  That process started in January 7, 2021, during the prior administration. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=427.0s)]
*  To this day, we continue to use guidelines that the career prosecutors put in place during [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=432.82s)]
*  the prior administration. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=437.72s)]
*  And how did they guide you? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=439.18s)]
*  What we're generally focusing on, of the thousands of people who you could potentially charge [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=440.54s)]
*  that day, are people who actually entered into the Capitol, people who engaged in violent [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=445.22s)]
*  or destructive behavior, people who illegally carried firearms or other weapons on Capitol [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=449.76s)]
*  and people who helped others to get into the Capitol building. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=455.62s)]
*  You're not charging everyone who was there that day. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=459.74s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=462.94000000000005s)]
*  We have turned down hundreds of cases where the FBI is saying, there is evidence here, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=463.94000000000005s)]
*  it's your determination, prosecutors, whether you think this should be prosecuted. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=468.04s)]
*  And why would you turn them down? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=471.62s)]
*  Because they don't fit within the guidelines that the career prosecutors have been using, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=473.3s)]
*  or we don't think that there's sufficient evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=476.78000000000003s)]
*  doubt. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=480.34000000000003s)]
*  U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves told us that January 6 charges range from essentially trespassing [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=481.34s)]
*  to the most serious, seditious conspiracy. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=488.52s)]
*  So seditious conspiracy is a Civil War-era statute that deals with basically using force [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=493.0s)]
*  against the government to interfere with the operations of the government. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=500.79999999999995s)]
*  Fourteen have been convicted of seditious conspiracy. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=505.96s)]
*  One, a militia leader, got 22 years, the longest sentence of all. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=509.4s)]
*  All of the trials have been in open court in Washington before judges or juries the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=515.64s)]
*  defendant's choice. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=521.9s)]
*  But more than 900, 80 percent, have pleaded guilty. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=523.84s)]
*  And we've seen defendants since January 6 take full advantage of all the protections [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=528.9s)]
*  afforded under the Constitution. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=534.36s)]
*  To me, that's the picture of due process. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=535.8s)]
*  But due process is not the picture painted at Trump rallies, including this last March. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=540.24s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the horribly and unfairly treated January 6th [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=546.52s)]
*  Tostiges. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=554.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, say can you see... [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  That's a recording of defendants in jail. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=561.92s)]
*  Mr. Trump has said that he's inclined to pardon many of them. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=565.64s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=569.76s)]
*  And you see the spirit from the hostages, and that's what they are, is hostages. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  They've been treated terribly and very unfairly. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=576.76s)]
*  And you know that, and everybody knows that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  And we're going to be working on that soon. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  The first day we get into office, we're going to save our country, and we're going to work [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=584.48s)]
*  with the people to treat those unbelievable patriots, and they were unbelievable patriots, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=589.72s)]
*  and are. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=596.8s)]
*  The former president has also revised the history of those who died. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=597.8s)]
*  One of his supporters was killed by an officer defending the House chamber. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=605.76s)]
*  Three other Trump supporters died that day. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=610.68s)]
*  One drug overdose. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=613.68s)]
*  Two from cardiovascular disease. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=615.1999999999999s)]
*  And a police officer died of a stroke the next day. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=618.28s)]
*  In the debate, Mr. Trump acknowledged one death. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=623.0799999999999s)]
*  But he said this in August. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=627.68s)]
*  When you compare him to other things that took place in this country where a lot of [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=630.1999999999999s)]
*  people were killed, nobody was killed on January 6th. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=633.0799999999999s)]
*  Former President Trump is himself a January 6th defendant in a separate prosecution led [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=636.0799999999999s)]
*  by special counsel Jack Smith. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=642.0s)]
*  Trump was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly conspiring to overturn the election with lies [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=644.8s)]
*  he knew were false. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=651.76s)]
*  The same myths that stoked rage in Jared Hughes. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=653.56s)]
*  Where were you getting all this information? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, a lot of Fox News, a lot of stuff that I read on the Internet. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=660.08s)]
*  Obviously, Trump himself, you know, saying that the election was stolen. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=664.52s)]
*  Fox News paid $787 million to settle a suit that claimed that Fox repeatedly lied about [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=669.24s)]
*  the election and knew it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=677.64s)]
*  Were the January 6 protesters duped? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=680.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=684.9599999999999s)]
*  Thomas Griffith is a conservative retired federal judge who co-authored Lost Not Stolen, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=687.9599999999999s)]
*  a year-long investigation by conservatives into the 2020 election. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=695.88s)]
*  The conclusion of the report was that there's no evidence that fraud changed the outcome [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=701.76s)]
*  of an election in any precinct in the United States of America. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=710.04s)]
*  In any precinct? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=714.64s)]
*  And all of the evidence, not the speculation, not the conspiracy theories, all the evidence [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=716.3s)]
*  points in one direction, and that is that President Biden won and President Trump lost. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=722.12s)]
*  Judge Griffith was appointed by George W. Bush to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=730.64s)]
*  Circuit. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=735.24s)]
*  He retired in 2020 after working for years with most of the 29 judges who have heard [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=736.24s)]
*  January 6 cases. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=743.6s)]
*  None of these judges is politically biased. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=745.8s)]
*  These defendants had every chance in the world to defend themselves against these [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=750.4s)]
*  charges and they didn't succeed. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=755.48s)]
*  You seem to be saying that justice was done. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=759.36s)]
*  Absolutely justice was done. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=761.68s)]
*  Justice for Jared Hughes meant turning himself in and pleading guilty to obstruction of an [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=764.52s)]
*  official proceeding. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=769.92s)]
*  The Supreme Court struck down that charge in another case, but if Hughes appeals, he'll [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=771.92s)]
*  face other charges that prosecutors dropped. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=777.8s)]
*  So after 20 months in custody, including prison, he's decided to just wrap up his last days [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=781.4s)]
*  of home detention. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=787.76s)]
*  If I come to find out that I was dead wrong on this, that the election was actually legit [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=788.76s)]
*  and Joe Biden got the most votes in presidential history, I would be extremely embarrassed. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=793.0799999999999s)]
*  I would hold my hand up and say I was wrong and I was an idiot. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=798.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't believe that though. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=801.2399999999999s)]
*  Whether I was right or wrong, I believe what we did was patriotic because we truly believe [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=803.16s)]
*  that the election was stolen for a number of reasons. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=809.16s)]
*  We really believe that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=811.24s)]
*  Though the vote count was delayed, the transfer of power was on time with a new president [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=813.4s)]
*  emerging from that same west front tunnel defended by Officer Daniel Hodges. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=819.16s)]
*  If these defendants are pardoned, then so much of what they believe or believed on that [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=826.52s)]
*  day will be justified in their heads that if they do it again, that they'll be protected [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=833.68s)]
*  and it would be just incredibly destructive for the fabric of the country. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=841.56s)]
*  Now, the trials themselves will be judged by voters who will decide whether the defendants [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=846.44s)]
*  were prosecuted as criminals or choir boys. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=857.0400000000001s)]
*  The allegation is made that the White House is guiding your work. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=865.0400000000001s)]
*  I've never met President Biden, let alone talked to him, which is normal, I would add, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=869.12s)]
*  because there are walls for very good reasons between the Department of Justice and the [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=873.92s)]
*  White House so that prosecution can focus on what it should be focused on, whether there [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=877.88s)]
*  are violations of law and whether those violations of law consistent with the rules that we follow [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=884.04s)]
*  should be federally prosecuted. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=889.12s)]
*  There are people, maybe millions of people in this country who are skeptical about what [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=890.88s)]
*  you just said. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=895.4799999999999s)]
*  No one is being prosecuted for their views. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=896.76s)]
*  They're being prosecuted for their acts. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=899.1999999999999s)]
*  If there's going to be a military conflict between the United States and China, the thinking [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=903.92s)]
*  in Washington goes it will most likely happen if China tries to invade Taiwan. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=913.52s)]
*  But lately, tensions have escalated precariously in another part of the South China Sea, the [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=918.88s)]
*  waters off the western coast of the Philippines, where an international tribunal ruled the [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=924.1999999999999s)]
*  Philippines has exclusive economic rights. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=928.8s)]
*  But China claims almost all of the South China Sea, one of the world's most vital waterways [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=932.24s)]
*  through which more than $3 trillion in goods flow each year. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=937.4s)]
*  To assert its claims, China has been using tactics just short of war, leading to violent [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=941.82s)]
*  confrontations. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=947.08s)]
*  The United States has a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines, which could mean American [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=948.58s)]
*  intervention. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=953.64s)]
*  It's been called the most dangerous conflict no one is talking about, and last month we [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=954.64s)]
*  saw for ourselves just how dangerous it can be. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=959.64s)]
*  When we boarded the Philippine Coast Guard ship Cape Engano last month, it was supposed [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=968.84s)]
*  to be for a routine mission resupplying ships and stations in the South China Sea. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=975.12s)]
*  But in the middle of our first night, sirens raged. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=981.24s)]
*  Crew members rushed between decks. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=987.6s)]
*  It's four in the morning. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  We've all been sound asleep. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=991.32s)]
*  This alarm just went on on the ship. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=992.32s)]
*  We were told to wake up and put our life jackets on because we've just been rammed by a Chinese [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=994.52s)]
*  boat. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=999.2s)]
*  There was confusion, fear. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1000.52s)]
*  Our team was told to stay inside the cabin for safety. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1002.82s)]
*  It was unclear if we would take on water or if the Chinese would try to force their way [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1006.6s)]
*  on board. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1011.16s)]
*  Philippine crew members prepared for that possibility and stood by the hatch holding [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1012.92s)]
*  clubs in case they had to fend off the Chinese. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1016.98s)]
*  This cell phone video taken by the Filipinos shows the moment just after impact. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1021.4s)]
*  The Chinese Coast Guard ship, 269 feet long and nearly twice the size of the Cape Engano, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1026.36s)]
*  jammed into the Philippines starboard quarter, the rear right side of the ship. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1033.2s)]
*  When the Chinese pulled away, the Filipinos found a three and a half foot hole. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1038.6s)]
*  An officer told us we were lucky the damage was above the water line. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1046.22s)]
*  There are, you can't see here in the dark, about four or five different Chinese boats [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1051.28s)]
*  surrounding us at the moment. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1055.48s)]
*  And the crew tells me they can see on the radar that more are coming right now. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1056.76s)]
*  This happened about 60 nautical miles off the coast of the Philippines and about 660 [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1061.32s)]
*  nautical miles from China on the way to a place called Sabina Shoal. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1066.84s)]
*  Manila and Beijing have stationed Coast Guard vessels around the Shoal in recent months, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1071.48s)]
*  with the Philippines fearing China will take control. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1076.1599999999999s)]
*  In 2016, an international tribunal at The Hague ruled the Philippines has exclusive [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1080.28s)]
*  economic rights in a 200-mile zone that includes Sabina Shoal and the area where the Cape Engano [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1085.3s)]
*  was rammed. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1091.78s)]
*  China does not recognize the ruling and says the South China Sea has been its territory [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1093.6s)]
*  since ancient times. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1098.48s)]
*  We're just getting our first light and now we have a much better sense of just how surrounded [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1100.8799999999999s)]
*  we are by Chinese vessels. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1104.6s)]
*  You can see these two right here actually say China Coast Guard. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1106.3999999999999s)]
*  We're at a complete standoff. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1110.32s)]

*  It's unclear whether we can even turn around and go back. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1114.48s)]
*  If we wanted to, we're just completely surrounded by Chinese ships. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1117.54s)]
*  Fourteen in all, including a militia of large fishing vessels used to help occupy territory [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1121.88s)]
*  and block ships like the one we were on. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1127.8400000000001s)]
*  The Filipinos tried to negotiate a way out, but ultimately were forced to abandon the [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1131.2s)]
*  first stop of their mission. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1137.0s)]
*  They said we're not going to Sabina. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1138.48s)]
*  In their damaged boat, they had to take a long detour to their next supply drop as Chinese [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1143.0800000000002s)]
*  ships followed closely. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1148.5600000000002s)]
*  By this time, the Chinese had already publicized their version of the incident, accusing the [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1151.68s)]
*  Filipinos of instigating the conflict and highlighting our team's faces, accusing us [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1156.3600000000001s)]
*  of being part of a propaganda campaign. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1162.2s)]
*  The Philippines has turned the South China Sea into its theater, deliberately ramming [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1164.88s)]
*  a Chinese Coast Guard ship with Western journalists right there to capture the drama. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1168.88s)]
*  They're saying that this is your fault, this collision. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1173.8400000000001s)]
*  If you do the ramming, the other ship would have the damage, not your ship. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1177.48s)]
*  Can they fix that? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1182.48s)]
*  Captain Daniel Labay, the top-ranking officer on the Cape in Gano, took us below deck to [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1184.0s)]
*  survey the damage. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1189.48s)]
*  He told us it would not stop them from continuing on. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  This is our place, this is our exclusive economic zone. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1194.8s)]
*  This is the Philippines. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1198.68s)]
*  Over the past two years, the Chinese have turned the South China Sea into a demolition [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1202.24s)]
*  derby, repeatedly ramming Philippine ships and blasting them with water cannons. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1207.04s)]
*  But what we saw on the Cape in Gano represented a significant escalation, bringing the battle [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1218.52s)]
*  lines closer than ever to the Philippine shore. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1224.36s)]
*  Within hours of the collision, the Biden administration condemned China for what it called [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1227.44s)]
*  dangerous and destabilizing conduct. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1232.24s)]
*  This has become an international incident, what happened on your ship this morning. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1234.8400000000001s)]
*  I've been assigned here for two years, and this is just what we deal with every day. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1239.4s)]
*  Is it getting worse now? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1245.16s)]
*  Yes, it's getting worse. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1246.56s)]
*  What's behind this uptick in tension? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1249.2s)]
*  What changed? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1252.76s)]
*  I think what changed is the determination of the Philippines to say no. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1253.76s)]
*  You're standing up to China? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1258.64s)]
*  Yes, and they don't like it. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1260.28s)]
*  Gilberto Teodoro is the Philippine Secretary of National Defense. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1262.4399999999998s)]
*  The proverbial schoolyard bully is the best example of what China is. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1267.0s)]
*  You know, it just muscles you over. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1272.04s)]
*  For example, he says, the aptly named Mischief Reef in the Philippines' economic zone once [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1275.9199999999998s)]
*  looked like this. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1281.76s)]
*  It now looks like this. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1283.32s)]
*  In the 1990s, the Chinese took it over and started turning the reef into a military base. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1285.72s)]
*  Speed, sir, 6.5 knots. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1291.88s)]
*  As the Cape and Gano passed near Mischief Reef, a Chinese Navy destroyer appeared. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1294.6000000000001s)]
*  China Navy warship 105, this is MRV 4411. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1300.28s)]
*  The Filipinos repeatedly asked for safe passage. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1304.88s)]
*  Please keep clear of our passage and maintain safe distance. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1308.3600000000001s)]
*  Over. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1311.76s)]
*  Each time, there was no response. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1312.76s)]
*  In a game of cat and mouse, the destroyer edged forward, the Filipinos forced to come [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1315.18s)]
*  to a stop and adjust course to avoid another collision. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1320.66s)]
*  China has decided that at this point in their history, they are large enough so that they [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1325.18s)]
*  can buck the law. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1328.68s)]
*  In Manila, we met retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Ray Powell, who runs the nonprofit Sea Light, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1330.14s)]
*  which tracks China's actions in the South China Sea. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1337.98s)]
*  How do they get away with this? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1341.54s)]
*  There's a law and there's a judge, but there's no enforcer, there's no prosecutor, there's [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1343.22s)]
*  nobody to put them in jail. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1346.9s)]
*  Unless I suppose the U.S. decides to intervene, which then becomes the world policeman? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1348.9s)]
*  You know, that's the problem. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1352.66s)]
*  The U.S. is bound by treaty to defend the Philippines if it comes under armed attack. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1355.8600000000001s)]
*  I want to understand a scenario in which that red line could be crossed. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1360.98s)]
*  You were just involved in a situation where you were hit by a larger ship. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1365.5s)]
*  Imagine if that ship had sunk your ship and several people had died. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1370.34s)]
*  What would the Philippines then feel compelled to do? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1375.9399999999998s)]
*  They probably wouldn't go instantly to war, but they might instantly get onto a war footing. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1379.06s)]
*  They might go to the United States and say, this looks a lot like an armed attack to us. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1383.3s)]
*  We were hit by a ship and people died. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1388.12s)]
*  And in a scenario like that, would the United States be obligated to intervene? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1390.3799999999999s)]
*  Look, every treaty in the end depends on the political will of the parties. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1395.6200000000001s)]
*  What I will say is if the United States fails or appears to fail to meet its treaty obligations, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1401.02s)]
*  the entire U.S. treaty and alliance and treaty structure is built on credibility. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1407.3000000000002s)]
*  Your word means nothing. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1412.5s)]
*  If it means nothing to the Philippines, what does it mean to Japan? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1413.8200000000002s)]
*  What does it mean to Australia? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1416.7s)]
*  What does it mean to NATO? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1417.74s)]
*  The U.S. has not had a permanent military presence in the Philippines since 1992, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1421.18s)]
*  though it does conduct regular joint exercises. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1427.42s)]
*  And this year committed $500 million in military aid to Manila [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1430.9s)]
*  and another $128 million to upgrade bases. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1436.38s)]
*  We met General Romeo Bronner, the military chief of staff, at one of those bases [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1442.22s)]
*  after he landed in his fighter jet following an aerial reconnaissance flight over the South China Sea. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1447.14s)]
*  How much time do you spend focused on China? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1455.6200000000001s)]
*  Almost the whole day. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1459.0600000000002s)]
*  Last year, General Bronner visited the Philippines' equivalent of the Alamo, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1460.6200000000001s)]
*  a grounded World War II battleship called the Sierra Madre, manned by soldiers [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1464.9s)]
*  and used to hold down Manila's claim to a disputed area in the South China Sea. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1470.14s)]
*  It was the scene of the most violent incident to date. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1475.38s)]
*  In June, when the Philippine Navy tried to resupply those troops, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1482.18s)]
*  the Chinese blocked the delivery. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1486.22s)]
*  It was near hand-to-hand combat. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1490.3400000000001s)]
*  What was surprising was that they had bladed weapons with them. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1494.3000000000002s)]
*  They had spears with them. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1498.0600000000002s)]
*  You had never seen that before? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1500.0200000000002s)]
*  We have not seen that before. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1501.0600000000002s)]
*  And they began attacking our boats. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1502.74s)]
*  They started puncturing our boats with their spears. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1506.54s)]
*  A Filipino Navy SEAL lost his right thumb after the Chinese rammed his boat. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1513.54s)]
*  They stole our equipment. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1518.98s)]
*  They destroyed our equipment. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1521.66s)]
*  They hurt our personnel. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1523.7s)]
*  And these are the doings of pirates. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1525.74s)]
*  I warned our personnel, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1528.7s)]
*  if this happens again, you have the right to defend yourselves. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1530.5s)]
*  If the Chinese were to fire upon your men, and your men fire back, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1534.46s)]
*  sir, that sounds like the makings of the beginning of a war. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1539.1s)]
*  Yes. Yes, indeed. Indeed. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1541.94s)]
*  Defense Secretary Teodoro told us there are ongoing conversations [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1546.06s)]
*  between Washington and Manila about which scenarios would trigger U.S. involvement. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1550.22s)]
*  Do you worry that perhaps some unpredictable incident at sea [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1555.7s)]
*  could cause tensions to escalate, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1560.42s)]
*  and then suddenly the Philippines, not Taiwan, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1562.94s)]
*  becomes the flashpoint in the South China Sea? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1566.1000000000001s)]
*  Oh, yes. Oh, yes, definitely. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1567.98s)]
*  If China were to take the Sierra Madre, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1570.02s)]
*  would that merit America's intervention? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1572.22s)]
*  If China were to take the Sierra Madre, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1575.1000000000001s)]
*  that is a clear act of war on a Philippine vessel. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1577.7s)]
*  And you would expect American intervention? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1580.22s)]
*  We will react. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1581.46s)]
*  And naturally, we would expect it. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1583.02s)]
*  You're talking about a rusty old warship. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1586.58s)]
*  How realistic is it to expect the United States to intervene [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1590.22s)]
*  over the fate of a warship like that? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1593.82s)]
*  There are people in there. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1596.06s)]
*  That is an outpost of Philippine sovereignty. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1597.82s)]
*  So we're not talking about a rusty old vessel solely. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1600.38s)]
*  We're talking about a piece of Philippine territory in there. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1603.58s)]
*  President Biden has invited Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1607.86s)]
*  to the White House twice in the past 16 months [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1612.06s)]
*  and assured him of America's support. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1615.26s)]
*  I want to be very clear. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1617.9399999999998s)]
*  The United States defense commitment to the Philippines is ironclad. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1619.4199999999998s)]
*  Earlier this year, Washington sent the Philippines [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1624.82s)]
*  a powerful weapon during joint exercises, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1627.74s)]
*  a mid-range missile system capable of reaching mainland China. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1631.3s)]
*  That clearly angered China in a big way. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1635.7s)]
*  That's none of their business. This is for Philippine defense. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1639.14s)]
*  It's none of China's business that you have a missile [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1641.5s)]
*  that could reach their shores? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1643.98s)]
*  What happens within our territory, it is for our defense. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1645.3400000000001s)]
*  We follow international law. What's the fuss? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1648.9s)]
*  Do you plan to keep mid-range missiles capable of reaching mainland China [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1652.7s)]
*  at some of your bases? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1656.6200000000001s)]
*  I can neither confirm nor deny if there is such a plan. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1658.02s)]
*  You say, what's the fuss? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1664.54s)]
*  China says that you've brought the risk of war into the region by doing this. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1667.42s)]
*  That's what they always say. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1670.78s)]
*  Everything the world does that they don't like is the fault of the world. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1672.8999999999999s)]
*  How do you think this ends, though? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1679.22s)]
*  You don't expect China to pack up and leave, do you? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1681.26s)]
*  I really don't know. The end state. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1685.3s)]
*  All I know is that we cannot let them get away with what they're doing. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1688.22s)]
*  Another one over here. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1695.54s)]
*  What was it like being on board during an international incident at sea? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1696.74s)]
*  The intimidation is very real when you see it up close. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1700.82s)]
*  At 60minutesovertime.com. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1703.82s)]
*  Plenty of teenagers want to become pop stars, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1714.46s)]
*  but few convince their parents to let them pack their bags [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1717.02s)]
*  and move to another country to try and make it big. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1720.3s)]
*  That's what Dua Lipa did when she was just 15 years old. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1723.5s)]
*  She'd taken some singing lessons, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1727.06s)]
*  but didn't know anything about the business of making music. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1728.6200000000001s)]
*  Turns out she's a quick study. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1732.14s)]
*  At 29, she's now one of the top female recording artists in the world. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1734.38s)]
*  Take a look at what happened in June [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1738.82s)]
*  when she headlined Britain's biggest music festival, Glastonbury. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1740.94s)]
*  She was singing one of the first songs she released nine years ago. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1744.7s)]
*  Back then, hardly anyone knew who Dua Lipa was. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1748.06s)]
*  But at Glastonbury, 100,000 people came to see her. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1751.58s)]
*  They sang along to her every word. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1755.6999999999998s)]
*  Glastonbury, as loud as you can, come on! [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1759.1s)]
*  I'm gonna be the one! [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1761.7s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1764.42s)]
*  One more time, louder! [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1766.1s)]
*  I'm gonna be the one! [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1768.1s)]
*  I love you guys, you're making my dreams come true. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1769.94s)]
*  Louder! [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1772.3s)]
*  I'm gonna be the one! [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1773.3s)]
*  Be the one, be the one, be the one, be the one, be the one, be the one. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1774.86s)]
*  I'm gonna be the one. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1778.9s)]
*  It's unbelievable seeing that many people sing back at you. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1780.1s)]
*  Will you be mine? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1783.14s)]
*  I couldn't believe that it was happening in that moment, you know? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1789.22s)]
*  I'd dreamt about being on that stage my whole life. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1793.0200000000002s)]
*  I'd thought about it, I'd wished it. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1796.42s)]
*  You'd envisioned it. I'd envisioned it so many times. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1798.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh, baby, come on, let me get to know you [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1801.5400000000002s)]
*  Just another chance so that I can show that I won't let you down [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1804.1000000000001s)]
*  I had written down, I want to headline, Glastonbury, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1808.74s)]
*  on the pyramid stage, on the Friday night. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1812.58s)]
*  Being very specific about the Friday night so I could party afterwards. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1814.98s)]
*  Wait a minute, so even in your dream, it was due Friday night so you could stay at Glastonbury? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1818.98s)]
*  So I could stay Saturday, Sunday. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1822.7s)]
*  And go out dancing and be in the crowds. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1824.3400000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1826.3s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1827.74s)]
*  You know, you've got to be specific about your dreams, you know? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1828.9s)]
*  Dua Lipa isn't afraid to admit she enjoys a good time. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1834.14s)]
*  And that's what her music is all about. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1843.46s)]
*  The songs are fun and flirtatious. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1846.46s)]
*  She sings of boy breakups and girl power. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1855.46s)]
*  Late nights and dark clubs. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1861.46s)]
*  It is pure pop, and Dua Lipa's got no problem with that. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1866.46s)]
*  You're always met with some kind of pushback as a female artist. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1872.46s)]
*  If you're not like, with a guitar or with a piano, just like, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1877.46s)]
*  oh she can't sing, oh it's all processed, or what's this, or what's whatever. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1881.46s)]
*  I just think there's just like a stigma around pop music. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1885.46s)]
*  But that was the music which you wanted to do from the beginning. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1888.46s)]
*  Because I loved it. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1891.46s)]
*  That's the music that makes me get up and dance. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1892.46s)]
*  Don't let the laid back demeanor fool you. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1896.46s)]
*  Dua Lipa has worked hard and come a long way to make all this look easy. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1902.46s)]
*  Dua, whose name means love in Albanian, was born in London. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1912.46s)]
*  Her parents had moved there from Kosovo after the war in Bosnia broke out in 1992. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1916.46s)]
*  She started singing lessons at nine, but her family returned to Kosovo when she was 11. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1921.46s)]
*  Four years later, she decided to go back to Britain and try and become a pop star. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1926.46s)]
*  That was the plan? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1932.46s)]
*  That was the plan, always. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1933.46s)]
*  The pitch to your parents was, in order to go to a British university, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1934.46s)]
*  I need to go to high school. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1938.46s)]
*  Yes, that was the initial pitch. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1940.46s)]
*  Her father, Duka Jean Lipa, is now her manager. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1942.46s)]
*  Did you buy that pitch? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1945.46s)]
*  Of course we did. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1946.46s)]
*  She was always very mature. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1947.46s)]
*  Even at 15? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1949.46s)]
*  Even at 15. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1950.46s)]
*  And yeah, it is a little bit crazy saying, like, oh, 15 years old, she persuaded you to let her go. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1951.46s)]
*  But her maturity and our relationship was... [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1957.46s)]
*  You knew she could handle it? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1961.46s)]
*  Of course. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1962.46s)]
*  It sounds like you were a very confident 15-year-old. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1963.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think more confident than I am now, for sure. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1966.46s)]
*  Really? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1969.46s)]
*  I think I was more confident than I am now. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1970.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think more confident than I am now, for sure. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1973.46s)]
*  I'm Dua, I'm 15 years old, and I'm going to be singing Super Duper Love by Justin. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1977.46s)]
*  In London, she immediately started recording herself singing covers of her favorite artists [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1984.46s)]
*  and putting the videos on YouTube. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1989.46s)]
*  This is one of the first ones she made in 2011. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1995.46s)]
*  She was living with a family friend, but was pretty much on her own. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=1998.46s)]
*  She skipped school so often, she flunked out. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2002.46s)]
*  Basically, I got expelled, and I remember calling my parents, and they're like, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2006.46s)]
*  okay, well, you did this, find yourself a school, or you're going to come back to Kosovo. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2011.46s)]
*  She did find another high school and graduated, but decided college could wait. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2020.46s)]
*  Her cover songs online had gotten some notice, and just three years after leaving Kosovo, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2025.46s)]
*  18-year-old Dua Lipa got a record deal with Warner Brothers. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2030.46s)]
*  I walked in with a dream of I want to sing, I want to perform, I want to write. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2049.46s)]
*  But I had no idea of what comes with it or what other things I have to do, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2054.46s)]
*  or even what goes into the promotion of a record. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2061.46s)]
*  While working on her first album, she began releasing singles and performing wherever she could. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2070.46s)]
*  We were doing really small shows where the stage was like a step above the floor. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2075.46s)]
*  So how many people liked your first performances? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2081.46s)]
*  About 10. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2084.46s)]
*  10? Wow. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2085.46s)]
*  About 10. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2087.46s)]
*  And how many were friends and family? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2088.46s)]
*  Well, none, but they all got offered a drink to come and watch. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2090.46s)]
*  So that was how we got them to come and watch. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2093.46s)]
*  It's like puppet shows in the final taz. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2096.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2098.46s)]
*  That all changed in 2017 when her first album came out, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2100.46s)]
*  and she made this music video in a hotel in Miami for a song called New Rules. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2104.46s)]
*  It became her first major hit in America. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2113.46s)]
*  The song was called, I Don't Want To Be Alone, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2120.46s)]
*  and it was the song that made her debut in 2017. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2123.46s)]
*  It became her first major hit in America. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2126.46s)]
*  The album would earn Dua Lipa two Grammys, one of them for Best New Artist. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2133.46s)]
*  When she sang New Rules at the Brit Awards on live TV in 2018, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2142.46s)]
*  the reviews were positive, but some viewers' comments online weren't. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2146.46s)]
*  One in particular went viral. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2150.46s)]
*  The comment was from somebody that said, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2153.46s)]
*  I love her lack of energy, go girl, give us nothing. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2155.46s)]
*  You remembered the words. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2158.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2160.46s)]
*  It just spread like wildfire that I had no stage presence or I couldn't perform. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2161.46s)]
*  So I was like, all right, well, I'm just going to prove to you [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2166.46s)]
*  that I can perform and I can dance and I can do all these things. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2171.46s)]
*  Dua Lipa may have wanted to prove her doubters wrong, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2175.46s)]
*  but when her second album, called Future Nostalgia, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2178.46s)]
*  was ready to be released two years later, the timing could not have been worse. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2181.46s)]
*  My second album came out in March 2020 at the very beginning of the pandemic. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2185.46s)]
*  Was there any talk of delaying? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2192.46s)]
*  Yeah, there was, but because I had spent so long working on it, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2194.46s)]
*  I was like, this album has to come out. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2198.46s)]
*  With much of the world locked down, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2201.46s)]
*  it wasn't clear if anyone would want to listen to dance songs [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2203.46s)]
*  or how she could even promote the album. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2206.46s)]
*  My whole idea was that this is a record that's supposed to be played in the clubs. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2209.46s)]
*  I envisioned myself in the club. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2212.46s)]
*  In the producing of it, the whole thing is like you're in the club. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2214.46s)]
*  Dua, how are you? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2218.46s)]
*  Good, how are you? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2220.46s)]
*  Three days after the album's release, she gamely appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2221.46s)]
*  Her home had flooded and she was renting a small studio apartment. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2226.46s)]
*  Don't start now. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2230.46s)]
*  Oh my God, and I was having really a bad hair day. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2233.46s)]
*  Everyone coming together in their living rooms and their kitchens to make this happen. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2247.46s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2251.46s)]
*  I love that you were in some random apartment. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2256.46s)]
*  Yeah, so you can see from there how close I am to the cupboards above, the oven and the stove top. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2258.46s)]
*  This is you kicking off the release globally of your album. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2268.46s)]
*  Globally of my album. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2271.46s)]
*  The new album was an extraordinary success, commercially and critically. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2274.46s)]
*  Billboard, Rolling Stone and others called it one of the best of the year, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2279.46s)]
*  and Dua Lipa was dubbed the quarantine queen. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2283.46s)]
*  It worked out in a weird way. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2286.46s)]
*  Yeah, it did. It didn't end up being the nightclub experience, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2289.46s)]
*  but it ended up being the kitchen dance parties and the soundtrack to people's workouts at home [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2294.46s)]
*  to kind of keep them sane during that time. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2300.46s)]
*  It also gave people the fantasy of being out in the club. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2304.46s)]
*  Being out, I hope so. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2307.46s)]
*  In May, she released her third album called Radical Optimism [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2308.46s)]
*  and is now rehearsing for a year-long tour in 28 countries. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2311.46s)]
*  I'm still getting my timing while I'm rehearsing. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2316.46s)]
*  Those first beginning notes, the, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, they're really fast. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2319.46s)]
*  So I just have to practice to make sure that I don't slow the song down and miss my timing. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2325.46s)]
*  In just nine years of releasing music, Dua Lipa has reached a level of success even she never imagined. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2339.46s)]
*  Her songs have been streamed by fans more than 45 billion times. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2352.46s)]
*  I saw some writers who said that in your songs, they don't have a sense of who you are. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2358.46s)]
*  You're not pouring out your innermost fears and desires and wants. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2364.46s)]
*  It's something that I just naturally hold back. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2370.46s)]
*  Some people are just so ruthless with their own private life that they decide to put it all out in a song [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2374.46s)]
*  because they know that it's gonna attract people's attention. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2382.46s)]
*  And for me, it was always important to make music that people really loved, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2387.46s)]
*  not because I was putting someone out on blast or not because I'm doing it for the clickbait, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2394.46s)]
*  but maybe someone else's expense. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2401.46s)]
*  Dua Lipa's music may not be controversial, but some statements she's made over the past few years about Israel have been. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2404.46s)]
*  She's called the current war in Gaza genocide, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2411.46s)]
*  and in 2021, a well-known rabbi took out this full page ad in the New York Times criticizing her. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2414.46s)]
*  There was a lot of words kind of thrown at me, things that I don't believe represent who I am or what I believe in at all. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2421.46s)]
*  Like I've always only ever wanted peace, really. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2429.46s)]
*  It's devastating what's happening over there. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2433.46s)]
*  There's bombs happening between both Israel and Palestine and children are dying [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2436.46s)]
*  and families are being separated and it's just devastating to sit back and see it happen. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2442.46s)]
*  Some people are saying, what, you said it was anti-Semitic? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2449.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And it's just not, I think it was very unfairly treated by the times. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2451.46s)]
*  Did that experience make you reticent to be outspoken again? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2458.46s)]
*  No, because it hasn't stopped me from talking about things that I believe in. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2464.46s)]
*  Whatever Dua Lipa's political or personal opinions may be, for now you won't find them in her music. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2469.46s)]
*  She wants that to be something that will help lift you up, get you out, and maybe, just maybe, take a spin on the dance floor. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2481.46s)]
*  The Last Minute of 60 Minutes is sponsored by UnitedHealthcare. Reliable coverage for your whole life ahead. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2499.46s)]
*  Next Sunday on 60 Minutes, an investigation every American should see. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2511.46s)]
*  The head of the Drug Enforcement Administration calls the fentanyl crisis the greatest threat we face as a country. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2516.46s)]
*  They make it into these fake pills that look identical to pharmaceutical drugs that Americans would recognize, like Oxy or Xanax, Percocet, Adderall. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2524.46s)]
*  It will be a very massive high that is very short. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2534.46s)]
*  And that person, they're betting, if they survive, will come back again and again and again to buy more. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2538.46s)]
*  So these two drug cartels from our neighbor, from Mexico, are responsible for almost 70,000 American deaths a year? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2546.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2558.46s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQAyw9seeA&t=2560.46s)]
