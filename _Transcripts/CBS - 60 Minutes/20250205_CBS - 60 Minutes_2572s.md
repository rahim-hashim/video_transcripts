# What Will Mitch Do?; Robert Lighthizer; A Psychedelic Journey | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o)
*  How do you feel about the Senate? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=0.0s)]
*  Glad to be in the majority. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  At age 82 and after 18 years as the longest serving Senate leader ever, Mitch McConnell [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=9.84s)]
*  is thinking about his legacy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=16.36s)]
*  And that includes his long-running feud with President Trump. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=18.76s)]
*  You have said some pretty harsh things about him. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=22.84s)]
*  You said he's nasty. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=26.64s)]
*  You said he's not very smart. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=27.64s)]
*  You said he's a sleazeball. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=29.56s)]
*  Well, those were private comments. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=31.16s)]
*  Well, but they're in your biography. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=36.12s)]
*  You add it all up. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=39.12s)]
*  You can get to around a trillion dollars a year of wealth from the United States being [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=40.56s)]
*  transferred through a geopolitical adversary. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=48.2s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  You don't know Robert Lighthizer, but his influence with President Trump could change [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  America's economy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=57.0s)]
*  He's an evangelist for trade tariffs, which he says might just save the country. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=58.8s)]
*  The way you paint it, it seems like tariffs are magic. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=65.24s)]
*  The vets drank psilocybin, a psychoactive compound found in some mushrooms, put on blindfolds [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  to shut out distractions and lay down. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=77.64s)]
*  The retreat was organized and paid for by the Heroic Hearts Project, a nonprofit that's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=80.8s)]
*  helped more than a thousand U.S. veterans with combat-related PTSD access psychedelics. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=85.88s)]
*  Them seeking this type of unauthorized therapy is just another indication on why we need [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  to study this further and get it to a safe and effective medical environment. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=96.88s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=103.44s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=104.96s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=106.28s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=107.52s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=108.91999999999999s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=111.52s)]
*  We'll have those stories tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=113.2s)]
*  After 18 years as the longest-serving Senate leader ever, Mitch McConnell is starting the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=123.76s)]
*  year as a backbencher. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=129.46s)]
*  At 82, he's thinking about his legacy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  He recently cooperated on a book about his life, relinquishing his personal papers to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=135.4s)]
*  the biographer. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=141.04s)]
*  After voting against Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, the question is, how much more [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=143.08s)]
*  will McConnell defy President Donald Trump? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=148.96s)]
*  Everybody wants to know. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=153.0s)]
*  What will Mitch do? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=154.8s)]
*  You have said that you feel liberated, like Martin Luther King, free at last. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=157.08s)]
*  Yeah, well I— [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=163.0s)]
*  Free for what? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  Free to do what? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=165.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, I will be more outspoken about things that I particularly care about than I have [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  been in the past. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=172.2s)]
*  Particularly the resurgence of isolationism in today's Republican Party. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  America First, that's what they used in the 30s. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=179.32s)]
*  And I'm hopeful the new administration will understand and act, not with just language [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  that says America First, but funding that underscores the nature of the threat. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=189.32s)]
*  Look, what is the situation? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  North Korea, China, Russia, Iran. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=199.64s)]
*  This is a huge threat. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  A fight between the autocrats and the democracies. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=206.04s)]
*  And when it comes to the democratic world, only one country can lead. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=210.16s)]
*  That's us. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=214.56s)]
*  That's fundamental to the difference between what you're saying and what this administration [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=215.56s)]
*  seems to be saying, which is, we don't want to be the leader of the free world anymore. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=223.0s)]
*  Well, I can only speak for myself. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=228.48s)]
*  I think it's dangerous to step aside and assume that by speaking to autocrats, they will somehow [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=230.4s)]
*  treat you better. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=238.56s)]
*  What about tariffs against our allies? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  It will drive the cost of everything up. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=244.6s)]
*  In other words, it'll be paid for by American consumers. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=247.44s)]
*  I mean, why would you want to get in a fight with your allies over this? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=251.16s)]
*  What about the encroachment on the independence of the Senate, for example? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=255.6s)]
*  Will you be speaking out about that? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=261.04s)]
*  I sure will. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=262.84s)]
*  When I was in charge of the year and he was president, he tried to get me to change the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=263.84s)]
*  filibuster. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=267.44s)]
*  I said I had a one-word answer, no. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=268.44s)]
*  In the book, it says that you had a couple of screaming matches on the phone with the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=271.64s)]
*  president. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=279.32s)]
*  We had a candid relationship. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=281.8s)]
*  The Trump-McConnell feud has been roiling for a long time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=285.08s)]
*  We do have to do something about Mitch McConnell. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=289.4s)]
*  He's a disaster. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=293.44s)]
*  He's a disaster. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=295.44s)]
*  President Trump called you, among other things, a sullen, unsmiling political hack. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=296.84s)]
*  You have said some pretty harsh things about him. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=304.56s)]
*  You said he's nasty. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=308.36s)]
*  You said he's not very smart. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=309.36s)]
*  You said he's a sleazeball. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=311.28s)]
*  Well, those were private comments. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=313.24s)]
*  Well, but they're in your biography. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=315.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=317.92s)]
*  He vented about Donald Trump to his biographer, Michael Tackett, who interviewed him over [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=318.92s)]
*  the last three years. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  What's the most courageous thing he did as leader? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=326.92s)]
*  The most courageous thing he did as leader was stand up for aid for Ukraine. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=330.36s)]
*  It wasn't popular within his party. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=335.16s)]
*  It wasn't popular with Donald Trump. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't popular with JD Vance, but he did it anyway. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=338.72s)]
*  What's the most despicable thing he did? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=342.44s)]
*  The most contentious thing he did was to block Merrick Garland, not simply from getting a [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=345.84s)]
*  vote in the Senate, but from even having a hearing in the Senate. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=351.32s)]
*  McConnell single-handedly blocked President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=355.44s)]
*  Supreme Court. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=361.44s)]
*  One of my proudest moments is when I looked at Barack Obama in the eye and I said, Mr. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=362.44s)]
*  President, you will not fill this Supreme Court vacancy. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=366.88s)]
*  This was the first step in McConnell's engineering of a conservative supermajority on the Supreme [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=372.24s)]
*  Court. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  What about the way you went about imposing these justices into the system? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=380.06s)]
*  How do you feel as you look back on your legacy? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=386.92s)]
*  I feel fine about it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=390.8s)]
*  I knew that if the shoe was on the other foot... [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=392.16s)]
*  But is that a good reason? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=396.28000000000003s)]
*  They would have done the same thing. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  Your biographer, and I'm quoting him, said it was a brutish exercise of power, brutish. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=399.8s)]
*  I just don't agree. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=407.96000000000004s)]
*  But what do you think about that sort of image of you? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  I decided political popularity was not my motivation. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=415.0s)]
*  I was going to try to help right-of-center America have a voice, and that was what I [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=420.68s)]
*  thought was the most important thing I could do. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=426.48s)]
*  Do you take any responsibility that the court has lost so much credibility? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=430.64s)]
*  There's been a recent poll that says 70% of the American people think that justices are [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=438.32s)]
*  more influenced by ideology than by being fair and impartial. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=449.56s)]
*  The reason their popularity is down is because the Democrats are criticizing them all the time. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=450.56s)]
*  Okay, but I'm not talking about popularity. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=457.36s)]
*  I'm talking about credibility of a major institution. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=460.12s)]
*  But Leslie, their job is not to seek public approval. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=464.72s)]
*  It's to follow the law. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=469.88s)]
*  So this is your beloved Senate. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=472.68s)]
*  How do you feel about the Senate? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=475.26s)]
*  Glad to be in the majority. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=477.28s)]
*  At 82, he has slowed down, looks frail. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=478.92s)]
*  There have been questions about his health ever since he froze at the microphones in [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=483.44s)]
*  the Capitol over a year ago. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=487.96000000000004s)]
*  He told us the freeze was caused by a concussion that he suffered from a fall. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=491.76s)]
*  Seven months later... [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=498.0s)]
*  This will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=499.0s)]
*  When he was leader, his trademark was inscrutability. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=503.48s)]
*  Any comments, Leader McConnell? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=507.44s)]
*  How do you feel today, what? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=508.84s)]
*  I'm not going to answer questions about when. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=509.84s)]
*  He earned the nickname Darth Vader. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=513.32s)]
*  I'm suggesting that I'm not going to answer your question. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=516.48s)]
*  I want to control the message if I can. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=520.92s)]
*  Are you doing that right now? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=523.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=525.76s)]
*  McConnell's has been a long and improbable journey. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=526.76s)]
*  Born in 1942 in rural Alabama, he was stricken with polio at age two. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=531.48s)]
*  His mother drove him to Warm Springs, Georgia to the polio facility established by Franklin [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=538.4s)]
*  Roosevelt. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=544.6s)]
*  The treatment? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=545.6s)]
*  He wasn't allowed to walk for two years. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  I was lucky to have a mother who was absolutely determined to do everything she could to get [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=550.68s)]
*  me back to normal. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=557.16s)]
*  They moved to Louisville, Kentucky, and when Mitch was in high school, he found his niche [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=558.84s)]
*  in student government. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=563.96s)]
*  So he'd been developing his political skills and acumen from the youngest age. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=566.16s)]
*  He was almost born 40 years old in a suit. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=572.4s)]
*  He wanted to be in politics. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=575.0799999999999s)]
*  McConnell mastered the inside game over his 40 years in the Senate, so much so that Tackett [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=577.12s)]
*  says he's the most impactful Senate leader since Lyndon Johnson. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=584.36s)]
*  You can draw a straight line from what he did to shape the courts to the overturning [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=589.56s)]
*  of Roe vs. Wade to the overturning of affirmative action. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=593.58s)]
*  By changing the composition of the court, he changed American life. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=597.38s)]
*  But his job became more difficult as his party became more MAGA, and even worse after President [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=602.5400000000001s)]
*  Trump used a racial slur against his second wife, Elaine Chao. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=609.82s)]
*  Did you ever confront him about what he said about your wife, Elaine? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=615.4000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=619.26s)]
*  I chose not to engage with him. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=620.26s)]
*  And today, you feel okay about that? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=623.54s)]
*  No, I don't feel okay about it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=626.62s)]
*  How would you describe your relationship with President Trump? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=629.24s)]
*  Well, we haven't spoken for quite a while. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=633.54s)]
*  I was very upset about what happened January 6th. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=641.42s)]
*  You had to be evacuated from the Senate along with other leaders. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=651.5s)]
*  Your staff was in your office. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=656.7s)]
*  The rioters were banging on your door. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=660.18s)]
*  Someone with a flagpole broke a window into your office. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=663.36s)]
*  Well, my staff in the Capitol was putting furniture up against the doors. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=666.5s)]
*  To prevent them from coming? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=673.24s)]
*  To prevent the rioters from outside from breaking the doors and getting at them. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=674.44s)]
*  And what was it about? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=683.64s)]
*  To try to prevent the orderly transfer of government, which had never happened in our [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=684.64s)]
*  country. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=691.64s)]
*  Your staff, after the crisis was over, you went and spoke with them. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=692.84s)]
*  It was a highly emotional situation. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=699.48s)]
*  You remember? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=701.8s)]
*  Oh, I remember well. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=703.3599999999999s)]
*  Do you remember what you told them? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=706.3599999999999s)]
*  That, yeah, I remember what I told them. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=708.3599999999999s)]
*  That emotion turned to fury. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=715.8399999999999s)]
*  President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=718.76s)]
*  day. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=727.56s)]
*  That's the way I still feel about it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=728.56s)]
*  What are your views on President Trump and his supporters trying to change what happened [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=730.64s)]
*  on January 6th? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=736.68s)]
*  They're calling it a day of love. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=738.12s)]
*  They call the rioters martyrs. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=741.28s)]
*  Yeah, no, it was an insurrection. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=743.16s)]
*  What about the pardons for the people who stormed the Capitol that day? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=746.28s)]
*  I think pardoning people who've been convicted is a mistake. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=751.68s)]
*  But while he has been critical of the president, he has almost always wound up retracting his [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=759.42s)]
*  clause. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=765.4599999999999s)]
*  Take the impeachment battle. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=766.4599999999999s)]
*  The question is on the article of impeachment. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=768.5799999999999s)]
*  McConnell ended up voting against convicting Mr. Trump at the Senate trial that took place [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=771.2199999999999s)]
*  after he had just left office. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=777.8199999999999s)]
*  A conviction could have disqualified the ex-president from running for reelection. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=780.2199999999999s)]
*  McConnell thought that the criminal and civil justice system would be there to hold Trump [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=785.18s)]
*  to account for his actions. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=789.06s)]
*  And as we know, it didn't happen. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=790.54s)]
*  And partly because of him. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=793.3399999999999s)]
*  The court he created ended up being the court that helped to enable Donald Trump to not [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=794.78s)]
*  eventually face prosecution. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=801.78s)]
*  It was the biggest miscalculation of his political career and no doubt will be a stain on his [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=803.8599999999999s)]
*  legacy. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=809.3s)]
*  So now Donald Trump is president again, issuing an onslaught of executive orders and controversial [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=811.6999999999999s)]
*  nominees for his cabinet. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=818.98s)]
*  McConnell was one of only three Republicans who voted against Pete Hegseth for defense [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=823.0600000000001s)]
*  secretary. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=828.38s)]
*  And while he won't tip his hand on how he'll vote on the others, he did signal some reluctance [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=829.86s)]
*  about the nominee who would oversee the nation's health care system. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=838.26s)]
*  You're a polio survivor. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=842.58s)]
*  There is one of the cabinet nominees, R.F.K. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=845.46s)]
*  Jr., who says that the polio vaccine killed more people than polio. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=850.1800000000001s)]
*  What are your views about that? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=858.9000000000001s)]
*  Well, the polio vaccine, it's been a huge success. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=860.26s)]
*  But what about all of the measles, mumps, I mean, chickenpox? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=864.7s)]
*  No, vaccines are critically important to health, to having normal lives. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=868.9s)]
*  How important is that issue to you? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=877.5s)]
*  You know, we're talking about things you would fight for. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=880.74s)]
*  You're free at last. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=883.34s)]
*  You're free to speak your mind. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=884.9s)]
*  Well, it's no surprise that it's a big deal with me. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=886.9399999999999s)]
*  So what will Mitch do now? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=890.8s)]
*  Will he lead an opposition to the head of his party? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=893.1s)]
*  Not likely. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=896.9s)]
*  I expect to support most of what this administration is trying to accomplish. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=897.9s)]
*  So what happened in the past is irrelevant to me. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=905.26s)]
*  You said that January 6 was evidence of Donald Trump's complete unfitness for office. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=910.18s)]
*  I said shortly after January 6 that if he were the nominee for president, I would support him. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=917.8199999999999s)]
*  Even if he's unfit for office? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=926.54s)]
*  I'm a Republican. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=928.86s)]
*  I don't get to decide who gets to be president. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=931.3s)]
*  The American people do. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=933.86s)]
*  And you have to admit, they did. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=936.18s)]
*  And he's back. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=940.78s)]
*  Senator McConnell's engineering of the Supreme Court. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=946.78s)]
*  He tells his staff, find us some justification for this argument. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=950.14s)]
*  At 60MinutesOvertime.com. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=955.1s)]
*  You don't know Robert Lighthizer, but his influence with President Trump could change [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=962.74s)]
*  America's economy. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=967.86s)]
*  Lighthizer was the top U.S. trade negotiator in the first Trump administration, and he's [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=969.74s)]
*  an evangelist for tariffs, taxes on imported goods. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=975.0600000000001s)]
*  Yesterday, the president declared an emergency and imposed unusually high 25% tariffs on [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=980.1800000000001s)]
*  Mexico and Canada and 10% on China to coerce them to stop the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=987.82s)]
*  That's unusual because tariffs are normally used to balance trade. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=996.62s)]
*  And in Lighthizer's opinion, America has little choice. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1001.74s)]
*  He says China's 3-to-1 dominance in trade is a threat to our way of life. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1005.8s)]
*  China to me is an existential threat to the United States. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1013.64s)]
*  It is a very, very competent adversary. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1019.76s)]

*  They're taking our technology. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1036.3s)]
*  They've been waging an economic war against the United States and winning that war for [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1037.6s)]

*  I believe in strategic decoupling. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1049.58s)]

*  That's not my position at all. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1055.22s)]

*  And how do you get balanced trade? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1059.46s)]
*  You're going to get balanced trade by having large tariffs on most of what they send us. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1061.08s)]
*  What's large? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1066.52s)]
*  You know, the president has floated numbers, 50, 60 percent, but I think there are big [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1067.52s)]
*  numbers like that. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1071.1999999999998s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1072.1999999999998s)]
*  You're talking about decoupling from China. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1073.1999999999998s)]
*  What would that look like? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1075.8s)]
*  So it is strategic decoupling. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1076.8799999999999s)]
*  So we would still have trade. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1078.36s)]
*  So I would say we sell you 150 billion. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1079.74s)]
*  We buy 150 billion from you. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1083.6399999999999s)]

*  We don't allow inbound investments. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1092.42s)]
*  So we begin to disentangle. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1094.28s)]
*  We disentangle our technology. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1095.8000000000002s)]
*  You could ask yourself, what is China's policy towards us? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1098.16s)]
*  It is exactly a mirror image of what I just said. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1102.0800000000002s)]
*  So what I'm suggesting we do to China is what they do to us. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1105.5600000000002s)]

*  But the prices of those domestic goods will also rise because they no longer have to compete [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1471.9399999999998s)]
*  with imported goods. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1476.06s)]

*  Well, I wouldn't say magic. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1602.36s)]
*  Remember, the tariffs are part of an economic policy. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1604.76s)]
*  The policy has tax cuts. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1608.6s)]
*  It has spending cuts. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1611.04s)]
*  It has energy production. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1612.56s)]
*  It has regulatory reduction and it has tariffs. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1614.2s)]
*  The combination of that, I think, and tariffs are an important part of it, has the potential [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1616.76s)]
*  to have this kind of renaissance. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1622.48s)]

*  You know, Belvedere has always fought for themselves. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1654.0s)]
*  And in this scenario, we needed everybody to fight for us. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1657.64s)]
*  And they did. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1667.3200000000002s)]
*  Biden did. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1669.16s)]
*  He increased Trump's earlier 25 percent tariff on Chinese cars to 100 percent for Chinese [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1670.52s)]
*  electric vehicles. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1678.44s)]
*  Then Biden gave carmaker Stellantis a $335 million grant to convert Belvedere to electric [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1680.52s)]
*  cars. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1688.8000000000002s)]

*  So it's not just going to be the tariffs. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1709.1799999999998s)]
*  It's got to be policy that's set for the middle class. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1710.6599999999999s)]

*  So in the long run, I'm afraid it will just increase cynicism among the American public [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1739.82s)]
*  about whether the government is able to deliver and make their lives better. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=1744.6s)]

*  The value what we're finding with psychedelics is it's a very individualistic journey. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2075.76s)]
*  It comes at you, it brings up the emotions, it heightens your senses, and so you're having [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2081.0s)]

*  first two with psilocybin, a psychoactive compound found in some mushrooms. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2110.2s)]
*  It's been used as medicine by indigenous communities in Mexico and elsewhere for centuries. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2115.3599999999997s)]

*  The healers stirred ground-up mushrooms into a tea. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2132.6s)]
*  The vets drank it, put on blindfolds to shut out distractions, and lay down. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2138.26s)]
*  At first it seemed like the group might have traveled thousands of miles for a midday nap. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2146.38s)]
*  But then, about an hour in, we saw Michael Giardina raise his hand for help. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2154.98s)]
*  His foot soon started to shake, followed by his whole body. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2163.4s)]
*  By hour three, it was clear the psilocybin had kicked in. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2177.82s)]
*  Randy Weaver and TJ Duff barely seemed to move, while firefighter Ed Glover appeared [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2181.94s)]
*  caught between rapture and deep sorrow. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2187.36s)]
*  Five hours later, when the psilocybin began to wear off, the vets removed their eye masks [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2203.26s)]
*  and found the heat of the afternoon sun. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2208.28s)]
*  The next day, the group gathered to discuss what they'd gone through. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2212.78s)]
*  It literally felt like an exorcism. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2216.16s)]
*  My foot was going crazy. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2218.28s)]
*  I could kind of feel like my body was convulsing. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2220.7200000000003s)]
*  I felt like I was taking every last breath of any victim, patient, or friend that I had [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2223.32s)]
*  lost. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2228.92s)]
*  So I really struggled to breathe yesterday. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2229.92s)]
*  I've never done anything like that before. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2231.8s)]
*  Randy Weaver appeared to find some of what he traveled all this way for. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2235.0s)]
*  One thing that I remember very vividly was flying back with the guys that we lost. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2239.54s)]
*  Like being on that medevac, even though I wasn't there in the real world, I was there [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2254.7s)]
*  spiritually with them. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2259.38s)]
*  TJ Duff, however, found it unsettling and at times scary. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2262.86s)]
*  I've heard a lot of your guys' stories and I did not get as immersive as you guys did. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2266.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm kind of glad I didn't, honestly, because I was kind of afraid of that. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2270.26s)]
*  That night, Duff took part in another psilocybin ceremony, but the next day he left. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2274.3s)]
*  He later told us the whole experience caused a dangerous decline in his mental health. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2279.86s)]
*  He's now back on antidepressant medication. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2284.54s)]
*  The last ceremony of the retreat was with five MEO DMT, a powerful and fast-acting psychedelic [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2287.84s)]
*  secreted from a toad. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2294.68s)]

*  counselor. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2301.8399999999997s)]
*  I think my biggest takeaway was making sure I make the time to take care of myself. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2302.8399999999997s)]
*  The Veterans Administration warns against self-medicating with psychedelics or using [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2310.44s)]
*  them as part of a self-treatment program. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2315.4199999999996s)]
*  But in December, when we spoke to its top doctor, Sharif Elmahal, he was enthusiastic [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2318.56s)]
*  about their potential. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2323.48s)]
*  Do these retreats concern you? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2325.28s)]
*  They can concern me because there's no way to monitor, certify, make sure that they're [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2327.32s)]
*  actually safe environments. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2332.76s)]
*  They're seeking these therapies because they do not see our current options for them to [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2334.28s)]
*  be effective enough and they're in a state of desperation. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2338.64s)]
*  And that in and of itself, them seeking this type of unauthorized therapy, is just another [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2341.76s)]
*  indication on why we need to study this further and get it to a safe and effective medical [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2347.48s)]
*  environment. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2351.88s)]
*  In August, the FDA rejected a pharmaceutical company's application to use the psychedelic [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2353.12s)]
*  MDMA in combination with therapy as a treatment for PTSD. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2358.56s)]
*  After an FDA advisory panel said there wasn't enough evidence it was safe or effective. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2363.3599999999997s)]

*  and addiction. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2375.92s)]
*  Dr. Elmahal told us a small phase two trial by the VA using MDMA and therapy to treat [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2377.32s)]
*  PTSD completed last year showed real promise. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2383.64s)]
*  45% have gone into complete remission, which is essentially a normal emotional state that [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2388.16s)]
*  is unheard of with prolonged exposure, cognitive processing and certainly SSRIs, the current [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2393.8s)]
*  standard of care options. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2399.64s)]
*  Half of the people who came in with PTSD and did MDMA therapy at the VA were cured? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2401.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2408.4799999999996s)]
*  So you have no doubt that this works? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2409.4799999999996s)]
*  We need to do larger phase three clinical trials. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2411.3599999999997s)]
*  That's the best way scientifically to understand what the true adverse events are and whether [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2414.56s)]
*  we can reproduce these results in larger populations of veterans. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2420.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm very optimistic we will be able to demonstrate that. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2424.68s)]
*  How long do you think it will be before veterans can go to the VA and get this therapy? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2427.68s)]
*  It could be another couple of years. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2433.3199999999997s)]

*  How are you doing? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2474.2s)]
*  Very well. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2476.2s)]
*  Shortly after coming home from the retreat, he decided to retire as a firefighter. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2477.2s)]
*  Prior to the retreat, I thought about taking my life just about every day. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2481.6s)]
*  I had a very close call. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2485.2s)]
*  I had a note, the gun. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2487.56s)]
*  That is no longer the case. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2489.24s)]

*  Not one. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2494.24s)]

*  I don't have any of those thoughts since going through this journey. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2500.16s)]
*  That's remarkable. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2506.88s)]
*  I would say yeah. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2509.32s)]
*  You had told the group afterward that you had visualized people on a medevac helicopter [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2510.92s)]
*  that you had served with. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2520.12s)]

*  To be able to revisit those incidences, seeing those helicopters come back with friends, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v03Ll0p-o&t=2536.52s)]
