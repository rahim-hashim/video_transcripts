# Unexplained drones, UFOs and the state of the Navy | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc)
*  Last month, the head of NORAD and NORTHCOM, the military commands that defend North America, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=0.0s)]
*  told Congress some of those mysterious drones seen flying inside the United States may indeed [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=19.0s)]
*  have been spying. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  He did not say for whom. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=27.04s)]
*  60 Minutes has been looking into a series of eerily similar incidents going back years, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=29.04s)]
*  including those attention-getting flyovers in New Jersey recently. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=34.48s)]
*  In each, drones first appeared over restricted military or civilian sites, coming and going, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  often literally under the radar. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  The wake-up call came just over a year ago, when drones invaded the skies above Langley [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=48.32s)]
*  Air Force Base in Virginia over 17 nights, forcing the relocation of our most advanced [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  fighter jets. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=60.24s)]
*  Our story starts with an eyewitness and an iPhone. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=61.6s)]
*  Close around 7 o'clock, I would say, I started seeing these reddish-orange flashing lights [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=66.48s)]
*  that were starting to come in from the Virginia Beach area. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  It began slowly, like one at a time. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=77.12s)]
*  Jonathan Butner's close encounter with drones came on December 14, 2023. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=79.92s)]
*  He was at his family's cabin on the James River in Virginia, about 100 miles south of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=86.16s)]
*  Washington, D.C., with a commanding view of several military installations across the water. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=91.68s)]
*  They started really coming in, like almost like on a conveyor belt. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=98.08s)]
*  How many in total? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=102.08s)]
*  I probably saw upwards of 40-plus. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=103.28s)]
*  When I first saw that, I was like, dude, those are going directly over Langley Air Force [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=106.4s)]
*  Base. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  Langley is one of the most critical air bases on the East Coast, home to dozens of F-22 [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=112.64s)]
*  Raptors, the most advanced stealth fighter jets ever built. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=121.12s)]
*  Butner says from his perch, he has seen it all. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  I'm very familiar with all the different types of military craft. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=129.52s)]
*  We have Black Hawks. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  We have the F-22s. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=133.52s)]
*  And these were like nothing I've ever seen. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=135.52s)]
*  Butner took these iPhone videos of the objects coming and going for nearly an hour and a half. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  These are the only public videos of the drones over Langley. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=144.8s)]
*  Here's another one. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=148.8s)]
*  They're so similar to each other. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=149.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=150.24s)]
*  He shared this video with the FBI for its investigation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=150.88s)]
*  And another. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=154.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  The reports were coming in 20 to 30 sightings, same time every evening, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  30 to 45 minutes after sunset. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=161.12s)]
*  Retired four-star general Mark Kelly was the highest ranking officer at Langley to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=163.52s)]
*  witness the swarm. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=168.72s)]
*  A veteran fighter pilot, Kelly went up to the roof of a squadron headquarters for an [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=170.0s)]
*  unobstructed view of the airborne invaders. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  So what did you see? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, what you saw was different sizes of incursions of aircraft. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=179.84s)]
*  You saw different altitudes, different airspeed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=184.08s)]
*  Some were rather loud. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=186.88s)]
*  Some weren't near as loud. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  What was the smallest one? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  What was the largest one? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  The smallest, you know, you're talking about a commercial-size quadcopter. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  And then the largest ones are probably the size of what I would call a bass boat or a small car. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=198.16s)]
*  The size of a small car. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=204.0s)]
*  At the time, General Glenn Van Hurk was joint commander of NORAD and NORTHCOM, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=206.4s)]
*  the military commands that protect North American airspace. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  He has since retired. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=215.52s)]
*  I actually provided support in the form of fighters, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  airborne warning and control platforms. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=220.72s)]
*  Helicopters to try to further categorize what those drones were at the time. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  Ten months earlier, he ordered an F-22 from Langley to shoot down that Chinese spy balloon [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  over the Atlantic after it had sailed across the U.S. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=235.84s)]
*  But this time, he found himself ill-equipped to respond. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=239.84s)]
*  NORAD's radar systems, designed during the Cold War to detect high-altitude air, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=244.24s)]
*  space or missile attacks, were unable to detect low-flying drones [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=250.0s)]
*  that could be seen with the naked eye. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=255.04s)]
*  Why don't we just shoot them down? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=257.28s)]
*  Well, first you have to have the capability to detect, track, identify, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=259.84s)]
*  make sure it's not a civilian airplane flying around. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  If you can do that, Bill, then it becomes a safety issue for the American public. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=268.47999999999996s)]
*  Firing missiles in our homeland is not taken lightly. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  We're not able to track them? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=278.4s)]
*  We're not able to see where they originate? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=281.76s)]
*  No, it's a capability gap. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=284.96s)]
*  Certainly, they can come and go from any direction. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  The FBI is looking at potential options, but they don't have an answer right now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=289.52s)]
*  And there haven't been answers for similar encroachments for more than five years. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=294.48s)]
*  There are multiple UASs in the vicinity of Alhamlinson, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=299.52s)]
*  CPA 100 feet in altitude off the bow. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=301.92s)]
*  In 2019, naval warships training off the California coast [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=304.56s)]
*  were shadowed for weeks by dozens of drones. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=309.44s)]
*  We have visual for probable unidentified drones, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  with course unknown and feet unknown. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  For years, the Pentagon did little to dispel speculation. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=320.16s)]
*  These images, taken with night vision equipment, were UFOs. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=324.0s)]
*  But ships' logs show they were identified as drones at the time. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=328.64s)]
*  And the Navy suspected they came from this Hong Kong-flagged freighter sailing nearby, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=333.68s)]
*  but couldn't prove it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  Since then, the defense news site, the War Zone, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=340.96s)]
*  has documented dozens of drone intrusions at sensitive infrastructure and military installations. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=344.4s)]
*  In 2019, the Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona, the largest power producer in the country. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  In 2024, an experimental weapons site in Southern California, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=358.0s)]
*  where defense contractors are building the next generation of stealth bombers. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=362.72s)]
*  Last December, the Army confirmed 11 drone sightings over the Picatinny Arsenal in [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=367.44000000000005s)]
*  northern New Jersey, where advanced weapons are designed and built. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  What is that? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=377.12s)]
*  Which ignited a public frenzy with sightings of unidentified flying objects all over the region. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=378.56s)]
*  New Jersey remains the epicenter of the drone mystery. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  While much of the country was fixated on New Jersey, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=389.44000000000005s)]
*  another swarm of drones was disrupting operations at an air base in the UK, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=392.56s)]
*  where U.S. nuclear weapons have been stored. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=397.6s)]
*  Clearly, there is a military intelligence aspect of this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=400.8s)]
*  Republican Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi is chairman of the Armed Services Committee [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=406.16s)]
*  that oversees the Pentagon. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=411.6s)]
*  We talked to him this past December. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=413.68s)]
*  Do you believe that these drones are a spying system, a spying platform? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=416.32s)]
*  What would a logical person conclude? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=422.88s)]
*  That. That these are spying incursions. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  And yet, I can tell you, I am privy to classified briefings at the highest level. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=430.8s)]
*  I think the Pentagon and the national security advisors are still mystified. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=440.64s)]
*  Still mystified. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=447.68s)]
*  More alarming? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=449.04s)]
*  With drones overhead, some of the F-22s stationed at Langley were moved to a nearby air base for [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=450.24s)]
*  their own protection. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=457.2s)]
*  There's a new wartime reality. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=458.96s)]
*  Drones that can spy can also destroy. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=461.44s)]
*  Deep inside Russia, advanced aircraft have been destroyed by Ukrainian drones. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=464.96s)]
*  General Van Hurk told us drones could do the same thing here. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=470.88s)]
*  I have seen video of drones in various sizes flying over the F-22 flight line at Langley. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=475.2s)]
*  What's your reaction to that? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=482.96s)]
*  They could drop ordnance on them, drop bombs on them. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=484.32s)]
*  They could crash into them to disable them. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=488.64s)]
*  Was that a concern? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=491.2s)]
*  Absolutely, it's a concern. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=492.88s)]
*  Small UAS or drones can do a myriad of missions. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  President Biden was informed of the Langley intrusions, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=499.28s)]
*  and meetings were held at the White House to figure out how to bring the drones down. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=502.8s)]
*  But after 17 nights, the drone visitation stopped. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=507.92s)]
*  A senior official in the Biden White House later downplayed the incident to 60 Minutes, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=512.1600000000001s)]
*  saying it was likely the work of hobbyists. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=517.6s)]
*  From what you saw, did you rule out that these might be hobbyists sending these drones up? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=521.0400000000001s)]
*  No, it would be my assessment they weren't hobbyists because of the magnitude of the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=529.68s)]
*  events, the sizes of some of the drones and the duration. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=534.56s)]
*  So what's going on? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=538.64s)]
*  Well, I wish I had the answer. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=540.56s)]
*  It certainly could have a foreign nexus, a threat nexus. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=542.16s)]
*  They could be doing anything from surveilling critical infrastructure, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=546.64s)]
*  just to the point of embarrassing us from the fact that they can do this on a day-to-day basis, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=550.88s)]
*  and they were not able to do anything about it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  In overseas war zones, the U.S. military has broad authority to bring down menacing drones [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=560.0s)]
*  with gunfire, missiles and electronic jamming. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=566.4799999999999s)]
*  Here at home, any of those actions would pose a threat to civilians on the ground and in the air. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, we certainly need new systems to counter this threat. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=577.1999999999999s)]
*  A year ago, General Gregory Geo, a combat veteran, took control of NORAD and NORTHCOM. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=582.4s)]
*  He ordered a 90-day assessment of operations and says the drones or UAVs at Langley became the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=589.04s)]
*  centerpiece. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=596.16s)]
*  We're the most powerful military on the face of the earth, and yet drones could [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=597.28s)]
*  fly over a major Air Force base, and we couldn't stop them? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=603.76s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=610.88s)]
*  Well, I think the threat got ahead of our ability to detect and track the threat. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=612.72s)]
*  I think all eyes were rightfully overseas, where UAVs were being used on one-way attack [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=619.84s)]
*  to attack U.S. and coalition service members. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=626.0s)]
*  The threat into the U.S. probably caught us by surprise a little bit. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=630.8000000000001s)]
*  As it stands today, could you detect a swarm of drones flying over or flying into the airspace [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=636.08s)]
*  at Langley? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  Could you detect that today? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  At low altitude, probably not with your standard FAA or surveillance radars. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=650.32s)]
*  Complicating his efforts? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=661.6s)]
*  Bureaucracy. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=663.2s)]
*  When the drones flew outside the perimeter of Langley Air Force base, other agencies [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=664.72s)]
*  had jurisdiction. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=670.08s)]
*  The Coast Guard, FAA, FBI, and local police. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=671.44s)]
*  There was no one agency in charge. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=675.9200000000001s)]
*  So what did you determine went on at Langley? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=678.88s)]
*  Well, that investigation is still ongoing, so I don't think we know entirely what happened. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=682.48s)]
*  When we hear things from the White House that it's not deemed a threat, it seems to me that [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=690.96s)]
*  this is alarming. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=697.28s)]
*  This is kind of hair on fire time. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=699.6800000000001s)]
*  It is alarming, and I would say that our hair is on fire here in NorthCom in a controlled [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=702.32s)]
*  way, and we're moving out extremely quickly. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=709.12s)]
*  This past November, General Guillaume was given the authority to cut through the red tape [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=711.84s)]
*  and coordinate counter drone efforts across multiple government agencies. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=717.44s)]
*  He says new, more sensitive radar systems are being installed at strategic bases, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  and NorthCom is developing what it calls flyaway kits with the latest anti-drone technology [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=728.48s)]
*  to be delivered to bases besieged by drones. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=734.96s)]
*  My goal is, inside of a year, that we would have the flyaway capability to augment [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=738.48s)]
*  the services and the installations if they're necessary. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  So within a year, were Langley to happen again, there'd be some ability to respond? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=747.44s)]
*  That's my goal. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=756.0s)]
*  His predecessor, Glenn Van Hurk, says the Pentagon, White House, and Congress have [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=757.04s)]
*  underestimated this massive vulnerability for far too long. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=762.56s)]
*  It's been one year since Langley had their drone incursion, and we don't have the policies [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=767.36s)]
*  and laws in place to deal with this. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=774.56s)]
*  That's not a sense of urgency. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=776.4s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=778.64s)]
*  I think it's because there's a perception that this is Fortress America, two oceans [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=780.0799999999999s)]
*  on the east and west with friendly nations north and south, and nobody's going to attack [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=786.7199999999999s)]
*  our homeland. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=791.92s)]
*  It's time we move beyond that assumption. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  Earlier this summer, the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=804.16s)]
*  released a highly anticipated unclassified report about something the Pentagon calls [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=808.8s)]
*  Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, or UAP, more commonly known as UFOs. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=814.08s)]
*  The government's grudging acknowledgement of 144 mysterious sightings documented by [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=820.8s)]
*  our military comes after decades of public denial. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=826.56s)]
*  But as we first reported in May, whatever is trespassing in our skies and seas poses [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=830.8s)]
*  a serious safety risk to our servicemen and women as well as our national security. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=837.1199999999999s)]
*  So what you're telling me is that UFOs, unidentified flying objects, are real? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=845.1199999999999s)]
*  Bill, I think we're beyond that already. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=855.28s)]
*  The government has already stated for the record that they're real. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=857.04s)]
*  I'm not telling you that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=859.4399999999999s)]
*  The United States government is telling you that. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  Luis Elizondo spent 20 years running military intelligence operations worldwide in Afghanistan, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=863.0400000000001s)]
*  the Middle East, and Guantanamo. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=869.6800000000001s)]
*  He hadn't given UFOs a second thought until 2008. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=872.1600000000001s)]
*  That's when he was asked to join something at the Pentagon called the Advanced Aerospace [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=876.32s)]
*  Threat Identification Program, or ATIP. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=881.2800000000001s)]
*  The mission of ATIP was quite simple. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=884.8000000000001s)]
*  It was to collect and analyze information involving anomalous aerial vehicles. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=886.56s)]
*  What I guess in the vernacular you call them UFOs. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=892.0799999999999s)]
*  We call them UAPs. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=894.9599999999999s)]
*  You know how this sounds. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=896.64s)]
*  It sounds nutty, wacky. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=898.16s)]
*  Look, Bill, I'm not telling you that it doesn't sound wacky. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=900.7199999999999s)]
*  What I'm telling you is real. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=904.8s)]
*  The question is, what is it? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=906.3199999999999s)]
*  What are its intentions? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=907.92s)]
*  What are its capabilities? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=909.1199999999999s)]
*  Buried away in the Pentagon, ATIP was part of a $22 million program [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=911.04s)]
*  sponsored by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to investigate UFOs. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=916.48s)]
*  When Elizondo took over in 2010, he focused on the national security implications of [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=922.32s)]
*  unidentified aerial phenomena documented by U.S. service members. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=928.24s)]
*  Imagine a technology that can do 600 to 700 G-forces, that can fly at 13,000 miles an hour, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=933.28s)]
*  that can evade radar, and that can fly through air and water and possibly space, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=940.3199999999999s)]
*  and oh, by the way, has no obvious signs of propulsion, no wings, no control surfaces, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=947.6s)]
*  and yet still can defy the natural effects of Earth's gravity. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=952.64s)]
*  That's precisely what we're seeing. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=955.92s)]
*  Elizondo tells us ATIP was a loose-knit mix of scientists, electro-optical engineers, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=957.6s)]
*  avionics, and intelligence experts often working part-time. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=964.08s)]
*  They combed through data and records and analyzed videos like this. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=968.4s)]
*  A Navy aircrew struggles to lock onto a fast-moving object off the U.S. Atlantic coast in 2015. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=978.3199999999999s)]
*  Recently released images may not convince UFO skeptics, but the Pentagon admits it [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=988.0799999999999s)]
*  doesn't know what in the world this is, or this, or this. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=993.68s)]
*  Look at that thing! [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=999.4399999999999s)]
*  So what do you say to the skeptics? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1001.12s)]
*  It's refracted light, weather balloons, a rocket being launched, Venus. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1003.04s)]
*  In some cases, there are simple explanations for what people are witnessing, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1011.12s)]
*  but there are some that are not. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1015.76s)]
*  We're not just simply jumping to a conclusion that's saying, oh, that's a UAP out there. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1019.28s)]
*  We're going through our due diligence. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1023.52s)]
*  Is it some sort of new type of cruise missile technology that China has developed? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1024.96s)]
*  Is it some sort of high-altitude balloon that's conducting reconnaissance? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1028.8799999999999s)]
*  Ultimately, when you have exhausted all those what-ifs and you're still left with [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1033.36s)]
*  the fact that this is in our airspace and it's real, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1038.96s)]
*  that's when it becomes compelling and that's when it becomes problematic. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1042.24s)]
*  Former Navy pilot Lieutenant Ryan Graves calls whatever is out there a security risk. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1046.96s)]
*  He told us his F-18 squadron began seeing UAPs hovering over restricted airspace [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1053.6s)]
*  southeast of Virginia Beach in 2014 when they updated their jet's radar, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1060.16s)]
*  making it possible to zero in with infrared targeting cameras. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1065.44s)]
*  So you're seeing it both with the radar and with the infrared, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1070.4s)]
*  and that tells you that there is something out there. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1073.76s)]
*  It's pretty hard to spoof that. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1077.36s)]
*  These photographs were taken in 2019 in the same area. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1079.44s)]
*  The Pentagon confirms these are images of objects it can't identify. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1083.68s)]
*  Lieutenant Graves told us pilots training off the Atlantic coast [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1088.8799999999999s)]
*  see things like that all the time. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1092.8s)]
*  Every day. Every day for at least a couple years. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1095.9199999999998s)]
*  Wait a minute, every day for a couple of years? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1100.08s)]
*  I don't see an exhaust. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1103.2s)]
*  Including this one off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida in 2015 [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1105.0400000000002s)]
*  captured on a targeting camera by members of Graves squadron. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1109.92s)]
*  It's rotating. My gosh. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1115.76s)]
*  They're all going against the wind. The wind's 120 knots to the west. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1120.8000000000002s)]
*  You can sort of hear a surprise in their voices. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1126.0800000000002s)]
*  You certainly can. They seem to have broke character a bit [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1128.0800000000002s)]
*  and we're just kind of amazed at what they were seeing. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1131.1200000000001s)]
*  What do you think when you see something like this? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1133.92s)]
*  This is a difficult one to explain. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1136.5600000000002s)]
*  You have rotation. You have high altitudes. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1138.5600000000002s)]
*  You have propulsion, right? I don't know. I don't know what it is, frankly. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1141.2s)]
*  He told us pilots speculate they are one of three things. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1145.6000000000001s)]
*  Secret U.S. technology, an adversary spy vehicle, or something otherworldly. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1149.8400000000001s)]
*  I'd say, you know, the highest probability is it's a threat observation program. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1156.8000000000002s)]
*  Could it be Russian or Chinese technology? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1161.2s)]
*  I don't see why not. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1164.72s)]
*  Are you alarmed? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1166.16s)]
*  I am worried, frankly. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1167.44s)]
*  You know, if these were tactical jets from another country that were hanging out up there, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1169.52s)]
*  it would be a massive issue. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1172.64s)]
*  But because it looks slightly different, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1174.32s)]
*  we're not willing to actually look at the problem in the face. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1176.0s)]
*  We're happy to just ignore the fact that these are out there watching us every day. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1179.6000000000001s)]
*  The government has ignored it, at least publicly, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1184.0800000000002s)]
*  since closing its Project Blue Book investigation in 1969. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1186.8s)]
*  But that began to change after an incident off Southern California in 2004, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1190.96s)]
*  which was documented by radar, by camera, and four naval aviators. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1196.16s)]
*  We spoke to two of them, David Fravor, a graduate of the Top Gun Naval Flight School, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1201.52s)]
*  and commander of the F-18 Squadron on the USS Nimitz, and flying at his wing, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1206.96s)]
*  Lieutenant Alex Dietrich, who has never spoken publicly about the encounter. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1212.72s)]
*  I never wanted to be on national TV. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1218.0s)]
*  No offense. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1220.64s)]
*  So why are you doing this? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1221.8400000000001s)]
*  Because I was in a government aircraft, because I was on the clock. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1223.44s)]
*  And so I feel a responsibility to share what I can, and it is unclassified. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1227.68s)]
*  It was November 2004, and the USS Nimitz carrier strike group [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1235.04s)]
*  was training about 100 miles southwest of San Diego. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1239.92s)]
*  For a week, the advanced new radar on a nearby ship, the USS Princeton, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1243.92s)]
*  had detected what operators called multiple anomalous aerial vehicles over the horizon, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1249.04s)]
*  descending 80,000 feet in less than a second. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1254.8799999999999s)]
*  On November 14, Fravor and Dietrich, each with a weapon system officer in the backseat, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1260.0s)]
*  were diverted to investigate. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1265.68s)]
*  They found an area of roiling white water the size of a 737 in an otherwise calm blue sea. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1268.48s)]
*  So as we're looking at this, her backseater says, hey, skipper, do you? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1276.64s)]
*  And about that got out, I said, dude, do you see that thing down there? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1283.12s)]
*  And we saw this little white tic-tac looking object, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1286.96s)]
*  and it's just kind of moving above the white water area. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1290.4s)]
*  As Dietrich circled above, Fravor went in for a closer look. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1292.96s)]
*  The tic-tac still pointing north-south, it goes, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1299.28s)]
*  it goes, and just turns abruptly and starts mirroring me. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1301.52s)]
*  So as I'm coming down, it starts coming up. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1305.2s)]
*  So it's mimicking your moves. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1307.68s)]
*  Yeah, it was where we were there. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1309.6s)]
*  He said it was about the size of his F-18, with no markings, no wings, no exhaust plumes. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1311.28s)]
*  I'll see how close I can get. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1317.92s)]
*  So I go like this, and it's climbing still. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1319.76s)]
*  When it gets right in front of me, it just disappears. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1322.6399999999999s)]
*  Disappears? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1325.52s)]
*  Disappears. Like gone. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1326.16s)]
*  It had sped off. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1328.48s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1330.32s)]
*  So your mind tries to make sense of it. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1331.68s)]
*  I'm going to categorize this as maybe a helicopter or maybe a drone. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1333.76s)]
*  And when it disappeared, I mean, it was just... [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1338.96s)]
*  Did your backseaters see this too? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1341.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1344.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1344.24s)]
*  There was four of us in the airplanes, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1344.8799999999999s)]
*  literally watching this thing for roughly about five minutes. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1346.8799999999999s)]
*  Seconds later, the Princeton reacquired the target, 60 miles away. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1349.68s)]
*  Another crew managed to briefly lock onto it with a targeting camera before it zipped off again. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1355.04s)]
*  I think that over beers, we've sort of said, hey, man, if I saw this solo, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1361.76s)]
*  I don't know that I would have come back and said anything, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1367.04s)]
*  because it sounds so crazy when I say it. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1369.04s)]
*  You understand that reaction? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1371.84s)]
*  I do. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1373.76s)]
*  You've had some people tell me, you know, when you say that, you can sound crazy. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1374.72s)]
*  And I'll be, I'm not a UFO guy. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1377.6s)]
*  But from what I hear you guys saying, there's something. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1380.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1385.92s)]
*  Oh, there's definitely something that... [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1386.16s)]
*  I don't know who's building it, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1388.48s)]
*  who's got the technology, who's got the brains, but there's something out there that [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1390.0800000000002s)]
*  was better than our airplane. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1394.8s)]
*  The air crew filed reports. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1397.28s)]
*  Then, like the mysterious flying object, the Nimitz encounter disappeared. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1399.52s)]
*  Nothing was said or done officially for five years, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1404.96s)]
*  until Lou Elizondo came across the story and investigated. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1409.04s)]
*  We spend millions of dollars in training these pilots, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1413.8400000000001s)]
*  and they are seeing something that they can't explain. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1417.12s)]
*  Furthermore, that information is being backed up on electro-optical data, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1419.9199999999998s)]
*  like gun camera footage, and by radar data. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1423.6s)]
*  Now, to me, that's compelling. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1426.08s)]
*  Inside the Pentagon, his findings were met with skepticism. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1428.4799999999998s)]
*  ACHIP's funding was eliminated in 2012, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1432.3999999999999s)]
*  but Elizondo says he and a handful of others kept the mission alive, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1435.4399999999998s)]
*  until finally, frustrated, he quit the Pentagon in 2017. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1440.1599999999999s)]
*  But not before getting these three videos declassified. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1445.04s)]
*  And then things took a stranger turn. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1449.52s)]
*  I tried to help my colleague Lou Elizondo elevate the issue in the department [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1452.6399999999999s)]
*  and actually get it to the Secretary of Defense. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1456.24s)]
*  Christopher Mellon served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1458.24s)]
*  for Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush, and had access to top-secret government programs. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1462.8s)]
*  So it's not us. That's one thing we know. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1469.2s)]
*  We know that. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1471.52s)]
*  I could say that with a very high degree of confidence, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1472.4s)]
*  in part because of the positions I held in the department, and I know the process. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1474.8000000000002s)]
*  Mellon says he grew concerned nothing was being done about UAPs, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1479.44s)]
*  so he decided to do something. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1484.0s)]
*  In 2017, as a private citizen, he surreptitiously acquired the three Navy videos [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1486.88s)]
*  Elizondo had declassified and leaked them to the New York Times. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1492.72s)]
*  It's bizarre and unfortunate that someone like myself has to do something like that [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1497.68s)]
*  to get a national security issue like this on the agenda. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1503.76s)]
*  He joined forces with now civilian Lou Elizondo, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1506.8s)]
*  and they started to tell their story to anybody who would listen, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1510.48s)]
*  to newspapers, the History Channel, to members of Congress. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1514.0800000000002s)]
*  We knew and understood that you had to go to the public, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1518.24s)]
*  get the public interested, to get Congress interested, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1520.72s)]
*  to then circle back to the Defense Department and get them to start taking a look at it. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1523.1200000000001s)]
*  And now it is. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1528.48s)]
*  Last year, the Pentagon resurrected AATIP. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1530.48s)]
*  It's now called the UAP Task Force. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1533.3600000000001s)]
*  Service members now are encouraged to report strange encounters, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1536.4s)]
*  and the Senate wants answers. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1540.72s)]
*  Anything that enters an airspace that's not supposed to be there is a threat. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1543.3600000000001s)]
*  After receiving classified briefings on UAPs, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1547.1200000000001s)]
*  Senator Marco Rubio called for a detailed analysis. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1550.48s)]

*  he asked the Director of National Intelligence and the Pentagon [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1558.8s)]
*  to present Congress an unclassified report by next month. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1562.3999999999999s)]
*  This is a bizarre issue. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1567.04s)]
*  The Pentagon and other branches of the military have a long history of sort of dismissing this. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1568.6399999999999s)]
*  What makes you think that this time is going to be different? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1575.12s)]
*  I mean, we're going to find out when we get that report. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1577.28s)]
*  You know, there's a stigma on Capitol Hill. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1579.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, some of my colleagues are very interested in this topic, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1581.52s)]
*  some kind of, you know, giggle when you bring it up. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1584.64s)]
*  But I don't think we can allow the stigma to keep us from having an answer to a very fundamental question. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1587.6s)]
*  What do you want us to do about this? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1592.8s)]
*  I want us to take it seriously and have a process to take it seriously. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1594.8s)]
*  I want us to have a process to analyze the data every time it comes in, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1597.92s)]
*  that there be a place where this is cataloged and constantly analyzed until we get some answers. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1601.52s)]
*  Maybe it has a very simple answer. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1606.64s)]
*  Maybe it doesn't. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1610.32s)]
*  A few weeks after our story aired, the Director of National Intelligence released an unclassified [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1611.04s)]
*  report saying UAP probably lack a single explanation, but that some, quote, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1616.3999999999999s)]

*  It's an aircraft carrier and its air wing is capable of 150 strike or air-to-air sorties per [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=1920.0s)]

*  Yes, they can. If they've got the targeting in place, they could hit this aircraft carrier. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2257.68s)]
*  If I don't want to be hit, there's something I can do about it. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2264.64s)]
*  U.S. Navy planners aren't just plotting how to evade China's rocket force, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2268.3999999999996s)]
*  but also how they could effectively fight back. From the vicinity of Guam, none of the aircraft [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2272.7999999999997s)]
*  on this ship has the range to approach Taiwan without refueling in the air. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2279.9199999999996s)]
*  Ships like the U.S. destroyer Wayne E. Meyer, part of the Nimitz Strike Group, would need to sail much [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2285.2s)]
*  closer towards China to fire their missiles at any force invading Taiwan. One naval scholar we spoke [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2292.7999999999997s)]
*  to likened it to a boxing match in which a fighter, in this case China, has much longer arms than their [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2300.96s)]
*  potential opponent, the U.S. I'll give you a lot of examples where a shorter fighter was able to prevail [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2309.36s)]
*  over a long-armed fighter by being on their toes, by maneuvering, and we can also stick and move [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2316.32s)]
*  while we're developing those longer-range weapons. There is another area of modern naval warfare [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2325.84s)]
*  where the U.S. had a head start and retains a deep advantage over China. I just noticed out of the [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2332.08s)]
*  corner of my eye. This is a 688 class, a Los Angeles class attack submarine. This is the most [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2338.48s)]
*  capable submarine on the planet, you know, with the exception of the Virginia class, our newer [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2343.92s)]
*  class of submarines. The exact number is classified, but our best estimate is that there are about a [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2349.6s)]
*  dozen nuclear-powered fast attack submarines patrolling the Pacific at any time. They are [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2355.6s)]
*  difficult to detect and track, something China is trying to solve. How much more advanced is [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2361.7599999999998s)]
*  U.S. submarine technology than Chinese capability? A generation. A generation. And by a generation, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2368.3199999999997s)]
*  I think 10 or 20 years, but broadly I don't really talk in depth about submarine capabilities. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2376.7999999999997s)]
*  It's the silent service. Since Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, China's military leaders have [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2382.3199999999997s)]
*  themselves been mostly silent and ignored efforts by the U.S. military to keep the lines of [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2388.56s)]
*  communication open, even when a Chinese spy balloon breached American airspace and was [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2394.48s)]
*  shot down by the U.S. If the U.S. and Chinese militaries can't communicate over a Chinese spy [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2400.24s)]
*  balloon, then what's going to happen when there's a real crisis in the South China Sea or with Taiwan? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2407.92s)]
*  We'll hope that they'll answer the phone. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2413.92s)]
*  Else, we'll do our very best assessment based on the things that they say in open source [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2418.48s)]
*  and based on their behavior to divine their intentions and we'll act accordingly. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2424.56s)]
*  Doesn't that make the situation even more dangerous if the U.S. and Chinese militaries [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2430.56s)]
*  are not talking? Yes. Several sources within the Pentagon tell 60 Minutes that if China [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2436.8s)]
*  invaded Taiwan, it could very well kick off in outer space, with both sides targeting the other [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2443.84s)]
*  satellites that enable precision-guided weaponry. Cyber attacks on American cities and the sabotage [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2450.1600000000003s)]
*  of ports on the west coast of the U.S. mainland could follow. One recent non-classified war game [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2457.1200000000003s)]
*  had the U.S. prevailing but losing 20 ships, including two carriers. Does that sound about [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2464.1600000000003s)]
*  right? That is a plausible outcome. I can imagine a more pessimistic outcome and I can imagine a [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2469.92s)]
*  more optimistic outcome. We should be clear-eyed about the costs that we're potentially incurring. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2477.6s)]
*  There are about 5,000 Americans on board the Nimitz. The ship is nearly half a century old. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2485.44s)]
*  Given the Navy's current needs in the Pacific and because there's fuel left in its nuclear reactors, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2492.64s)]
*  the carrier's life at sea is going to be extended. Is it your hope that the power of the U.S. Navy, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2499.2s)]
*  the forced posture of the U.S. Navy, will deter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan? It's not my hope, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2506.7999999999997s)]
*  it's my duty in conjunction with allies and partners to deliver intolerable costs to anybody [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2513.52s)]
*  that would upend the order in violation of the nation's security or in violation of the nation's [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2520.56s)]
*  interests. The saying which is, see Pacham Parabellum, which is, if you want peace, prepare for war. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2526.16s)]
*  Since our story first aired in March, China has intensified its aggressive military tactics in the [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2534.56s)]
*  Western Pacific. In June, a Chinese warship nearly collided with a U.S. destroyer in the Taiwan [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2540.3999999999996s)]
*  Strait. When we return, critical questions about the state of the U.S. Navy and its readiness. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2547.2s)]
*  60 minutes spent months talking to Kern and former naval officers, military strategists, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2556.16s)]
*  and politicians about the state of the U.S. Navy. One common thread in our reporting is unease, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2568.7999999999997s)]
*  both about the size of the U.S. fleet and its readiness to fight. The Navy ships are being [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2575.68s)]
*  retired faster than they're getting replaced, while the Navy of the People's Republic of China, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2581.52s)]
*  or PRC, grows larger and more lethal by the year. We first asked the commander of the U.S. Pacific [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2586.8s)]
*  Fleet, Admiral Samuel Paparo, about this on our visit earlier this year to the USS Nimitz, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2594.24s)]
*  the oldest aircraft carrier in the Navy. We call it the decade of concern. We've seen a tenfold [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2600.08s)]
*  increase in the size of the PRC Navy. Technically speaking, the Chinese now have the largest [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2609.76s)]
*  Navy in the world in terms of number of ships, correct? Yes. Do the numbers matter? Yes. As [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2617.6000000000004s)]
*  the saying goes, quantity has a quality all its own. At some point, are they going to reach numbers [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2623.36s)]
*  that we can't prevail over? I'm not comfortable with the trajectory. If you look at a map at the [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2630.1600000000003s)]
*  Indo-Pacific, one thing becomes clear. There's a lot of water on that map. And so ours has to be [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2635.84s)]
*  a maritime strategy. Republican Mike Gallagher and Democrat Elaine Luria served together on [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2642.1600000000003s)]
*  the House Armed Services Committee in the last Congress. What is it about the U.S. Navy that [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2648.7200000000003s)]
*  has allowed the two of you to find common cause? I think we share a sense of the urgency of the [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2654.1600000000003s)]
*  moment. We see increasing threats from China in particular, in the Indo-Pacific. We feel like we [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2658.88s)]
*  are not moving fast enough to build a bigger Navy. Congressman Gallagher is a Marine veteran [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2664.56s)]
*  who represents Green Bay, Wisconsin. He chairs the new House Committee on China. He's concerned [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2670.08s)]
*  that under the Navy's current plan, the fleet will shrink to about 280 ships by 2027, the same year [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2676.64s)]
*  the CIA says China has set for having the capability to take Taiwan by force. So we will be [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2684.32s)]
*  weakest when our enemy is potentially strongest. China's increased rhetoric and potential aggression [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2690.72s)]
*  against Taiwan, we're going to have to be ready to respond today with the forces we have today. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2696.3199999999997s)]
*  Former Congresswoman Elaine Luria represented Virginia Beach until this past January. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2701.52s)]
*  An Annapolis graduate, Luria had a 20-year naval career before being elected to Congress. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2707.2799999999997s)]
*  What would you say the state of the U.S. Navy is today? I think the Navy has not received the [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2713.4399999999996s)]
*  attention and resources that it needs over two decades. I mean, I served on six different ships. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2718.8s)]
*  Every single one of those ships was either built during or a product of the fleet that was built [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2723.2000000000003s)]
*  in the Cold War. Both Mike Gallagher and Elaine Luria have lobbied for government money for the [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2729.6800000000003s)]
*  shipyards in or near their districts, but they say this is less about jobs and more about national [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2735.2000000000003s)]
*  security. If we don't get this right, all of these other things we're doing in Congress, ultimately [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2741.04s)]
*  that might not matter. If you think about what a coherent grand strategy vis-a-vis China would be, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2745.2s)]
*  hard power would be the most important part of that and the Navy would be the most [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2749.3599999999997s)]
*  important component of your hard power investments. Over the last two decades, the Navy spent $55 [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2752.8799999999997s)]
*  billion on two investments that did not pan out. The first was a class of destroyers known as the [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2760.0s)]
*  Zumwalt. The futuristic fighting ships were supposed to revolutionize naval warfare. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2767.4399999999996s)]
*  32 were ordered, but only three were ever launched. The cost of each ship by one estimate [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2774.08s)]
*  was upwards of $8 billion, making them the three most expensive destroyers ever put to sea. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2780.64s)]
*  Another example is the Littoral Combat Ship or LCS, designed to be a fast, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2789.92s)]
*  all-purpose warship for shallow waters. $30 billion later, the program ran aground. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2795.44s)]
*  After structural defects and engine trouble, within the Navy, the LCS earned the unfortunate [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2803.12s)]
*  nickname, Little Crappy Ship. The Navy's last few decades have been described as a lost generation [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2809.68s)]
*  of shipbuilding. Is that overly dramatic? I don't think so. We're still struggling to build ships [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2816.72s)]
*  on time, on budget, and that's something we absolutely need to fix going forward. This [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2823.3599999999997s)]
*  past March, we spoke with Admiral Mike Gilday at the Pentagon. He is the chief of naval operations [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2827.52s)]
*  and is responsible for building, maintaining, and equipping the entire U.S. Navy. Is the Navy in [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2833.84s)]
*  crisis? No, the Navy's not in crisis. The Navy is out on point every single day. Is it being outpaced [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2840.16s)]
*  by China? No. Our Navy's still in a position to prevail, but that's not blind confidence. We are [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2848.48s)]
*  concerned with the trajectory that China's on, with China's behavior, but we are in a good position [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2855.92s)]
*  right now if we did ever get into a fight against them. How would you describe what China has been [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2861.6800000000003s)]
*  able to do militarily over the last 20 years? The most alarming thing is the growth of not only their [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2867.76s)]
*  conventional forces, but also their strategic nuclear forces, their cyber capability, their [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2873.84s)]
*  space capability, and how they're using that to force other nations, navies, out of certain areas [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2879.28s)]
*  in the South China Sea. Instead of recognizing international law, they want to control where [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2886.6400000000003s)]
*  those goods flow and how. What lessons did the U.S. Navy learn from some of the shipbuilding [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2892.6400000000003s)]
*  mistakes of the last 20 years? I think one of the things that we learned was that we need to [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2898.6400000000003s)]
*  have a design well in place before we begin bending metal. And so we're going back to the [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2904.96s)]
*  past to what we did in the 80s and the 90s. The Navy has the lead. There is a tendency among [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2911.3599999999997s)]
*  the great powers to look at each other's naval buildups with deep suspicion. Toshi Yoshihara, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2918.0s)]
*  of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, may know more than any scholar [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2924.24s)]
*  in the West about China's Navy. China will have about 440 ships by 2030, and that's according to [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2929.68s)]
*  the Pentagon. Why is China able to build more warships more quickly than the U.S.? China has [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2937.6s)]
*  clearly invested in this defense industrial infrastructure to produce these ships, which [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2944.0s)]
*  allows them to produce multiple ships simultaneously, essentially outbuilding many of the Western [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2949.52s)]
*  navies combined. China's Navy piggybacks on a booming commercial shipbuilding industry, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2955.68s)]
*  kept afloat by generous state subsidies, inexpensive materials, and cheap labor. In the United States, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2961.44s)]
*  it's a different story. After the Cold War ended, the shipbuilding industry consolidated, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2969.12s)]
*  and many of the yards where ships were both built and maintained closed down. What do you see when [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2975.2799999999997s)]
*  you see China's shipbuilding program? It's very robust. Do we have enough shipyards? No. I wish [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2981.2s)]
*  that we had more commercial shipyards. Over my career, we've gone from more than 30 shipyards [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2986.7999999999997s)]
*  down to about seven that we rely upon on a day-to-day basis to build ships. One of those yards [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2991.68s)]
*  is run by Huntington Ingalls Industries, which built the state-of-the-art new Ford-class aircraft [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=2997.2799999999997s)]

*  there's a multi-year backlog repairing the ships in the fleet. Our maintenance backlog is one of [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3028.3199999999997s)]
*  the primary things that I'm working on to correct. So just three years ago, we had 7,700 delay days, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3034.72s)]
*  that is extra days in a shipyard by ships when they weren't operational. We have cut that down [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3043.2799999999997s)]
*  to 3,000. We are not satisfied. Maintenance delays mean sailors can't come home because the ship [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3049.68s)]
*  that's supposed to replace them is not ready. It means longer deployments. It means away from [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3056.96s)]

*  we can get those ships to sea as quickly as possible. In the last year alone, at least 10 [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3080.2400000000002s)]
*  sailors assigned to ships undergoing maintenance or working at maintenance facilities have died [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3085.12s)]
*  by suicide. It is a problem that we're taking very, very seriously and down to every leader in our [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3091.44s)]
*  Navy. Everybody has a responsibility to look out for each other, to take care of each other. There [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3098.7999999999997s)]

*  serving alongside hundreds of unmanned vessels by 2045. I think unmanned is the future, and so I think [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3117.28s)]
*  that some 40 percent of our fleet in the future, I believe, is going to be unmanned. Are these like [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3124.7200000000003s)]
*  underwater drones? Some of them are highly capable, capable of delivering mines and perhaps other types [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3130.2400000000002s)]

*  Can you say what it will do or is that classified? Well, at a minimum, it'll have a clandestine mine [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3143.8399999999997s)]
*  laying capability, so it'll be done in a way that is very secretive but very effective. But the GAO [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3149.2799999999997s)]
*  reports that it's already a quarter of a billion dollars over budget and three years behind schedule. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3156.4s)]
*  That particular platform is behind schedule. It's the first of a kind when it delivers, I see a very [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3164.16s)]

*  most lethal and stealthy platforms in the arsenal of the U.S. military. The Navy's total budget request [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3177.52s)]

*  Perhaps the Chinese minister doesn't like the fact that the U.S. Navy is operating in collaboration [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3207.28s)]
*  with dozens of navies around the world to ensure that the maritime commons remains free and open [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3214.48s)]

*  but our presence is not intended to be provocative. It's intended to assure and to reassure allies and [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrM_NQS3_Fc&t=3227.52s)]
