# Julian Assange & WikiLeaks; Reality Winner; Security clearance for America's secrets | Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [March 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540)
*  Just a few months ago, most people had never heard of a website called WikiLeaks or of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=0.0s)]
*  its mysterious and eccentric founder, Julian Assange. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  But in that short period of time, both have managed to rattle the worlds of journalism, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=22.34s)]
*  diplomacy, and national security. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=27.12s)]
*  WikiLeaks, which solicits and publishes secrets and suppressed material from whistleblowers [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=30.52s)]
*  around the world, has been under cyber attack from governments that want to shut it down. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=35.68s)]
*  And Assange is currently under legal attack from the U.S. government, which would like [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=40.68s)]
*  to charge him with espionage for publishing volumes of classified material from the Pentagon [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  and the State Department. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  We spent two days with him in Britain, where he is under house arrest while fighting extradition [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  to Sweden for questioning in two sexual assault cases, which he's called part of a smear campaign [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=57.12s)]
*  against him. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=62.64s)]
*  In his most extensive television interview to date, Assange talked to us about his work, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=63.64s)]
*  his vision, and the prospect of facing criminal charges in the United States. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you've been called a lot of names. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=73.36s)]
*  You've been characterized as a hero and as a villain, a martyr, terrorist. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=76.52s)]
*  Well, not yet a martyr. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=82.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=84.24s)]
*  Let's keep it that way. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=85.24s)]
*  For now, Julian Assange is holed up on this bucolic 600-acre English estate with an ankle [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=86.24s)]
*  bracelet, a 10 o'clock curfew, and a slow internet connection. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=92.6s)]
*  He declined to talk to us about the allegations in Sweden on the advice of his attorney. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=96.96s)]
*  He has not been charged and proclaims his innocence. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=102.16s)]
*  Well, I suppose if you have to be under house arrest, there could be worse places. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=104.8s)]
*  Well, it's a gilded cage. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=108.88s)]
*  It's still a cage. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=111.0s)]
*  But when you're forced to stay somewhere against your will, it does become something that you [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=112.16s)]
*  want to leave. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=119.84s)]
*  It's a radical departure from the lifestyle that the peripatetic internet muckraker is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=121.72s)]
*  used to, bounding from city to city, country to country, and regularly changing his cell [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=126.32s)]
*  phones, hairstyles, and general appearance, he says, to elude surveillance and avoid being [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=131.96s)]
*  killed, kidnapped, or arrested. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=137.28s)]
*  And there are reasons for his paranoia. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=139.92s)]
*  In the last four years, WikiLeaks has published information that played some role in deciding [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=142.11999999999998s)]
*  the 2007 elections in Kenya and fueling the anger that recently brought down the government [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  of Tunisia. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  It's divulged membership roles of a neo-Nazi organization in Britain and secret documents [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  from the Church of Scientology. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=159.44s)]
*  And that was before Assange began publishing U.S. secrets, provoking what he calls threatening [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=161.76s)]
*  statements from people close to power. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=167.04s)]
*  What statements are you referring to? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=169.64s)]
*  The statements by the Vice President, Biden, saying, for instance, that I was a high-tech [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=171.32s)]
*  terrorist. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=179.28s)]
*  Sarah Palin calling to our organization to be dealt with like the Taliban and be hunted [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=180.28s)]
*  down. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=185.16s)]
*  There's calls either for my assassination or the assassination of my staff, or for us [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=186.16s)]
*  to be kidnapped and renditioned back to the United States to be executed. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=191.6s)]
*  Well, as you know, we have a First Amendment and people can say whatever they want, including [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  politicians. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't think that many people in the United States took seriously the idea that you were [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  a terrorist. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=207.32s)]
*  I would like to believe that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  On the other hand, that incitements to murder are a serious issue and unfortunately there [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=210.72s)]
*  is a portion of the population that will believe in them and may carry them out. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=217.56s)]
*  If nothing else, WikiLeaks is the latest demonstration that a small group of people with a powerful [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=223.0s)]
*  idea can harness technology and affect large institutions. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=228.44s)]
*  In WikiLeaks' case, it was the idea to aggregate state and corporate secrets by setting up [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=233.68s)]
*  an online electronic drop box where whistleblowers around the world could anonymously upload [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=239.6s)]
*  sensitive and suppressed information. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=245.88s)]
*  The secrets are stored on servers around the world beyond the reach of governments or law [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=248.38s)]
*  enforcement, then released worldwide on the internet. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=252.84s)]
*  The US does not have the technology to take the site down. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=256.56s)]
*  Because? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=260.0s)]
*  Just the way the way our technology is constructed, the way the internet is constructed, it's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=261.0s)]
*  quite hard to stop things reappearing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=268.04s)]
*  So we've had attacks on particular domain names, little pieces of infrastructure knocked [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=271.16s)]
*  out but we now have some 2,000 fully independent in every way websites where we are publishing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=275.56s)]
*  around the world. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=284.64s)]
*  WikiLeaks first caught the attention of most Americans last April when it released this [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=286.04s)]
*  video. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=291.12s)]
*  It shows a US Apache helicopter crew in Iraq opening fire on a group of suspected insurgents [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=292.36s)]
*  who were standing on a street corner in Baghdad. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=298.76s)]
*  Some of the men were armed, but two of them were journalists from Reuters. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=302.12s)]
*  At least a dozen people were killed in the attack, some of them innocent civilians. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=314.92s)]
*  Then last July, WikiLeaks released 76,000 classified field reports of US operations [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=320.0s)]
*  that provided a chaotic and bleak ground level view of the war. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=327.24s)]
*  In October, there were another 400,000 classified documents released from Iraq showing that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=334.12s)]
*  civilian casualties there were much higher than the Pentagon had claimed. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=340.16s)]
*  And finally in November, thousands of State Department cables that lifted the veil on [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=345.22s)]
*  highly sensitive backroom diplomacy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=350.04s)]
*  The documents revealed that Arab leaders were lobbying the US to attack Iran and that the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=353.06s)]
*  State Department had been secretly collecting intelligence on leaders at the United Nations. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=358.46s)]
*  It triggered outcries that Assange was a political actor trying to damage the US government. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=364.14s)]
*  Are you a subversive? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=370.78s)]
*  I'm sure there are certain views amongst Hillary Clinton and her lot that we are subverting [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=372.06s)]
*  their authority. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=379.14s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=380.14s)]
*  We are subverting illegitimate authority. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=381.62s)]
*  The question is whether the authority is legitimate or whether it is illegitimate. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=386.34000000000003s)]
*  You consider the US State Department a legitimate authority? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=390.14s)]
*  It's legitimate insofar as its actions are legitimate. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=394.14s)]
*  It has actions that are not legitimate. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=397.58s)]
*  And you've gone after the ones that you think are illegitimate? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=399.94s)]
*  We don't go after. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=402.88s)]
*  That's a bit of a misconception. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=404.74s)]
*  We don't go after a particular country. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=407.4s)]
*  We don't go after a particular organization or group. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=409.28s)]
*  We just stick to our promise of publishing material that is likely to have a significant [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=413.08s)]
*  impact. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=421.32s)]
*  To increase the impact of the US documents, Assange decided to share them with some of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=422.32s)]
*  the leading news organizations in the world, including the New York Times, a relationship [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=427.52s)]
*  that grew testy when Assange published the first set of war logs without removing the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  names of Afghans who were cooperating with US forces. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=438.32s)]
*  The most persistent criticism from within the press has been that you have behaved recklessly [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=442.08s)]
*  from time to time. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=449.36s)]
*  And the example that they cite is that you've decided to release Afghan documents without [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=451.48s)]
*  redacting the names of people who had provided intelligence to the US government. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=457.48s)]
*  There's no evidence or any credible allegation or even any allegation from an official body [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=463.24s)]
*  that we have caused any individual at any time to come to harm in the past four years. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=469.6s)]
*  The Pentagon said that they've gone through all of these documents and they found the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=476.6s)]
*  names of 300 people. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=480.26s)]
*  That's new public information to us. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=482.6s)]
*  It's possible that there are 300 names in the publicly released Afghan material. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=485.7s)]
*  We don't pretend that that process is absolutely perfect. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=491.56s)]
*  We did hold back one in five documents for extra harm minimization review. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=495.8s)]
*  And we also improved our process. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  So when Iraq came around, there was not even a single name in it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=504.6s)]
*  I mean, there have been reports of people quoting Taliban leaders saying that they [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=508.8s)]
*  had the names of these people and that they were going to take retribution. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=513.0s)]
*  The Taliban is not a coherent outfit, but we don't say that it is absolutely impossible [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=517.44s)]
*  that anything we ever publish will ever result in harm. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=522.72s)]
*  We cannot say that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=529.1s)]
*  There's a perception on the part of some people who believe that your agenda right now is [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=530.4000000000001s)]
*  anti-American. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=535.22s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=536.22s)]

*  After the release of the State Department cables, Attorney General Eric Holder condemned [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=561.66s)]
*  WikiLeaks for putting national security at risk. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=565.84s)]

*  Holder announced that the Justice Department and the Pentagon were conducting a criminal [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=573.4399999999999s)]

*  Are you surprised? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=589.92s)]

*  You have made some of the most powerful people in the world your enemies. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=598.98s)]

*  released them to the world on the internet. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=614.96s)]
*  They see that as a threat. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=618.08s)]
*  They see it as highly embarrassing. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=620.98s)]

*  Someone in the Australian government said that, look, if you play outside the rules, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=639.9s)]
*  you can't expect to be protected by the rules. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=644.06s)]
*  You played outside the rules. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=646.66s)]
*  You've played outside the United States' rules. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=649.1s)]
*  No. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=653.1s)]

*  And there's been no precedent that I'm aware of in the past 50 years of prosecuting a publisher [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=694.6600000000001s)]
*  for espionage. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=702.62s)]

*  Those are the rules. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=705.94s)]
*  You do not do it. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=706.94s)]
*  No one has accused Assange of stealing secrets. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=708.1s)]
*  The Apache video and the classified documents were allegedly provided to WikiLeaks by private [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=711.02s)]
*  first class Bradley Manning, a low-level intelligence analyst in Iraq who is accused of copying [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=716.86s)]
*  them from a classified government network that a half a million people have access to. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=723.34s)]
*  Manning is now in solitary confinement at a military prison in Virginia facing charges [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=729.02s)]
*  that could put him away for 50 years. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=734.14s)]
*  You've called him a prisoner of conscience, correct? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=737.3s)]
*  I've said that if the allegations against him are true, then he is the foremost prisoner [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=740.4599999999999s)]
*  of conscience in the United States. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=748.86s)]
*  There's no allegation it was done for money. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=750.9s)]
*  There's no allegation it's done for any other reason than a political reason. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=752.8199999999999s)]
*  Now I'm sorry if people in the United States don't want to believe that they are keeping [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=757.02s)]
*  a political prisoner, but in Bradley Manning's case the allegations are that he engaged in [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=761.78s)]
*  illegal activity for political motivations. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=767.9s)]
*  People in the United States think he's a traitor. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=772.0600000000001s)]
*  That's clearly not true. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=774.94s)]
*  Regardless of what happens to Private Manning, any prosecution of Assange will be fraught [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=776.74s)]
*  with problems because WikiLeaks wasn't alone in publishing the classified material. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=781.3s)]
*  The New York Times also published some of it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=786.7s)]
*  If the government were to try and prosecute WikiLeaks and not the Times, it would likely [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=789.34s)]
*  need to prove that Assange was actively involved in a conspiracy to illegally obtain the documents. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=794.14s)]
*  Did you encourage anyone to leak this material to you or have you done anything in connection [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=800.6999999999999s)]
*  with the U.S. cases in terms of encouraging an individual to provide you with material? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=805.46s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=810.6999999999999s)]
*  There are people that believe that it has everything to do with the next threat, that [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=811.9s)]
*  come after you now, that what they have done is essentially endorsed a small, powerful [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=817.46s)]
*  organization with access to very powerful information, releasing it outside their control. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=824.74s)]
*  If they let you get away with it, then they are encouraging... [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=832.5400000000001s)]
*  Then they will have to have freedom of the press. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=835.5s)]
*  Then they will encourage that it's encouragement to you or to some other organization. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=837.0600000000001s)]
*  To every other publisher. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=843.82s)]
*  Absolutely correct. It will be encouragement to every other publisher to publish fearlessly. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=845.06s)]
*  That's what it will encourage. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=851.26s)]
*  To publish information much more dangerous than this information. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=852.26s)]
*  If we're talking about creating threats to small publishers to stop them publishing, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=857.06s)]
*  the U.S. has lost its way. It has abrogated its founding traditions. It has thrown the [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=863.6199999999999s)]
*  First Amendment in the bin because publishers must be free to publish. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=869.94s)]
*  When we come back, Julian Assange talks about his background, his political beliefs, and [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=877.4200000000001s)]
*  some of the things he says are stored in the WikiLeaks computer, including potentially [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=882.0200000000001s)]
*  damaging information about American banks. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=886.34s)]
*  Julian Assange is not your average journalist or publisher, and some have argued that he's [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=900.94s)]
*  not really a journalist at all. He is an anti-establishment ideologue with conspiratorial views. He believes [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=905.58s)]
*  large government institutions use secrecy to suppress the truth, and he distrusts the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=913.1800000000001s)]
*  mainstream media for playing along. Some people have called him an anarchist, which he denies. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=918.46s)]
*  Assange prefers to be called a libertarian and believes that the only people who can [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=924.0600000000001s)]
*  adequately police the system are those on the inside who are in a position to notice [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=928.82s)]
*  the abuse and blow the whistle. While most reporters pride themselves in gathering information [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=933.5400000000001s)]
*  and interpreting it for a larger audience, the WikiLeaks model is different. It prefers [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=939.46s)]
*  to take raw data, make it available, and let others decide the meaning. Regardless of whether [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=944.6600000000001s)]
*  you agree with this idea or not, it beats close to the heart of the internet and a younger [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=950.2800000000001s)]
*  generation, and it runs through the life of Julian Assange. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=955.22s)]
*  You obviously have a mistrust of authority. Where does that come from? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=960.02s)]
*  I think it comes from experience with various types of authorities. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=965.02s)]
*  Assange gave us an example from his childhood, a story about him and his mother Christine, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=970.86s)]
*  who was present at one of his recent court hearings. She was a political activist who [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=976.4200000000001s)]
*  helped scientists gather information about nuclear tests conducted by the British in [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=980.92s)]
*  the Australian outback. He remembers them being stopped late one night in question by [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=985.9599999999999s)]
*  authorities, one of whom said... [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=991.9599999999999s)]
*  Look, lady, you're out at 2 a.m. in the morning with this child. It could be suggested you're [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=993.24s)]
*  unfit, mother. I suggest you stay out of politics, and which you did for the next 10 years in [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=999.52s)]
*  order to make sure nothing happened to me. So that's a very early abuse of power and [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1005.64s)]
*  of secrecy that I saw in my life. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1014.04s)]
*  His was an unconventional and sometimes tumultuous childhood. He was frequently uprooted and [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1017.3199999999999s)]
*  moved around the countryside and attended 37 different schools. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1023.08s)]
*  So you've always been a little bit of an outsider. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1027.68s)]
*  I've certainly, when I was a child, going from one school to another, you are the outsider [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1030.72s)]
*  to begin with and you have to find your way in. But in most of the places where I stayed [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1036.4s)]
*  for long enough, I did find my way in. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1043.76s)]
*  One of the first places Assange found his way into was populated by teenagers and computers, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1046.24s)]
*  and he knew how to program them before most people had them. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1052.24s)]
*  You got involved with computers pretty early, with hacking. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1055.92s)]
*  I first became involved with computers when I was 13 or so, and I was unusually adept. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1061.24s)]
*  I saw a sort of intellectual opportunity, understanding how to program and understanding [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1068.24s)]
*  how these complex machines work. And that was part of a social culture in cracking codes [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1073.8400000000001s)]
*  to prove that you could do it. It was very actually normal and healthy amongst young [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1081.84s)]
*  men. You see it in skateboarders that are competing to show that they are capable in [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1087.0s)]
*  learning the best tricks. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1092.8799999999999s)]
*  And your tricks were like breaking into computers at the Department of Defense in Los Alamos, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1094.32s)]
*  National Laboratory, NASA, Nortel, some Canadian banks? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1099.32s)]
*  All that happened. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1104.0s)]
*  At age 20, Assange was arrested by the Australian Federal Police and eventually pled guilty [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1105.12s)]

*  the judge concluded that he hadn't stolen any information or done any damage. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1116.0s)]
*  Is that still one of your primary skills? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1121.2399999999998s)]
*  Not really. Unfortunately, I've been promoted up into management, so I don't get to do that [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1124.9599999999998s)]
*  much. But I know the terrain, which means I know what is possible. For example, Bill [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1131.96s)]
*  Gates could program, but he certainly doesn't program anymore. But he knows what is possible [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1138.44s)]
*  for other people to do. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1143.76s)]
*  Except that Assange is not Bill Gates and WikiLeaks is not Microsoft. The shoestring [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1145.88s)]
*  operation that created all the havoc has no permanent offices and is headquartered wherever [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1151.08s)]
*  Assange happens to be. WikiLeaks is a small nonprofit organization with a handful of employees, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1156.8799999999999s)]
*  a secret cadre of international programmers and a legion of worldwide volunteers. Its [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1163.12s)]
*  finances are administered by the Val Holland Foundation, based in Berlin and named after [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1169.6799999999998s)]
*  a famous hacker. According to its ledgers, WikiLeaks took in $1.3 million last year in [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1174.96s)]
*  donations with expenses of about $500,000. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1181.34s)]
*  For somebody who abhors secrets, you run a pretty secret organization. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1184.56s)]
*  That's not true. What we want is transparent government, not transparent people. We are [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1190.8s)]
*  an organization who, one of our primary goals is to keep certain things secret, to keep [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1199.0s)]
*  the identities of sources secret. Secrecy is an inherent part of our operation. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1206.44s)]
*  The State Department would make the same argument. They are doing very sensitive work, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1212.96s)]
*  that they are trying to make peace and negotiate situations around the world very delicately. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1219.08s)]
*  It's important that they do this in secrecy. What's the difference? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1223.76s)]
*  We don't say that the State Department should have no secrets. That's not what we say. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1227.64s)]
*  Rather we say that if there are people in the State Department who say that there is [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1232.76s)]
*  some abuse going on and there's not a proper mechanism for internal accountability and [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1237.16s)]
*  external accountability, they must have a conduit to get that out to the public. And [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1242.44s)]
*  we are the conduit. Given all the attention that Assange has received, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1247.92s)]
*  we were curious about how he thought he was being perceived in the United States. He told [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1252.5s)]
*  us he hasn't had the time to give it much thought. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1257.16s)]
*  Do you want me to give you my characterization of what I think people think? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1259.56s)]
*  Sure. Mysterious, little weird, occult-like figure. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1263.44s)]
*  Little paranoid. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1270.44s)]
*  You're repeating all the ad hominem attacks by our critics. My role when I do something [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1274.4s)]
*  like speak about that we have discovered the deaths of 109,000 individual people in Iraq, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1282.56s)]
*  15,000 civilian casualties never before reported anywhere. That's a very serious role. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1290.6000000000001s)]
*  That is not a role where I can engage in humor. So I'm not used to performing under [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1297.6s)]
*  the spotlight and I'm learning this as time is going by. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1310.0s)]
*  You have shown a fair amount of contempt for the mainstream press over the years. Why did [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1313.6799999999998s)]
*  you decide to, as you use the word, partner with them in some of these most recent releases? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1318.52s)]
*  We're a small organization. We're in a position, say with Cablegate, where we have 3,000 volumes [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1326.4s)]
*  of material that are very important to get out to the public in a responsible manner, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1333.96s)]
*  that have the potential for great change. For example, this recent revolution in Tunisia. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1340.56s)]
*  It is logistically impossible. So instead, our organization delegates its excess source [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1345.52s)]
*  material to other journalists who will have more impact and who will do a better job. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1353.52s)]
*  There is an element of the press, most of the mainstream press, nobody wants to see [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1362.12s)]
*  you prosecuted because it could affect the way that they do their business. But there's [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1366.5s)]
*  also a feeling within the community that you're not one of them, that you play a different [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1371.28s)]
*  game. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1379.72s)]
*  We do play a different game and I hope we're a new way. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1380.8400000000001s)]
*  The point that they're making, I think, is that you're a publisher but you're also an [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1384.28s)]
*  activist. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1390.64s)]
*  We're a particular type of activist. In the US context, there seems to be communist activists [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1391.48s)]
*  or something. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1398.52s)]
*  Right, agitator. Somebody who's more interested in... [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1399.28s)]
*  It's a dirty word in the US. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1402.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a dirty word. People think that what you're trying to do is to sabotage the workings [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1403.52s)]
*  of government. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1409.58s)]
*  No. We're not that type of activists. We are free press activists. It's not about saving [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1410.46s)]
*  the whales. It's about giving people the information they need to support whaling or not support [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1419.1799999999998s)]
*  whaling. Why? That is the raw ingredients that is needed to make a just and civil society. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1426.34s)]
*  Without that, you're just sailing in the dark. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1433.5s)]
*  There have been clear signs that Assange, under the threat of possible indictment by [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1436.6599999999999s)]
*  the Justice Department, has moderated some of his views. Before releasing the last two [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1440.4599999999998s)]
*  batches of classified documents, Assange and his lawyers contacted both the Pentagon and [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1445.6599999999999s)]
*  the State Department, offering to explore ways to minimize potential harm. In both cases, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1451.2199999999998s)]
*  their offer was rebuffed. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1457.58s)]
*  Assange acknowledged that his fundraising has been hurt by the decision of PayPal, MasterCard, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1459.4599999999998s)]
*  Visa and Bank of America to cease handling donations, but he dismissed reports that WikiLeaks [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1465.26s)]
*  is wracked by internal dissension and mass defections. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1471.26s)]
*  We're talking about Daniel Domscheit-Berg, who was a German spokesperson, had a limited [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1475.06s)]
*  role in the organization. We had to suspend him some five months ago. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1480.98s)]
*  He describes you as being authoritarian, secretive, punitive. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1486.54s)]
*  I'm the boss that suspended him. That's correct. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1490.9s)]
*  You don't care to elaborate? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1495.06s)]
*  I think I just did. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1497.02s)]
*  You said you have this package of very damaging documents, sort of a poison pill that's going [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1499.82s)]
*  to be released if anything bad happens to you. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1506.74s)]
*  That's not at all true. That's some kind of media hype. What we do have is a system whereby [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1509.6599999999999s)]
*  we distribute encrypted backups of things we have yet to publish. There are backups [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1517.3s)]
*  distributed amongst many, many people, 100,000 people, and that all we need to do is give [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1522.4599999999998s)]
*  them an encrypted key and they will be able to continue on. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1530.62s)]
*  This wasn't intended to be a blackmail threat? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1535.22s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1538.54s)]
*  What would trigger that encryption code being released? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1539.26s)]
*  Anything that prevented us from our ability to publish. So not just for a second, but [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1540.8999999999999s)]
*  prevented us significantly from being able to publish. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1548.9s)]
*  Your imprisonment, for example? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1554.5s)]
*  If a number of people were imprisoned or assassinated, then we would feel that we could not go on [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1556.5400000000002s)]
*  and other people would have to take over our work and we would release those keys. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1569.5400000000002s)]
*  In Bank of America, had its stock go down 3 to 5 percent based on a rumor, maybe it's [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1574.26s)]
*  a rumor, maybe you know more about it, that you had the contents of a 5 gigabyte hard [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1581.42s)]
*  drive belonging to one of its executives. Do you have a 5 gigabyte hard drive? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1588.5s)]
*  I won't make any comment in relation to that upcoming publication. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1593.06s)]
*  You're certainly not denying it? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1598.26s)]
*  There would be a process of elimination if we denied some and admitted others. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1599.54s)]
*  So it might not be Bank of America and you're just going to let them squirm until you get [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1607.02s)]
*  ready to... [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1610.8999999999999s)]
*  I think it's great to have all these banks squirming thinking maybe it's them. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1611.82s)]
*  You seem to enjoy stirring things up. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1614.98s)]
*  When you see abusive organisations suffer the consequences as a result of their abuse [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1621.18s)]
*  and you see victims elevated, yes, that's a very pleasurable activity to be involved [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1627.6200000000001s)]
*  in. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1633.6200000000001s)]

*  in the world and in the process of doing that you have now become powerful yourself. Who [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1638.8600000000001s)]
*  is the check on you? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1644.78s)]
*  It is our sources who choose to provide us with information or not depending on how they [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1646.66s)]
*  see our actions. It is our donors who choose to give us money or not. This organisation [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1654.02s)]
*  cannot survive for more than a few months without the ongoing support of the public. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1661.66s)]
*  A story about someone named Reality Winner has got to start with the name. Her father, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1683.66s)]
*  playing on the family name, explained he wanted a real winner and so reality. Maybe that still [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1699.74s)]
*  doesn't make sense, but it is the least baffling fact in this story. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1706.46s)]
*  Reality Winner became an infamous name in 2017 when she was accused of espionage. She [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1712.14s)]
*  was hit with the longest sentence ever imposed on a civilian for leaking classified information [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1718.3000000000002s)]

*  Did Reality Winner do exceptionally grave damage as the prosecutor said, or did she [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1731.26s)]
*  reveal a truth that defended America? It's complicated, just like the young woman with [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1737.9s)]
*  the unforgettable name. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1744.3000000000002s)]
*  I am not a traitor. I am not a spy. I am somebody who only acted out of love for what this country [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1747.26s)]
*  stands for. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1760.3000000000002s)]
*  She met 30-year-old Reality Winner at home in Texas after four years behind bars. Espionage [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1762.98s)]

*  Medal in 2016 for quote, 600 enemies killed in action. She did that as a linguist in a [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1777.34s)]

*  Maryland. Why are you at Fort Meade? Not...am I allowed to say that? Nope. Nope. That's [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1805.86s)]

*  she said, you know, when you're watching somebody on your screen and that person goes poof, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1845.46s)]
*  you've got to make sure that you've got everything right. I was starting to see in the news that [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1853.3400000000001s)]
*  our mission had a very high civilian casualty rating. She began to feel guilt while battling [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1860.78s)]
*  illness, depression and the eating disorder bulimia. She left the Air Force for a top [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1867.78s)]

*  Russia. Could have been China. Could have been a lot of different groups. But it was [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1907.14s)]
*  Russia and the NSA knew it. Reality Winner had seen proof in a top secret report on an [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1910.74s)]

*  put this right. Somebody. The secret report said in 2016, the Russian [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1925.38s)]

*  officials involved in the management of voter registration systems. It was top secret in [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1940.7s)]
*  part because it revealed what the U.S. knew about Russian tactics. Winner told us she [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1947.2s)]
*  was exposing a White House cover-up. She printed the report, dropped it in this mailbox addressed [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1952.86s)]
*  anonymously to an online news source that specialized in government wrongdoing. The [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1960.6999999999998s)]
*  NSA report was published a month later. You knew it was stamped top secret. You knew what [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1967.02s)]
*  that meant. I knew that. I knew it was secret. But I also knew that I had pledged service [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1973.4199999999998s)]
*  to the American people. And at that point in time, it felt like they were being led [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1980.6200000000001s)]
*  astray. Winner was caught as soon as the top secret [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1985.94s)]
*  report surfaced. The NSA could see on its network that she printed it. She drove home [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1989.6200000000001s)]
*  to a new reality. A plain black sedan came up behind my car [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=1996.78s)]
*  and two men in polo shirts came out and introduced themselves as FBI agents. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2002.18s)]
*  A transcript shows the FBI agents told her the interrogation was voluntary and they didn't [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2008.06s)]
*  mention her right to an attorney. Winner lied about mailing the report, then confessed, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2013.86s)]
*  and was arrested. The government hit her with the most serious possible charge, espionage. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2020.9s)]
*  Bail was denied after prosecutors told a judge that Winner wrote in her diary that she was [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2026.98s)]
*  mad enough to burn the White House. They suggested she might defect to the Taliban. To the public, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2032.6200000000001s)]
*  they said this. Winner's willful, purposeful disclosure caused [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2040.22s)]
*  exceptionally grave damage to U.S. national security. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2044.8600000000001s)]
*  But what prosecutors called grave damage was a bombshell of truth to the Federal Election [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2049.06s)]
*  Assistance Commission, which helped secure the vote. In hours, the commission issued [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2055.46s)]
*  an alert on the NSA document leak. It spelled out the top-secret email addresses utilized [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2061.7s)]
*  by the attackers and urged officials to check email logs. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2068.62s)]
*  Blindsided by Winner's revelation, the commission called for full disclosure of election security [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2074.1s)]
*  intelligence. Two former officials told us reality Winner helped secure the 2018 midterm [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2081.26s)]
*  election. One of the things that you learned about the [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2089.26s)]
*  espionage charge is that in court you're not allowed to talk about what you leaked or why [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2093.38s)]
*  you leaked it. What would you have told the judge? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2099.94s)]
*  That I thought this was the truth, but also did not betray our sources and methods, did [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2105.1400000000003s)]
*  not cause damage, did not put lives on the line. It only filled in a question mark that [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2112.14s)]
*  was tearing our country in half in May 2017, and that I meant no harm. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2119.9s)]
*  But there was harm. For her. As her case dragged on 16 months, she says depression was consuming [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2127.54s)]
*  her. Her mother moved from Texas to Augusta to be with her daughter. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2134.54s)]
*  There would just be times when it almost wasn't worth it to see the end of this. And so... [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2139.54s)]
*  You had thoughts of taking your own life? Yes. I started to plan my suicide, and I would [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2151.2599999999998s)]

*  The only thing that was stopping me was my mom, because she was still in Augusta. My [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2170.06s)]
*  dad had gone back to Texas to go to work, and I just refused to let her hear that news [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2179.18s)]
*  by herself. So I would get on the phone and just try to talk around it, and hey, there's [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2185.86s)]
*  no need to stick around, visitation's not worth it, go back to Texas, just go. Just [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2192.86s)]
*  go. Her mother, Billy, heard that while sitting [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2199.78s)]
*  in on our interview with her daughter. Reality told us that she was planning to kill herself. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2203.26s)]
*  I heard that. Yeah. Did you know she was in that much trouble? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2213.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, there were some very dark days, but then they would be followed by a better day. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2220.7s)]
*  I just knew when I was there in Georgia, I couldn't leave. I couldn't leave her. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2234.54s)]
*  In 2018, at the age of 26, Winter pleaded guilty. The judge said he would make an example [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2241.2999999999997s)]
*  of her. She served four years behind bars plus three now, answering to a probation officer. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2247.78s)]
*  She still can't talk about the case. I've had four years of just trying to say, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2255.94s)]
*  I'm not a terrorist. I can't even begin to talk about my actual espionage indictment, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2261.3s)]
*  or have a sense of accomplishment in having survived prison, because I'm still stained [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2269.3s)]
*  by them accusing me of being the same groups that I enlisted in the Air Force to fight [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2277.34s)]
*  against. So I don't let myself feel anything regarding the actual act or the charge until [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2285.34s)]
*  I can let it be known that I'm not what they said I was. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2293.34s)]

*  murder of George Floyd. In a cell with two companions, depression and bulimia, she became [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2305.98s)]
*  self-destructive. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2313.1800000000003s)]
*  Every time that I had to give in to my illness, I put it on my body. I cut it off. I was like, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2315.46s)]
*  I put it on my body. I cut myself. Everywhere. I couldn't leave my cell. I couldn't work [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2320.78s)]
*  out. And all I could do was ask why and ask why. And a chaplain walked by. And I asked [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2328.06s)]
*  him why they were doing this to us. And that same chaplain that I had seen for two years [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2336.2200000000003s)]

*  I started getting high that day. Everyone knows there's drugs in prison. I was reduced [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2348.8199999999997s)]
*  to binging and purging, getting high every day, and cutting myself. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2355.8199999999997s)]

*  also said Alexis had a blackout fueled by anger, but there's no record any investigator [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2634.54s)]
*  pursued that police report. That kind of violent behavior, that problem [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2640.8s)]
*  of impulse control, that should be a prime signal that this person is not, repeat, not [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2645.74s)]

*  of Personnel Management, known as the OPM. OPM sends the results of its investigations [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2664.3999999999996s)]
*  to the various federal agencies and those agencies decide whether to grant the security [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2670.96s)]
*  clearance. Demand is enormous. More than four million Americans have security clearances [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2676.08s)]
*  and OPM conducts 600,000 security clearance investigations a year. That comes to about [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2683.0s)]
*  2,000 a day. After 9-11, the number of people who gained [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2690.08s)]
*  security clearances grew rapidly, in fact tripled since 9-11 and today. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2694.96s)]
*  Was OPM prepared for that? There was an enormous backlog of security clearance [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2700.58s)]
*  investigations and Congress decided that getting rid of that backlog and increasing the pace [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2705.1s)]
*  with which investigations could be conducted was very, very important, was a top priority. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2710.92s)]
*  We literally had stacks of files sitting on the floors because we had no more places to [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2717.14s)]
*  put them. Brenda Parsons, Kathy Trees and Linda Day [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2721.06s)]
*  were three of the people at the Department of Defense who granted or denied clearances [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2724.2599999999998s)]
*  based on the investigations of the Office of Personnel Management. They were called [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2729.6s)]
*  adjudicators, and they have recently retired. I consider OPM to be the JV of background [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2734.52s)]
*  investigations. Not the varsity team? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2741.7599999999998s)]
*  Not the varsity team. They told us that OPM's investigations often [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2744.12s)]
*  had major omissions. Some even skipped the required interview with the person applying [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2748.7599999999998s)]
*  for the clearance. The Office of Personnel Management says, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2755.2s)]
*  look, if there's a problem with the file, send it back. We'll work on it again. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2759.48s)]
*  We'd be sending the majority of them back. Nobody would ever get a clearance. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2765.16s)]
*  The files were that defective? Yeah, they were that defective. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2769.3599999999997s)]
*  Another defective file involved Army Private Bradley Manning. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2773.8799999999997s)]
*  Did you have any reason to doubt Manning's loyalty to the United States? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2778.8599999999997s)]
*  In 2009, Jerlea Shoman was Manning's supervisor in an intelligence unit headed to Iraq. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2784.96s)]
*  I pointed to the patch of our American flag that was on my shoulder. I said, what does [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2791.96s)]
*  this flag mean to you? He said, it means absolutely nothing to me. I hold no allegiance to this [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2796.96s)]
*  country and the people in it. How does he get a top secret security clearance? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2802.24s)]
*  That is a good question. Manning's security clearance investigation [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2806.92s)]
*  failed to check a complaint that his stepmother made with Oklahoma City Police. If they had, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2811.8s)]
*  they might have heard her 911 call. My husband's 18-year-old son is out of control [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2818.96s)]
*  and is threatening me with a knife. If investigators had checked his enlistment [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2823.96s)]
*  papers, they might have seen that he wrote that he joined the military to sort out the [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2828.84s)]
*  turmoil and mess in my life. Before Manning's top secret clearance was granted, he stabbed [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2833.88s)]
*  a soldier with a pencil and was ordered into counseling for fits of rage. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2840.44s)]
*  I went directly to my superior. And told them what? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2845.0s)]
*  I said that he cannot be trusted with security clearance. We can't deploy him and he's most [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2848.16s)]
*  likely a spy. Jerlea Shoman told us that her superior said [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2853.04s)]
*  they couldn't afford to lose a man with a valuable top secret clearance. In Iraq, she [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2857.52s)]
*  says that she confronted Manning after he repeatedly violated the rules, including sneaking a camera [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2864.16s)]
*  and recordable CDs into this high security intelligence vault. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2870.7000000000003s)]
*  And he screamed no at the top of his lungs and came and punched me right in the face [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2875.2200000000003s)]
*  and body slammed me at the same time. So I put him in a hold and I asked him if this [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2880.86s)]
*  is what he wants. And he said he's just tired of everybody watching his activities. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2885.26s)]
*  This guy has done multiple things at this point that a soldier could be court-martialed [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2890.6600000000003s)]
*  for. Yes. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2896.74s)]
*  He's a train wreck. Yes. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2898.9399999999996s)]
*  And his security clearance never gets pulled? Correct. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2901.9399999999996s)]
*  Over eight months, Manning used the CDs to record hundreds of thousands of secrets in [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2906.3399999999997s)]
*  that vault and delivered them to the website WikiLeaks. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2912.2599999999998s)]
*  I was sick. But it didn't surprise me. Because I knew it all along. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2916.2599999999998s)]
*  Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison where she is now known as Chelsea Manning, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2923.7400000000002s)]
*  a transgender woman. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2929.42s)]
*  In 2009, Linda Day's office at the Pentagon relied on OPM investigations of soldiers like [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2931.94s)]
*  Manning to decide whether to grant security clearances. But Day began to suspect problems [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2938.0600000000004s)]
*  with the FBI name check, a search the FBI does of its criminal database at the request [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2945.1800000000003s)]
*  of OPM. Day saw cases where clearances were granted before the results from the FBI were [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2951.7s)]
*  complete. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2958.8999999999996s)]
*  I was alerted to a potential problem when all of a sudden an investigation that OPM [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2959.74s)]
*  had closed over a year before now included classified information from the FBI name check. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2966.7799999999997s)]
*  How important was that piece of information, that FBI report, in making an adjudication? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2974.78s)]
*  I thought it was probably the most important lead in an investigation. I mean, considering [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2984.34s)]
*  that an adjudicator is to try to determine whether a subject is loyal to the United States, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2991.02s)]
*  the kinds of crimes that the FBI investigates, sabotage, espionage, terrorism, that's what [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=2997.36s)]
*  that lead told us. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3004.7200000000003s)]
*  Linda Day wasn't the only one who was suspicious. The federal investigator looking into Aaron [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3006.36s)]
*  Alexis' case wrote in his report that the FBI name checks appeared curious. So, as a [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3011.56s)]
*  test, he decided to examine at random top-secret security clearance investigations for translators [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3019.1600000000003s)]
*  who were working in Iraq and Afghanistan. He wrote, we reviewed the investigative files [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3026.16s)]
*  of ten. The OPM's report showed that none of the subjects had an FBI file when in fact [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3032.48s)]
*  there were FBI records on quote, seven of the ten. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3039.3599999999997s)]
*  Are there people today who have clearances and should not have them? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3045.52s)]
*  Yes. We have spies in our midst. I'm convinced of it. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3049.3199999999997s)]
*  John Hamry is a former deputy secretary of defense who chairs the defense policy board [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3053.08s)]
*  that advises the Pentagon. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3058.52s)]
*  Our system is very obsolete in my view. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3060.6s)]
*  Obsolete, Hamry says, because the foundation of each investigation is a questionnaire called [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3063.3199999999997s)]
*  a standard form 86, which the applicant fills out himself. Aaron Alexis got away with lying [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3069.58s)]
*  on the form about his gun-related arrest and Manning lied about his mental health. Also, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3076.9s)]
*  regulations don't allow investigators to search the applicant's social media because of privacy [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3083.9s)]
*  concerns. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3090.2599999999998s)]
*  It's amazing what people will say on their Facebook account that they don't say on a [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3091.42s)]
*  security clearance. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3096.58s)]
*  Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency contractor who pulled off the biggest theft [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3098.46s)]
*  of U.S. secrets ever, had a background investigation no better than Manning's or Aaron Alexis's. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3103.82s)]
*  And when we have failures, they're catastrophic. The failure with Snowden was catastrophic. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3110.9s)]
*  So our big, elaborate, expensive system didn't prevent something that was truly important. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3116.34s)]
*  We've obtained this internal memo that has not been public before. It's a warning to [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3123.82s)]
*  the head of the Office of Personnel Management from the man who investigates the agency, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3129.22s)]
*  OPM's Inspector General Patrick McFarland. It was written in 2013. McFarland writes that [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3134.3799999999997s)]
*  Snowden's background investigation was deficient in a number of areas, and OPM itself did not [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3141.54s)]
*  identify that the report had glaring deficiencies. McFarland concludes, there may well be systemic [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3148.7799999999997s)]
*  problems. We've learned that Snowden's behavior raised concerns when he worked at the CIA, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3156.7400000000002s)]
*  and when he left the agency, the CIA put a red flag in his file in case Snowden applied [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3163.46s)]
*  for another job. He did, a civilian job for the NSA where he stole the secrets. Snowden [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3169.2200000000003s)]
*  had found a simple way to beat OPM's review of his security clearance. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3176.5800000000004s)]
*  In the section about his job history, he said that his previous job was classified [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3182.38s)]
*  and he didn't give any more details. OPM did not verify his previous employment as a result [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3187.46s)]
*  of that. Obviously after the fact, it was a great mistake. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3194.54s)]
*  What would you say is the greatest insider threat that we face as a result of the way [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3199.46s)]
*  these security clearances are done? Snowden was an example of it. He moved into [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3205.2200000000003s)]
*  an enormously sensitive position. We control people at the gate. Once we give them a credential, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3211.14s)]
*  they're in the compound. We don't pay attention to where they are after that. We don't organize [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3219.46s)]

*  deficiencies in Snowden's background investigation because the U.S. intends to prosecute if he [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLI-tzJB540&t=3234.66s)]
