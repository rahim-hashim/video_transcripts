# Remembering 9/11 | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [September 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw)
*  On 9-11, Dr. Benjamin Luff prepared Stony Brook University Medical Center on Long Island [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=0.0s)]
*  for the massive number of casualties he expected to overwhelm the emergency room. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=18.7s)]
*  But none came through the door that day. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  So few had survived. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=26.7s)]
*  As it turned out, Dr. Luff's casualties were coming, but they would arrive much later. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=28.84s)]
*  Although nearly 3,000 people were killed at the World Trade Center, 70,000 others responded [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=33.96s)]
*  to Ground Zero and worked for months amid toxic smoke and dust. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=40.12s)]
*  Dr. Luff helped start a clinic to treat the chronic illnesses and psychological trauma [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  suffered by the 9-11 responders. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=50.28s)]
*  Over time, Luff discovered something that he never expected. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=53.08s)]
*  He began to hear their stories, honest, raw, irreplaceable stories. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=57.4s)]
*  And almost two years ago, he began to record the definitive history of Ground Zero, remembering [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=63.28s)]
*  9-11 in the words of the people who lived it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=69.96s)]
*  The problem that came up was that our society began to look at the responders in terms of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=74.58s)]
*  their disease. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=79.28s)]
*  They became an issue in terms of their liability. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=80.88s)]
*  My feeling was that that's not who the responders were. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=85.68s)]
*  Let's find out who they are as human beings, what their motivation was, what values they [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=88.72000000000001s)]
*  had, what sacrifices they made, how they were able to renew themselves. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=94.12s)]
*  It was almost like taking a civics class as to what is important about being a citizen. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  What is important about being a human being? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=107.28s)]
*  What is important to being an American? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=109.64000000000001s)]
*  I worked at the makeshift morgue. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=112.56s)]
*  We took in all the bodies. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=116.96s)]
*  You know, saying I'm sorry for your loss was very difficult because I almost got to be [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=123.8s)]
*  like a roach. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=130.4s)]
*  Stacy Goodman, a police detective, is one of the voices Dr. Luff recorded in what is [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=133.0s)]
*  now called the World Trade Center Oral History Project. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=138.28s)]
*  At one point, this senior, I think he was a retired fireman, he comes in, his hands [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=142.28s)]
*  are cupped, and he's got bones in his hands. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=149.72s)]
*  And he goes over to the medical examiner, he puts the bones in front of him, he goes, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=154.84s)]
*  this is my son. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=158.12s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=159.12s)]
*  No one could possibly know 9-11 the way these people do. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=168.12s)]
*  We asked several of the responders to give us a sense of the hours of testimony that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=176.0s)]
*  they've put into Dr. Luff's project. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=180.56s)]
*  The debris and the people rushing out at us, I couldn't even make it to Tower 1. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=183.04s)]
*  I made it to the base of Tower 2. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=189.32s)]
*  Carol Palkner was a cop on the scene before the towers fell. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=192.16s)]
*  This big, brawly FBI guy had his shield around his neck, and I looked up at him and he's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=196.72s)]
*  telling there's about six officers there with me, and he's like, if you want to live, you [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  might as well leave now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=211.4s)]
*  He said, we're all going to die. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=213.24s)]
*  I'm like, we can't leave. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=215.68s)]
*  I'm not leaving. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=217.56s)]
*  And the officers that I were there with, we're not leaving either, and we continue to evacuate [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=219.32s)]
*  and do our jobs, but we were all like, wow, we're going to die. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=224.76s)]
*  Palkner was trapped when the first tower collapsed. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=230.44s)]
*  That's her on the left after she pulled herself out of the wreckage. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=233.32s)]
*  She's with a fellow cop and a woman that they rescued. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=237.76s)]
*  I was one of the guys that were able to pull somebody out alive. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=241.04s)]
*  So few were saved, but police Sergeant Richard Doyler helped pull out one rare survivor, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=243.9s)]
*  a fellow cop named John McLaughlin. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=250.0s)]
*  And I was giving John McLaughlin morphine because the plan was that if we couldn't [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  extricate him, then we were going to cut his legs off. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=260.76s)]
*  John screamed in pain when we pulled him initially, so we let him rest and we simultaneously pulled [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=264.68s)]
*  again and we broke him free and pulled him out. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=273.68s)]
*  Boy, he takes some nice deep breaths. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  Benjamin Luft is a medical doctor who volunteered to help create a clinic for the 9-11 responders [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=287.2s)]
*  at Stony Brook University Medical Center, part of the State University of New York. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=293.32s)]
*  More than 6,000 responders enrolled in his World Trade Center health program. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=298.44s)]
*  One study shows that nearly a third of those who worked at Ground Zero have asthma. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=304.08s)]
*  42% suffer with sinusitis. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=309.4s)]
*  Nearly 40% have gastroesophageal reflux disease known as GERD. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  And many have reactive airways dysfunction syndrome that the patients just call RADS. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=317.94s)]
*  When you're a physician and you see patients, you tend to reduce them to their symptoms [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  and signs, to their medical conditions, and that's how you think of them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=330.96s)]
*  Luft listened to their stories in the examining room for eight years when he realized that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=334.4s)]
*  his patients were the authors of one of the most dramatic chapters of American history. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=340.0s)]
*  Your story of what happened on 9-11. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=346.12s)]
*  She became hysterical. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=349.7s)]
*  She had got a cell phone call that her, the Trade Center was hit with a plane. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=350.78s)]
*  With his own money, a few donations and a small mostly volunteer staff, Luft started [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=356.09999999999997s)]
*  his interviews. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=361.52s)]
*  So far, he's recorded 137. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=362.78s)]
*  When the building imploded down, it blew me out of the building and I was able to hold [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=367.55999999999995s)]
*  onto the doorway with my left arm. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=374.52s)]
*  The first thing I found was an entire body burned into rebar. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=376.9s)]
*  They put a line around my waist. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=383.82s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going in this way. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=386.85999999999996s)]
*  I'm just sneaking around on my belly around. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=388.9s)]
*  This is no way you can pull me out. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=390.62s)]
*  And a guy just looked at me. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=392.8s)]
*  It wasn't to pull us out. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=394.06s)]
*  It was just to find us if we died. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=396.82s)]
*  Where we expected to see two tall buildings, we just saw a skeleton. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=399.22s)]
*  The most powerful nation in the world. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=406.72s)]
*  How could this happen? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=409.62s)]
*  There's no clearer rendition of what happened at 9-11 than are in these histories. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=411.86s)]
*  Who are these people? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=416.92s)]
*  Of course, we have the firemen and the policemen and the EMS workers. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=418.7s)]
*  Then we have the volunteer firemen. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=424.62s)]
*  Then you have the iron workers and the construction workers and the laborers. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=426.58s)]
*  On 9-11, all Americans responded from all walks of life. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=430.65999999999997s)]
*  I was a senior in high school. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=436.62s)]
*  I realized that I have to go down there. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=438.53999999999996s)]
*  I don't know how I'm going to help. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=442.9s)]
*  I don't know what I can do. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=443.9s)]
*  My whole family is cops. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=445.9s)]
*  I'm the 13th in my family to be a New York City police officer. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=447.98s)]
*  I am a licensed massage therapist. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=452.82s)]
*  I just felt like I had to be down there helping these people knowing what I do for a living [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=456.02s)]
*  can help these people. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=460.6s)]
*  I work for the New York City Highway Department. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=461.6s)]
*  I, you know, road work, construction, stuff like that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=463.38s)]
*  Never trained for anything like this. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=466.82s)]
*  And I learned quick though. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=469.3s)]
*  We spent a few hours with some of the responders at Stony Brook University. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=472.14s)]
*  As we listened, we realized that for them, today, Sunday, isn't the 10th anniversary [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=476.86s)]
*  of something that happened. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=482.74s)]
*  It's the 10th year of something that never ends. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=484.46s)]
*  In a sense, it's always 9-11. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=487.94s)]
*  John Gallagher is a former New York City fire captain suffering with pulmonary fibrosis, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=490.78000000000003s)]

*  The World Trade Center is still claiming lives. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=499.82s)]
*  People have had their lives shortened. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=505.66s)]
*  People have lost their fathers, their mothers, to cancers, to lung diseases. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=508.38000000000005s)]
*  Anything that you can imagine, blood-borne diseases. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=516.26s)]
*  People are still dying. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=519.5600000000001s)]
*  Show of hands, how many of you have been living through medical problems as a result of the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=521.1s)]
*  work that you did in those days? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=527.58s)]

*  Bill, give me a sense of what you've been working through health-wise. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=534.0600000000001s)]

*  I literally have a bucket of about 20 medicines, a plastic bucket, that I have to take something [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=559.1s)]
*  during the day. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=565.34s)]
*  This is Bill Fisher. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=567.06s)]
*  He worked at Ground Zero for four months, and like thousands of others, he was covered [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=568.9399999999999s)]
*  in dust that contained carcinogens, asbestos, and toxins too numerous to list. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=573.72s)]
*  Ken George was there, too. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=579.8199999999999s)]
*  He helped recover human remains. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=581.6999999999999s)]
*  Ken, what has your health experience been? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=583.9s)]
*  Oh, I've got a list. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=586.06s)]
*  He's got a list, it sounds like. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=588.14s)]
*  It started with the 9-11 cough I had, which led me to have RADs, restricted airway disease, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=589.78s)]
*  which means I can't get enough oxygen in or out. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=596.58s)]
*  Like these people said, the sinuses, I have all that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=599.26s)]
*  So it's just snowballing out of control. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=603.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=605.1s)]
*  And who knows, five years down the line, if I'm going to want it with cancer. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=607.04s)]
*  I just want to make sure my family's taken care of, if anything happens. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=612.74s)]
*  I don't want them out in the street. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=617.22s)]
*  Any pain? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=619.74s)]
*  Paying their medical bills has been a struggle. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=621.62s)]
*  Funding for the World Trade Center health program was never certain until this year, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=624.22s)]
*  when Congress guaranteed coverage. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=628.98s)]
*  But that guarantee lasts only the next five years. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=631.22s)]
*  The illnesses and the mental trauma are likely to last a lifetime. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=635.1800000000001s)]
*  One thing nobody's mentioned, but we all have it, it's like luggage and we have it forever, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=640.5s)]
*  is the post-traumatic stress. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=644.6600000000001s)]
*  Tyree Bacon was a senior court officer who worked 10 blocks from the World Trade Center. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=647.42s)]
*  He reached the towers before they collapsed. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=652.66s)]
*  Those of us who wear uniforms make a living out of the worst 10 minutes of everybody's [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=655.98s)]
*  lives. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=658.98s)]
*  9-11 was a hell of a lot longer than 10 minutes long. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=659.98s)]
*  Post-traumatic stress is something that I have an issue with. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=664.46s)]
*  Spent a month after being caught in a collapse, waking up on the floor, trying to feel my [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=668.18s)]
*  way out of my own bedroom. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=673.94s)]
*  This is Tyree Bacon in the oral history project, remembering a woman who grabbed him by the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=676.98s)]
*  shirt as one of the towers fell. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=682.62s)]
*  I told her, I said, sweetheart, don't worry, I promise we're getting out of here. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=685.26s)]
*  I flat out lied to her, I thought we were going to die where we were. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=689.1s)]
*  If I didn't have her, I probably would have curled up in a fetal position and just waited [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=693.1800000000001s)]
*  to die. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=701.1s)]
*  When that responder went down to ground zero, they were experiencing traumatic events in [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=702.9s)]
*  rapid succession. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=712.74s)]
*  Buildings falling, girders falling, tripping, people jumping out of buildings, seeing tremendous [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=715.5799999999999s)]
*  amounts of carnage. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=721.42s)]
*  The fires. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=722.6999999999999s)]
*  The fires. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=723.6999999999999s)]
*  Now, it's not occurring over a 10-second period of time. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=724.6999999999999s)]
*  It's occurring over weeks and months. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=728.3s)]
*  And the same person is experiencing it over and over and over again. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=732.3s)]
*  The jumpers, I think, were the worst. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=736.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, to actually see them jump and pulverize just in front of you. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=739.02s)]
*  You know, that was just horrible. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=745.3s)]
*  There was a sound that that made. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=748.8599999999999s)]
*  That was, first I'm like, I didn't know what that sound was at first. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=751.9399999999999s)]
*  And then you go to see what that sound was and you realize that it was a person that [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=755.78s)]
*  just jumped. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=762.02s)]
*  If it's that bad up there that you have to jump, you know, a lot we couldn't see. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=763.02s)]
*  Almost invariably, people come to us afterwards and say, you know, Doc, this is the first [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=770.98s)]
*  time that I've been able to talk about this. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=777.66s)]
*  This is the first time that I can tell others what really happened on 9-11. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=781.0600000000001s)]
*  In the three months that I was there, we found very, very few victims. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=786.5s)]
*  We found pieces, but not bodies. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=793.86s)]
*  That was the first time I ever spoke of my experiences at 9-11. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=799.38s)]
*  I found it therapeutic. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=803.4200000000001s)]
*  How many years was it that you didn't talk about 9-11? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=805.6600000000001s)]
*  Seven years. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=810.1800000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=811.1800000000001s)]
*  I didn't want to replay it. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=812.1800000000001s)]
*  I didn't want to, you know, I lived it. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=813.62s)]
*  I didn't want to relive it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=815.38s)]
*  I didn't think it was such a great idea because I think a lot of us buried that day. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=816.94s)]
*  Christine Famoletti was a New York City cop, now retired. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=821.02s)]
*  And to really bring it up and hash it up again and really discuss in depth was a little, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=824.98s)]
*  you know, was a little fearful of that. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=830.98s)]
*  In the long run, I was glad I did it. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=832.62s)]
*  That's how I've gotten through my PTSD is by talking about it. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=835.02s)]
*  Sometimes it's difficult, sometimes it's not. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=839.7800000000001s)]
*  It's helped me a great deal talking about it. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=843.0999999999999s)]
*  You know, helps me sleep at night. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=846.0999999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of folks at home would like to know, after 10 years, would you consider, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=848.54s)]
*  in terms of their mental health, would you consider a lot of these patients to be better? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=855.9799999999999s)]
*  I do believe that they are better from the point of view of moving on with their lives [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=862.42s)]
*  and having become much more adaptable. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=869.66s)]
*  But I don't think they ever leave it behind. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=873.3s)]
*  It's a constant part of their life. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=875.98s)]
*  I think that that's true for any great event that occurs, but especially true for this event, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=878.5799999999999s)]
*  which was etched into their consciousness. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=884.66s)]
*  Dr. Love's interviews are now a documentary and also a book called We're Not Leaving, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=887.54s)]
*  the memorable quote from Officer Carol Palkner to that FBI agent who had urged her to run. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=893.5s)]
*  The profits will go to scholarships and job training for the responders and their families. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=899.58s)]
*  John Field was a demolition expert who helped move the wreckage. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=905.1800000000001s)]
*  These men and women to the left and right of me and behind me, they're the best of the [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=910.4200000000001s)]
*  best of what America offered 10 years ago. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=912.86s)]
*  We can't change history. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=915.9000000000001s)]
*  And through their eyes, they're telling America what they've seen, what they did, and what [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=918.3000000000001s)]
*  they're going through 10 years later, and that is priceless. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=922.58s)]
*  Now the Library of Congress is looking into adding the interviews to its permanent collection [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=926.5s)]
*  to be kept for all time so that generations can hear the unedited, unvarnished reality [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=931.46s)]
*  as experienced by the people who were there. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=937.98s)]
*  One thing I want to say, the real heroes out of this stuff are dead. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=941.14s)]
*  Thank you, absolutely. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=945.62s)]
*  They're not here. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=946.62s)]
*  Nobody here is a hero. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=947.7s)]
*  We just did what everybody else did. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=949.58s)]
*  The true heroes are people who went into those buildings and never made it out. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=952.9s)]
*  It all started in Manhattan nearly two months ago at a place that would be known forever [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=967.14s)]
*  as Ground Zero, an act of terrorism and mass murder that ignited a war that now has no [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=972.14s)]
*  end in sight. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=979.02s)]
*  We've learned about the people who died there, the murderers who killed there, the heroes [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=980.9s)]
*  who still work there. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=986.34s)]
*  Tonight for the first time, we take you under Ground Zero to a once vibrant underground [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=988.34s)]
*  city within a city that is now a 16-acre burial ground, a place where the effort to rebuild, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=993.38s)]
*  both physically and psychologically, faces extraordinary challenges. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1000.86s)]
*  Ten weeks and a day after the attack on America's Twin Towers, there is still smoke in the air [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1007.1s)]
*  at Ground Zero. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1012.38s)]
*  They can't put out the subterranean fires. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1014.0600000000001s)]
*  It will be several more months before all the debris here will be carted away, and then [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1017.14s)]
*  there will be an even more daunting and dangerous and time-consuming cleanup job, digging up [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1021.86s)]
*  and repairing what you can't see here, the tunnels and garages and underground mall beneath [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1027.38s)]
*  Ground Zero. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1033.78s)]
*  John Holden, Commissioner of New York's Department of Design and Construction, is the city's [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1035.58s)]
*  point man in the cleanup effort. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1040.1799999999998s)]
*  He says debris from the tall towers crashed through the roof of this building, World Trade [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1042.4199999999998s)]
*  Center Building 6, and through the basement's six stories underground. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1047.1799999999998s)]
*  Large chunks of that heavy facade broke off, presumably from the upper floors, 90 or higher, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1053.3s)]
*  and just crashed through the center of this building, crashing through the nine floors [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1063.5s)]
*  of this building, and you'll see when we go underground, crashing through many of the [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1066.94s)]
*  concrete slabs that create the parking structure. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1071.74s)]
*  The debris, some of the individual pieces weighing 30 tons, cannonballed through Building [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1074.74s)]
*  6, creating an open space that looks like an atrium. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1079.98s)]
*  It left much of the building unstable, above ground and below. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1084.46s)]
*  Be really careful here, a lot of these blocks are loose. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1089.98s)]
*  Down below there are cracks and fissures in the staircases and walls. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1093.9s)]
*  Here's a hell of a crack in this. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1098.54s)]
*  And there was worse to come. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1101.42s)]
*  It is still very dangerous down here, a war zone. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1103.42s)]
*  The deeper we descended, the darker and drearier and dustier it became. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1107.7s)]
*  You gotta get all those concrete blocks above your head, so please just kind of keep an [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1112.54s)]
*  eye, try to stay off underneath them, but only being held on by wires. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1115.74s)]
*  You could smell smoke, and when the wind shifts in certain pockets, there is the uniquely [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1119.64s)]
*  unmistakable smell of death. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1125.0s)]
*  There was devastation everywhere, so much damage to the superstructure that, quite frankly, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1127.98s)]
*  we were surprised to see anything still standing. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1133.0s)]
*  And these are the huge columns, the huge exterior columns that support the exterior of the building, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1136.76s)]
*  and you can see the force of the fire and the explosion has basically sheared off, and [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1141.48s)]
*  so that when you look at it from the outside, you see that northern facade is leaning against [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1146.52s)]
*  this building, and that's why it's leaning, because these have sheared off. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1150.1200000000001s)]
*  When you see a building standing intact, Ken, you don't think it's possible this kind of [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1152.92s)]
*  thing can happen. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1157.4s)]
*  No, no, we're seeing very unusual circumstances throughout this building. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1158.4s)]
*  We kept descending. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1162.3600000000001s)]
*  This is level B3, three floors beneath ground zero. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1164.1200000000001s)]
*  We walked into what used to be a garage for the federal government employees who worked [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1168.0800000000002s)]
*  in the building. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1171.5800000000002s)]
*  The daylight, you see, filters in from that giant crater at the bottom of what Holden [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1172.82s)]
*  calls the atrium. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1177.62s)]
*  I call it the atrium. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1179.1s)]
*  Obviously, it was not an atrium. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1180.6599999999999s)]
*  You can see cars hanging off here, cars down here. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1183.02s)]
*  This is an automobile hanging like this. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1188.9399999999998s)]
*  With its tires burnt off, obviously the rubber has been burnt off. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1192.32s)]
*  The fire here was so hot, obviously these cars are all burnt out, but you'll be able [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1196.02s)]
*  to see over here. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1200.1s)]
*  I believe it's over here. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1201.1s)]
*  I see the aluminum hubcap has just melted right off. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1202.1s)]
*  That's a puddle of aluminum from the fire. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1206.58s)]
*  This is what's left of the hubcap? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1209.1s)]
*  Yep. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1210.5s)]
*  There's a car right down there. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1211.5s)]
*  Careful. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1213.5s)]
*  There's a muffler, and there's a car down there. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1214.5s)]
*  This is really eerie, because you realize it's not only a graveyard for automobiles, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1220.1799999999998s)]
*  it's a graveyard for some people. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1224.3799999999999s)]
*  Thousands of people used to come to these underground tunnels every day, not just to [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1229.08s)]
*  work in the towers and park their cars, but also to visit a vast underground shopping [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1233.52s)]
*  mall. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1238.6799999999998s)]
*  Thousands of people came here to shop every day. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1239.6799999999998s)]
*  It was a city underneath the city. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1242.9199999999998s)]
*  A very, very vibrant place. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1245.9199999999998s)]
*  Shops were down here. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1249.3999999999999s)]
*  Shops, restaurants, 15 to 25,000 people per building between people who actually work [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1250.3999999999999s)]
*  there. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1256.1999999999998s)]
*  You have the one and the nine train going through the middle of the complex. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1257.82s)]
*  You've got the path trains. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1261.26s)]
*  This is a huge, this was a mini city. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1262.8600000000001s)]
*  Below ground. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1266.54s)]
*  All below ground. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1267.54s)]
*  We still had three stories to go to get down to the rail tunnels. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1268.54s)]
*  It was pitch black, disorienting, and it was slippery. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1273.3400000000001s)]
*  The floor was slick with oil and gas from the abandoned cars, and we were warned the [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1278.18s)]
*  floor could collapse at any minute. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1282.78s)]
*  You see these cracks right here? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1285.96s)]
*  Right along here, this is a cracked slab. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1288.3200000000002s)]
*  You can see it goes all the way. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1290.52s)]
*  In a normal world, this is not a place I would recommend taking anyone to walk. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1293.24s)]
*  Well, that's the reason we want to keep moving here, because this is unstable. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1300.0s)]
*  The path commuter rail line is six stories below ground zero. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1304.3600000000001s)]
*  Miraculously, perhaps, no one died in this station the day the towers came down. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1309.0400000000002s)]
*  The standard operating procedure for the Port Authority and the TA is when there's a fire [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1314.46s)]
*  to evacuate, so all these, both the path trains and the subways were evacuated when the buildings [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1319.26s)]
*  were on fire. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1324.78s)]
*  So when they did collapse, no one was injured. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1326.22s)]
*  We lost a lot of people, but we saved a lot more than we lost. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1329.3799999999999s)]
*  Thirty-five thousand commuters used to arrive in this station from New Jersey every day, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1333.06s)]
*  but everything stopped just five minutes after Tower One tumbled down six stories overhead. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1338.3999999999999s)]
*  Of all the things we've seen, we've seen some incredible things today. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1345.3999999999999s)]
*  Seeing this empty train stand out. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1349.72s)]
*  Pretty eerie. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1353.4399999999998s)]
*  It's pretty eerie. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1354.4399999999998s)]
*  And the sign that says, Next Stop Home, I mean, that's really kind of poignant. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1355.4399999999998s)]
*  Fortunately, there was nobody in the train. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1359.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1361.1999999999998s)]
*  And this got evacuated. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1362.1999999999998s)]
*  This was all evacuated. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1363.84s)]
*  No one was hurt down here. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1364.84s)]
*  But it may take two years before the trains will start rolling here again, and even longer [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1367.0s)]
*  before a nearby subway line will be fixed. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1372.22s)]
*  There are hundreds of miles of wires, pipes and cables to be replaced. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1375.42s)]
*  By the end of next year, Commissioner Holden hopes to have his area above and below ground [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1380.54s)]
*  zero cleared up. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1385.94s)]
*  Price tag? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1387.7s)]
*  Two and a half billion dollars. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1388.7s)]
*  Ken, estimated, how much debris have you already removed? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1390.54s)]
*  We've probably removed somewhere in the area of 400,000 tons. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1394.2s)]
*  The initial estimates that we worked out with FEMA, the Federal Emergency Agency, were somewhere [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1399.2s)]
*  in the area, and with the Port Authority, we're somewhere in the area of 1.2 million [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1404.22s)]
*  tons, so we're probably about a third of the way through. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1407.98s)]
*  That's 1.2 million tons. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1410.9399999999998s)]
*  Of steel and debris. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1413.06s)]
*  Most of that from the surface? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1415.34s)]
*  Almost all of that from the surface. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1417.28s)]
*  We're just beginning to get below grade. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1418.52s)]
*  And to those who say, I appreciate their spirit, but they must be kidding themselves, it just [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1420.82s)]
*  can't be done, you say what? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1425.5s)]
*  We'll get it done. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1427.76s)]
*  We took one on the chin, knocked us on our butt, but like on the Arcas, we'll pick ourselves [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1428.96s)]
*  up, we'll dust our clothes off, and we'll get back to doing what we do best. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1433.6799999999998s)]
*  But removing the debris that is underground is a logistical dilemma, an engineering nightmare. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1438.6799999999998s)]
*  When the World Trade Center complex was built 30 years ago, an enormous retaining wall, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1444.3799999999999s)]
*  called a slurry wall, was constructed below ground. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1449.64s)]
*  The wall is three feet wide and 60 to 70 feet deep. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1453.2800000000002s)]
*  It was designed to prevent water from the Hudson River, just blocks away, from flooding [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1457.5600000000002s)]
*  the six-story basements. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1462.5200000000002s)]
*  Here is your slurry wall. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1465.1200000000001s)]
*  This is probably an old tie-back. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1466.24s)]
*  The other side of this is the Hudson River? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1468.24s)]
*  Well the other side of this is mud, but the water table here is extremely high because [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1469.92s)]
*  we're so close to the river that special construction techniques were needed. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1476.8600000000001s)]
*  The massive underground containing structure is nicknamed the bathtub. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1482.5s)]
*  That's the difference, the bathtub in your house is designed to keep the water in. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1486.94s)]
*  This keeps it out so that they can build the parking structures underground here. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1490.3s)]
*  For 30 years now, the wall has been supported by the floors in the basement levels, floors [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1494.46s)]
*  that have now buckled. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1499.78s)]
*  Because of all the damage, Ken Holden's engineers will have to shore up the wall with more than [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1501.8600000000001s)]
*  a thousand cables to prevent it from collapsing. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1506.06s)]
*  You know we're drilling through the three-foot wall, drill 85 feet or so down to bedrock, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1509.58s)]
*  then we drill 35 feet into bedrock, then we take basically the same kind of cables that [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1515.78s)]
*  they use on bridges, grout it up, basically concrete it up, wait three days for it to [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1520.34s)]
*  cure and then they tension those cables and that sustains the wall. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1524.8999999999999s)]
*  Something fell? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1534.62s)]
*  Something fell. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1535.62s)]
*  Once the permanent... [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1537.1s)]
*  Are we alright here? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1538.1s)]
*  We're fine. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1539.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1540.1s)]
*  Commissioner Holden knows he can never let his guard down here and he has concerns about [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1541.1s)]

*  Is there some water seeping through or not much? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1554.78s)]
*  There is no more water seeping through the slurry wall now than there is in normal circumstances. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1557.54s)]
*  But it's a constant battle to keep it dry down here, to keep the floods out. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1563.48s)]
*  Even when the wall is intact, there are several inches of water in these tunnels. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1567.92s)]
*  But this water is not seeping in from the river, this comes from fireman's water. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1572.3600000000001s)]
*  Saving the wall is critical. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1577.76s)]
*  If the tunnels flood, the water could pour into train and subway lines and destabilize [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1580.16s)]

*  This was probably about two weeks ago where a father firefighter was walking around asking [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1606.6s)]
*  us to hold off on the road building operation. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1614.08s)]
*  Basically pointed to a road to his left, he said, you guys have already buried my best [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1616.6799999999998s)]

*  another road. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1626.76s)]
*  I saw it out of the corner of my eye, the father going, climbing up to the debris pile [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1627.76s)]
*  with a spade and picking up spadefuls of debris, looking for a son in that manner. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1633.32s)]
*  And then threw the spadefuls back and continued to climb and look for spadefuls. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1640.44s)]
*  It was probably, probably ranks as one of my more poignant moments. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1643.84s)]
*  It's been seven weeks and a day. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1649.08s)]
*  The firefighters and other rescue workers still search around the clock at ground zero, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1652.28s)]
*  looking for the bodies of the thousands of people who have died here. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1656.6000000000001s)]

*  In order for me to work here every day, I think I have to segue away from the sacred [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1669.8000000000002s)]
*  ground considerations and move towards a construction site. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1674.3200000000002s)]
*  You can't work here without being cognizant of the fact that there are people here, there's [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1679.72s)]
*  suffering here, there's dead bodies here, and there's a need to treat this ground in [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1684.92s)]
*  a manner different from you would, than you would in any other construction site. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1691.28s)]
*  Since the attack at ground zero, Ken Holden and his troops have been down in the rubble [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1695.32s)]
*  almost every day. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1699.84s)]
*  It hasn't been easy, but America is at war, and Commissioner Holden plans to win. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1701.56s)]
*  I think my attitude is probably the same attitude that most of the guys have down here working [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1708.0s)]
*  on a day-to-day basis, working on the pile. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1711.92s)]
*  Sixty years ago when the Nazis were bombing Great Britain and the British people were [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1715.04s)]
*  pulling out their family and their friends and their neighbors from the rubble, Winston [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1722.0800000000002s)]
*  Churchill said, we shall not fail, we shall not falter, we shall not weary, we shall not [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1727.96s)]
*  tire, just give us the tools and we'll finish the job. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1743.32s)]
*  This was the year that ground zero was supposed to be transformed into a soaring statement [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1747.24s)]
*  of American spirit. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1760.92s)]
*  The site of the 9-11 attack on New York was to be a world landmark, bigger than the World [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1762.44s)]
*  Trade Center before it. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1767.68s)]
*  Plans were announced for America's tallest tower, its most beautiful rail station, and [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1769.68s)]
*  one of its most solemn monuments. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1774.24s)]
*  So we wondered, why is ground zero still a hole in the ground? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1776.72s)]
*  We returned to lower Manhattan recently and found that eight and a half years later, much [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1781.5s)]
*  of ground zero is still marking time. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1786.6000000000001s)]
*  Each year on September 11th, the emotions return. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1794.4s)]
*  The sorrow for the 2,752 people murdered here, the sense of 300 million Americans united [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1803.68s)]
*  in one place, and the desire to fight back by filling the void in the heart of New York. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1811.68s)]
*  But this is ground zero today, much of it still a pit, where there are supposed to be [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1828.48s)]
*  five skyscrapers, a memorial, a museum, a theater, and a transit hub. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1833.8s)]
*  So when you look out on where this project is after eight years, how would you describe [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1840.2s)]
*  this? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1845.72s)]
*  I describe this as a national disgrace. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1848.44s)]
*  I am the most frustrated person in the world. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1852.52s)]
*  Larry Silverstein is a New York real estate tycoon who believed that he would rebuild [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1855.6399999999999s)]
*  ground zero. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1860.48s)]
*  It's hard to contemplate the amount of time that's gone by here, the tragic waste of time, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1862.44s)]
*  and what could have been instead of what is today. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1869.6799999999998s)]
*  Silverstein owns a 99-year lease on the property, which entitled him to rebuild the buildings [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1874.84s)]
*  But on the day that we visited, Silverstein had a hard time even getting past the guard. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1881.6s)]
*  The holdup at the gate is a symptom of how much the relationship has soured between Silverstein [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1889.72s)]
*  and the government agency that is supposed to be his partner. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1895.72s)]
*  Ground zero is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1899.72s)]
*  It's a behemoth of a bureaucracy that answers to the governors and legislatures of both states. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1903.6s)]
*  The port, as it's called, runs bridges, tunnels and airports. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1909.64s)]
*  The only skyscrapers it ever built were the Twin Towers 40 years ago. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1913.74s)]
*  Today the port is responsible for making ground zero ready for construction, but it's years [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1918.96s)]
*  behind schedule, billions over budget, and there's no end in sight. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1924.0800000000002s)]
*  You continue going at the rate we're going, these buildings might not be finished until [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1930.0s)]
*  the port's schedule, which is 2037. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1932.92s)]
*  I'm 78 years of age. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1935.72s)]
*  I want to see this thing done in my lifetime. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1937.76s)]
*  This is what you were supposed to see by now. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1940.0400000000002s)]
*  We built a model of the master plan that was announced seven years ago by architect Daniel [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1942.92s)]
*  Leibeskind, the winner of the competition to rebuild ground zero. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1948.24s)]
*  It's something for the public to enjoy and to reaffirm that feeling of unity in life. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1952.2s)]
*  Leibeskind wanted to put a very large tower at the north end of the site, right here. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1957.52s)]
*  Paul Goldberger wrote a book on the project. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1964.68s)]
*  He's the architecture critic for the New Yorker magazine. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1966.8799999999999s)]
*  He had gardens at the top and this spire going all the way up to 1776 feet. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1969.84s)]
*  There were going to be gardens here that formed what he called a vertical park. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1975.96s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1979.6s)]
*  And then a series of other office towers that would kind of spiral up to the climax of number [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1981.32s)]
*  one. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1987.04s)]
*  This is what Leibeskind's plan looked like in early 2003 when it was chosen. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1988.04s)]
*  What people in this country thought was going to be built here. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1992.54s)]
*  So did Leibeskind, I think, actually. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1995.5s)]
*  But it wasn't. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1998.18s)]
*  The trouble started with the tallest tower. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=1999.42s)]
*  Silverstein didn't think the design was sensible as commercial real estate, so he insisted [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2002.22s)]
*  on bringing in a new architect. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2006.74s)]
*  After a struggle of egos, the curtain was pulled to reveal a second tower design. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2009.1399999999999s)]
*  But this was the beginning of a pattern. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2015.04s)]
*  Lots of models, no buildings. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2017.82s)]
*  Instead of a construction site, Ground Zero became a stage for elaborate but meaningless [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2021.1s)]
*  groundbreakings and ribbon cuttings. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2026.1799999999998s)]
*  This show was more than five years ago when New York Governor George Pataki laid the cornerstone [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2031.26s)]
*  for the second version of the tower. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2037.26s)]
*  Today we take Adirondack granite, the bedrock of our state, and place it as the foundation, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2039.6599999999999s)]
*  the bedrock of this new symbol of American strength and confidence. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2046.1s)]
*  The granite, with its inscription honoring the fallen and the enduring spirit of freedom, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2051.18s)]
*  was to be rock-solid proof that the project was underway. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2056.38s)]
*  Today we build the Freedom Tower. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2060.2999999999997s)]
*  But the Freedom Tower wouldn't be built either. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2064.86s)]
*  Instead, it became a symbol of bureaucratic bungling. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2067.54s)]
*  It turned out that communications had broken down with the police department. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2071.12s)]
*  After construction had begun, the NYPD said the tower was vulnerable to truck bombs. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2075.72s)]
*  Construction stopped for a year, while a third version was designed and unveiled. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2082.4s)]
*  It had become, sadly, much, much more ordinary. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2088.68s)]
*  The NYPD required that it be elevated 200 feet above the street to protect it. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2093.78s)]
*  So it's standing on a pedestal. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2101.9s)]
*  Standing on, well, that's a nice way to put it, standing on a pedestal. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2104.0400000000004s)]
*  How would you put it? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2106.7200000000003s)]
*  I would put it, unfortunately, it's a building on top of a concrete bunker. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2107.7200000000003s)]
*  It was called by the governor the Freedom Tower, but I said at one point around then, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2111.48s)]
*  I wondered if it shouldn't be called the Fear Tower instead. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2116.32s)]
*  Actually, the Port Authority did change the name. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2119.6200000000003s)]
*  Freedom was dropped in favor of One World Trade Center. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2122.86s)]
*  Today construction is underway on that 20-story blast-proof pedestal. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2127.06s)]
*  But most of the rest of the Ground Zero project is still a question mark, including the plans [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2132.1800000000003s)]
*  for a spectacular $2 billion train station. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2137.56s)]
*  It was back in 2005 in another one of those impressive ceremonies [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2141.3s)]
*  that the Port Authority launched the station designed by star architect Santiago Calatrava. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2149.34s)]
*  The station was due to be finished last year, but the cost has now doubled to $4 billion [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2155.5s)]
*  and this is how much is done. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2162.46s)]
*  The Calatrava train station, as originally announced, is supposed to be standing here [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2165.78s)]
*  in front of us. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2169.5400000000004s)]
*  Then the Port Authority said, okay, 2011. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2170.98s)]
*  2011. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2173.6200000000003s)]
*  Is it going to be there in 2011, next year? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2174.6200000000003s)]
*  You can judge for yourself. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2177.02s)]
*  The excavation that was supposed to be done a long time ago, it's still going forward. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2178.44s)]
*  What's gone wrong? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2183.78s)]
*  Well, failure has many architects. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2184.78s)]
*  A hard-nosed businessman like Silverstein resisted building landmarks that didn't make [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2188.02s)]
*  sense to him commercially. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2192.82s)]
*  The Port Authority didn't have the staff or management to lead the development of the [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2194.94s)]
*  Grand Master Plan. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2198.86s)]
*  And because the Port is a state agency, the nation's most powerful mayor, Michael Bloomberg, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2200.9s)]
*  became a bystander. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2205.94s)]
*  Throw in egos, politics and incompetence and you have a project that is still in a [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2207.82s)]
*  ditch. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2212.6800000000003s)]
*  Saving Ground Zero has now fallen to Chris Ward. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2213.6800000000003s)]
*  Ward is the latest executive director of the Port Authority. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2218.0800000000004s)]
*  He was brought in a year and a half ago specifically to get Ground Zero off the ground. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2221.2000000000003s)]
*  For me this is a dream job. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2227.52s)]
*  This was the job that I always wanted. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2229.92s)]
*  This ate up three executive directors before you. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2231.8s)]
*  Now you're number four. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2234.82s)]
*  I'm number four. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2235.82s)]
*  Well, you know, fortune favors the daring. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2237.82s)]
*  Ward has a background building big projects and a degree from the Harvard Divinity School, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2240.42s)]
*  which can't hurt on something as bedeviling as this. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2246.42s)]
*  Ward set new deadlines and budgets and he's struggling to keep them. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2250.52s)]
*  Most everyone agrees he's doing better than his predecessors. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2254.7000000000003s)]
*  Ward told us that one reason the work has slipped is the sheer complexity of coordinating [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2258.56s)]
*  so many projects on one site. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2264.0s)]
*  The basement is 16 acres and seven stories deep. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2266.68s)]
*  Everything is interconnected. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2270.94s)]
*  A delay in one place can tie up the whole works. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2271.94s)]
*  This is like a game of pick-up sticks down here. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2276.18s)]
*  Every single part of this project touches another piece. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2279.74s)]
*  Ward sounds confident, but just try asking about the designs shown to the public. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2283.5s)]
*  Are these things going to be built? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2288.8999999999996s)]
*  Can you actually say that at this point? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2290.5s)]
*  What I can tell you is that downtown will come back. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2294.14s)]
*  We asked for an update on all the major buildings. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2298.16s)]
*  Number one World Trade Center. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2301.7999999999997s)]
*  It will be done at the end of 2013. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2302.7999999999997s)]
*  Two World Trade Center. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2305.64s)]
*  It's completion date uncertain at this time. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2306.64s)]
*  Three World Trade Center. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2308.72s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2309.72s)]
*  Don't know what's going to be built there yet. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2310.72s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2311.72s)]
*  Four World Trade Center. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2312.72s)]
*  Completion date in 2014. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2313.72s)]
*  Five World Trade Center. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2315.92s)]
*  Five World Trade Center is uncertain at this point. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2317.2799999999997s)]
*  Performing Arts Center. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2319.56s)]
*  Uncertain at this point. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2321.44s)]
*  Much of the uncertainty comes from the second disaster to hit Manhattan's financial district, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2322.74s)]
*  the Great Recession. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2328.4199999999996s)]
*  Financing and demand for office space have dried up. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2330.4199999999996s)]
*  Halt! [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2335.4199999999996s)]
*  Fair to say, the most sensitive piece of all is the memorial, envisioned in this animation. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2336.4199999999996s)]
*  Two waterfalls in the footprints of the original towers. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2342.58s)]
*  Demanded by the families promised by politicians, the memorial is the ports to build. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2346.74s)]
*  The president pledged to have it open by the 10th anniversary next year. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2353.12s)]
*  But we found his pledge depends on what the meaning of open is. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2356.76s)]
*  Are you talking about being completed? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2361.56s)]
*  No. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2362.56s)]
*  It's going to open and stay open? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2363.56s)]
*  That's what I want to be clear about. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2364.56s)]
*  First of all, we will still be surrounded by building construction. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2366.84s)]
*  So essentially it's going to open on the 10th anniversary and then it's going to close. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2370.4s)]
*  I wouldn't want to say close, but we can't have a free flowing open job site when there's [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2374.6800000000003s)]
*  going to be heavy materials, cranes, tractor trailer trucks still feeding this as a construction site. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2380.1800000000003s)]
*  On the 10-year anniversary of September 11th, $7 billion will have been spent but not one [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2387.1800000000003s)]
*  project will be finished. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2394.1800000000003s)]
*  Most of the buildings in the master plan are in doubt and at best, a decade after the attack, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2396.7400000000002s)]
*  ground zero will look something like this. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2402.5800000000004s)]
*  When the master plan was announced, there was a dream. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2406.66s)]
*  And I wonder, what killed the dream? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2410.2799999999997s)]
*  What killed the dream was that it was nibbled away at gradually by politics, by money, and [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2412.72s)]
*  the enormous complexity of bureaucracy and by the lack of a leader with real vision. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2421.2s)]
*  New York has had leaders of vision in the past. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2427.2s)]
*  Al Smith, the former governor, got the Empire State Building built in a year during the [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2430.0s)]
*  Great Depression. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2435.44s)]
*  But since 9-11, there have been three governors of New York, four executive directors of the [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2437.1s)]
*  Port Authority, and no one to see the project through. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2442.06s)]
*  The next chapter may be written by judges. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2446.34s)]
*  In January, an arbitration court threatened to create its own construction deadlines if [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2449.1s)]
*  Silverstein and the Port Authority failed to come up with a new plan by March. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2454.26s)]
*  You just want to work together to bring this to fruition, to bring this to a successful [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2459.34s)]
*  conclusion. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2463.66s)]
*  The fact of the matter is, you and the Port aren't talking to each other anymore. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2464.66s)]
*  Well, we're talking, but not in the fashion that one would expect or hope for. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2467.3999999999996s)]
*  Talking to your lawyers. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2473.52s)]
*  Unfortunately. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2475.56s)]
*  Not even 20 tons of Adirondack granite survived this project. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2477.6s)]
*  The cornerstone laid was ceremony that Independence Day, nearly six years ago, was unceremoniously [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2482.16s)]
*  pulled from the site and sent back to the manufacturer. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2489.2s)]
*  We found it where it rests now, 40 miles away along a highway on Long Island, a monument [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2493.08s)]
*  to the shifting plans and uncertain future of Ground Zero. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2500.2999999999997s)]
*  At times like these with the bombs in Boston, many of us can't help but be drawn back to [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2515.74s)]
*  the horrific events of September 11th, 2001. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2520.9s)]
*  About a year from now, at Ground Zero in New York City, one of the largest and most ambitious [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2525.38s)]
*  memorial museums in the world is scheduled to open its doors to tell the story of that [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2530.8s)]
*  day, the National September 11th Memorial Museum. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2536.34s)]
*  It'll actually be located below ground, seven stories down. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2540.6600000000003s)]
*  It's a project that's been plagued by delays, by funding battles, even a flood thanks to [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2545.42s)]
*  Hurricane Sandy. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2551.06s)]
*  But if you can believe it, those things were the easy part. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2552.78s)]
*  The bigger challenge, how do you convey the horror of 9-11 without making it unbearable, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2556.46s)]
*  memorialize a day most of us wish we could forget? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2562.82s)]
*  Tonight we'll take you down below for a first in-depth look at what our nation's 9-11 museum [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2567.02s)]
*  will be. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2573.1800000000003s)]
*  Ground Zero, above ground, is today a place of rebuilding and remembrance. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2575.82s)]
*  At its center is a serene memorial plaza with two giant cascading pools, twin voids set [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2581.86s)]
*  into the footprints where the towers of the World Trade Center once stood. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2589.26s)]
*  Each pool is surrounded by names, 2,983 of them, plus some who didn't even have a name. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2594.06s)]
*  It's quiet and powerful as people come, over seven million so far, to touch and feel, and [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2602.54s)]
*  in some cases mourn fathers, sisters, children. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2611.02s)]
*  But you won't find anything here about what actually happened on 9-11. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2616.2599999999998s)]
*  Nothing about the buildings, the planes, nothing about the terrorists. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2620.86s)]
*  All that will be the job of the museum and its director, Alice Greenwald. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2625.34s)]
*  We occupy literally the space below the memorial plaza. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2630.02s)]
*  So we're walking on the roof of the museum. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2633.86s)]
*  This is not Greenwald's first job on a project about a painful subject. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2637.86s)]
*  She came here from the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2642.14s)]
*  Just watch your step, Leslie. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2645.96s)]
*  It is a construction site. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2647.84s)]
*  But at this construction site, the issues go far beyond where to put the walls. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2649.66s)]
*  Virtually every decision here is fraught with meaning. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2654.18s)]
*  As you descend past two 50-ton beams recovered from the wreckage into a space... [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2657.5s)]
*  Welcome to Foundation Hall. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2663.38s)]
*  ...that takes your breath away. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2665.34s)]
*  It's haunting and a little chilling knowing you're in the belly of ground zero, in the [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2668.22s)]
*  place where so many innocent people lost their lives. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2673.42s)]
*  So here we are. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2677.38s)]
*  We're right where the buildings collapsed. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2678.86s)]
*  We're in it. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2681.94s)]
*  Most museums are buildings that house artifacts. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2682.94s)]
*  You're a museum in an artifact. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2686.74s)]
*  Where we are is almost sacred. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2688.3999999999996s)]
*  I think you become super conscious of where you're standing. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2690.8599999999997s)]
*  And that's a powerful thing. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2695.3799999999997s)]
*  It's a very powerful thing. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2697.1s)]
*  It's the authentic site of loss. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2699.14s)]
*  It is sacred in house, babe. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2700.14s)]
*  We spoke with four family members who are also members of the museum's board. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2702.06s)]
*  Paula Grant Berry's husband, David, worked in Tower 2, as did Monica Eiken's husband, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2707.2599999999998s)]
*  Michael. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2713.14s)]
*  Nula Katsomatidis' brother, John, was in Tower 1, and Tom Roger's daughter, Jean, was a flight [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2714.54s)]
*  attendant on American Airlines Flight 11. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2721.14s)]
*  The site radiates something for us all in a very special way. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2724.06s)]
*  That's where the final resting place of our lovelace is. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2727.74s)]
*  It has to be there. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2730.06s)]
*  It has to be there. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2731.06s)]
*  It has to be there, yes. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2732.06s)]
*  And you can feel it. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2733.06s)]
*  This is the remnant of the exterior structure that made up the Twin Towers. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2734.7s)]
*  One of Greenwall's first challenges in this hallowed space was deciding where the story [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2739.02s)]
*  of 9-11 should begin. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2743.98s)]
*  We begin with the voices of people from around the world. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2746.18s)]
*  I was driving to work. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2750.5s)]
*  Remembering where they were when they heard about the attack. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2752.26s)]
*  The idea is to acknowledge that most visitors will bring their own memories of 9-11, which [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2759.54s)]
*  was witnessed within hours by people all across the globe. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2764.78s)]
*  Greenwall says we are all survivors of 9-11, so it's fitting that visitors will descend [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2773.26s)]
*  to the main exhibits of the museum beside an enormous staircase, now encased in wood, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2778.5800000000004s)]
*  that served as an escape route. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2785.2200000000003s)]
*  On 9-11, hundreds of people ran to safety down this stair. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2787.1000000000004s)]
*  The so-called survivor staircase is one of several artifacts so big, the museum had to [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2792.2200000000003s)]
*  be built around them. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2798.1400000000003s)]
*  Like this fire engine lowered in through a hatch in the roof that will honor first responders, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2800.16s)]
*  441 of whom lost their lives. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2805.8799999999997s)]
*  And the famous last column, the final massive remnant of the towers to be removed from the [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2809.16s)]
*  site. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2815.2s)]
*  So there's no sound. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2816.2s)]
*  But we found that some of the most powerful things on display here, won't be physical [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2817.2s)]
*  artifacts at all. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2824.98s)]
*  Oh look, the second plane. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2826.52s)]
*  A large projection on the wall will show the morning of 9-11 as it played out in the air. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2828.68s)]
*  Flight 11 is hijacked. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2834.88s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2835.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, flight 77 leaves. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2836.88s)]
*  With the simultaneous flight paths of the four planes. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2838.96s)]
*  And now flight 93 takes off. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2843.24s)]
*  Oh. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2846.04s)]
*  Impact has already happened in New York. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2847.68s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2849.3199999999997s)]
*  And then flight 93 is hijacked, turns around. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2850.3199999999997s)]
*  Among the agonizing decisions for the museum, should they include the voicemail messages [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2853.2s)]
*  left by passengers aboard those planes and other victims of 9-11 for their loved ones. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2858.2s)]
*  One advisor told Greenwall to think of these recordings as a form of human remains. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2864.18s)]
*  What he said, and I've never forgotten it, is that sound can be a more emotional form [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2869.5s)]
*  of communication because you hear the timbre of the human voice. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2875.2999999999997s)]
*  Baby, you have to listen to me carefully. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2878.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm on a plane that's in hijack. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2881.8799999999997s)]
*  They plan to include a few recordings. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2883.7999999999997s)]
*  Seek permission from family members and use them only with a purpose. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2886.6s)]
*  This one from flight attendant Cece Lyles to her husband as a testament to the professionalism [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2891.56s)]
*  of the hijacked crews. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2896.8s)]
*  There's three guys in hijacked planes. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2898.32s)]
*  I'm trying to be calm. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2900.72s)]
*  She is so composed. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2902.36s)]
*  She's in flight attendant mode. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2904.7599999999998s)]
*  She's in flight attendant mode. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2905.7599999999998s)]
*  And at the very end of the call she says something like, I hope I see you again baby. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2907.48s)]
*  I hope to be able to see you again baby. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2913.08s)]
*  I love you. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2916.16s)]
*  Bye. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2917.16s)]
*  End of message. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2919.44s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2920.44s)]
*  And of course audio is just the beginning of the sensitive questions about what should [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2922.2s)]
*  be exhibited. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2926.4s)]
*  Let me ask you, what about some of the horrific shots, for example, of people jumping? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2927.6s)]
*  This is probably, as far as I'm concerned, the most sensitive question for this museum. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2935.56s)]
*  We went through a lot of debate internally about do we show that side of the story? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2941.76s)]
*  On the morning of September 11th, Joe Daniels came out of the subway to the gruesome sight [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2946.48s)]
*  of bodies falling from the North Tower. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2951.6400000000003s)]
*  Today he is president of the 9-11 Memorial and Museum. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2955.0400000000004s)]
*  You never want to have to see that. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2959.2400000000002s)]
*  Someone a hundred stories up a thousand feet in the air having to make that kind of choice. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2961.44s)]
*  On the same time there's a very strong feeling is that this was a part of the story. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2967.32s)]
*  That a group of people from this group, Al Qaeda, put innocent people in a position to have [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2971.6s)]
*  to do that. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2977.48s)]
*  When you think about what terrorism means, this really says it. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2978.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2983.84s)]
*  It's an impossible thing for a human being to do to another human being and yet it became [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2984.84s)]
*  possible on 9-11. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2988.56s)]
*  So for us not to acknowledge that would be to not be true to the story. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2990.12s)]
*  But how? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2995.74s)]
*  With video of people falling or photographs? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=2996.74s)]
*  And what about the feelings of family members? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3000.64s)]
*  Greenwald told us that she knows that some will never want to see an exhibit on this [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3003.2799999999997s)]
*  subject but many argued strongly that it had to be there. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3007.68s)]
*  I have to say that we were also, I don't want to say accosted, that's a little strong, but [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3011.8799999999997s)]
*  shaken by the lapels by family members who said you have to tell the story. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3019.0s)]
*  Don't whitewash this story. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3025.12s)]
*  Tell it like it was. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3026.7599999999998s)]
*  The world needs to know. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3028.0s)]
*  So we ultimately decided that we will include an exhibit but do it in a way in an alcove [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3030.28s)]
*  where people will be clearly warned if they don't want to see it or have their family [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3034.96s)]
*  see it, they can easily avoid it. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3038.2200000000003s)]
*  One exhibit they want everyone to see is what Greenwald calls the heart of this museum. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3040.44s)]
*  A space devoted to honoring the victims lives with photographs of each of them lining the [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3045.84s)]
*  walls. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3051.76s)]
*  Those giant walls out there go all the way up. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3052.76s)]
*  Every bit of space will be covered with faces? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3057.14s)]
*  Yes the impression will be that you are surrounded by nearly 3,000 faces. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3060.2999999999997s)]
*  These are the photographs that will cover those walls. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3065.42s)]
*  Look at those faces. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3068.1s)]
*  Look at all those faces. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3071.14s)]
*  They're ages 2 and a half to 85 from over 90 countries, every sector of the economy, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3073.2999999999997s)]
*  every possible ethnic group. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3080.82s)]
*  Viewers will be able to search these interactive tables and call up profiles of each person [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3082.82s)]
*  with photos and recorded remembrances by family members and friends, like this one by the [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3088.6600000000003s)]
*  father of Paul Aquaviva who died in Tower 1. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3094.78s)]
*  He never had a bad word literally to say about anybody. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3098.7400000000002s)]
*  He always looked at the positive. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3103.26s)]
*  You know I know to be honest with you he didn't get it from me because I'm very critical at [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3105.1800000000003s)]
*  times. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3110.46s)]
*  To me that was one of the most important things about Paul. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3111.46s)]
*  Some of them are funny, some of them are sweet and we're not telling you who they are, their [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3115.5s)]
*  loved ones are telling you who they are. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3119.7s)]
*  Visitors can also search by birthplace or by company. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3122.14s)]
*  If I call up Cantor. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3125.46s)]
*  Cantor Fitzgerald was the company that lost more employees than any other. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3127.38s)]
*  658 people who died on 9-11 at Cantor Fitzgerald. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA-vKBxGuCw&t=3132.3s)]
