# Interviews with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y)
*  Tonight, Scott Pelly in Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  The Ukrainian president faces a critical moment in his alliance with the United States. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=18.88s)]
*  In an interview this past Friday, Volodymyr Zelensky invited President Trump here to Ukraine [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=24.64s)]
*  to see how Russia's unprovoked invasion three years ago continues to threaten the peace [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  of the Western world. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Zelensky is navigating a sharp turnabout in Washington. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=38.96s)]
*  The United States had been leading NATO in arming Ukraine and isolating Russia, but since [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  taking office, President Trump has praised the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and criticized [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=49.56s)]
*  Zelensky. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=55.6s)]
*  This past Friday, a Trump official met Putin in Russia about the same time we sat down [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=56.96s)]
*  with Zelensky in his hometown. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  It had been a week since Russia killed nine children on a playground. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=65.6s)]
*  You seem to have a real hatred of Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=73.64s)]
*  Putin? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=80.4s)]
*  One hundred percent hatred, not even 99.9 percent, Zelensky told us. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=82.0s)]
*  Though this doesn't mean we shouldn't work to end the war as soon as possible and transition [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  to diplomacy, but how else can you see a person who came here and murdered our people, murdered [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  children? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=103.36s)]
*  We're inside a school bomb shelter right now. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=104.36s)]
*  The bomb shelter of a school. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=108.44s)]
*  The bomb shelter classrooms beneath the city of Krivorye were silent. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=112.52s)]
*  School 41 was mourning its students killed on April 4. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  Swing sets pierced by shrapnel stood where Zelensky laid his memorial to the nine children [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=123.8s)]
*  and ten others cut down by a Russian missile. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=131.0s)]
*  He asked us to look at their faces and told us that while the great powers endlessly debate [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=135.08s)]
*  war and peace, these children will never speak again. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=141.9s)]
*  Mr. President, what does an atrocity like this tell you about the progress of the war? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=148.36s)]
*  It means that we can't trust Russia. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=155.66000000000003s)]
*  We can't trust negotiations with Russia. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=159.0s)]
*  Russia strikes Ukrainian cities daily. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=164.76s)]
*  1700 attacks on schools. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=167.56s)]
*  600 children dead. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=170.48s)]
*  780 hospitals and clinics attacked. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=172.84s)]
*  13,000 civilians killed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  And up to 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers dead. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=179.48s)]
*  All for Vladimir Putin's vanity war to expand Russia to NATO's doorstep. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=184.28s)]
*  Our people have paid the highest price possible, Zelensky told us. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=190.88s)]
*  There is no higher price. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=201.44s)]
*  We have given all our money, all we have in terms of finances, but most important, we [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=203.22s)]
*  gave the lives of our people. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=209.56s)]
*  Those were the points Zelensky struggled to make in February as President Trump opened [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=212.94s)]
*  negotiations with Russia and initially excluded Ukraine. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=218.56s)]
*  Then Trump rewrote history, saying falsely that Ukraine had started the war and calling [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=224.28s)]
*  the democratically elected Zelensky a dictator without elections. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=231.56s)]
*  Zelensky better move faster. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=236.8s)]
*  He's not going to have a country left. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=238.44s)]
*  Got to move, got to move fast because that war is going in the wrong direction. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=240.08s)]
*  When President Trump called you a dictator and said that Ukraine started this war, what [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=245.48s)]
*  did you think? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  I believe, sadly, Russian narratives are prevailing in the U.S. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=254.68s)]
*  How is it possible to witness our losses and our suffering, to understand what the Russians [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=267.4s)]
*  are doing and to still believe that they are not the aggressors, that they did not start [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=273.04s)]
*  this war? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=279.04s)]
*  This speaks to the enormous influence of Russia's information policy on America, on U.S. politics [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=280.76s)]
*  and U.S. politicians. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=287.62s)]
*  You're not in a good position. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=289.52s)]
*  You don't have the cards right now. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=291.92s)]
*  And Zelensky told us he heard Russia's narrative from Trump officials in that disastrous Oval [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=294.36s)]
*  Office meeting in February. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=301.76s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=303.96s)]
*  Zelensky grew tense as President Trump said both sides were suffering, Ukraine's people [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=306.8s)]
*  and the Russian invasion force. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=313.32s)]
*  It's a shift in tone, a shift in reality, really, yes, a shift in reality. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=320.2s)]
*  I don't want to engage in the altered reality that is being presented to me. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=326.56s)]
*  First and foremost, we did not launch an attack to start the war. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=331.96s)]
*  It seems to me that the vice president is somehow justifying Putin's actions. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=336.76s)]
*  I tried to explain. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=343.32s)]
*  You can't look for something in the middle. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=345.06s)]
*  There is an aggressor and there is a victim. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=347.88s)]
*  The Russians are the aggressor and we are the victim. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=353.68s)]
*  Vice President Vance suggested that Putin could be trusted and it was Zelensky who was [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=358.2s)]
*  creating a false narrative. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=363.92s)]
*  Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=366.48s)]
*  I have been to… [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=369.76s)]
*  Come once. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=371.24s)]
*  I've actually watched and seen the stories and I know what happens is you bring people, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=372.24s)]
*  you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=378.04s)]
*  Would you invite President Trump to Ukraine? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=381.06s)]
*  With pleasure. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=383.86s)]
*  Please. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=385.9s)]
*  This, Zelensky apparently wanted President Trump to hear in English. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=386.9s)]
*  We want you to come and I think to come and to see. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=393.34000000000003s)]
*  You think you understand what's going on here. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=398.76s)]
*  Okay, we respect your position. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=400.78s)]
*  You understand. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=402.86s)]
*  But please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of formats of negotiations, come [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=404.06s)]
*  to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children, destroyed or dead. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=414.22s)]
*  Come. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=426.3s)]
*  Look and then let's move with the plan how to finish the war. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=427.78000000000003s)]
*  You will understand with whom you have a deal. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=433.7s)]
*  You will understand what Putin did and we will not prepare anything. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=437.82s)]
*  It will not be theater. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=443.53999999999996s)]
*  With preparing actors in the streets and etc. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  We don't do this. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=449.21999999999997s)]
*  We don't need it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=450.7s)]
*  You can go exactly where you want in any city which been under attacks. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=452.46s)]
*  What I said to them just to come and to understand. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=458.62s)]
*  With his invitation on its way, he switched to Ukrainian. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=463.5s)]
*  Does the United States have your back? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=468.16s)]
*  Even in this pause of mine, there is a problem. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=471.14s)]
*  Because I want to answer truthfully and quickly that the United States is our strategic strong [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=489.38s)]
*  partner. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=494.7s)]
*  But the pause is doubt. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=498.3s)]
*  I don't doubt that the people of America are with us. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=502.02s)]
*  But in a long war, many details are forgotten. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=505.62s)]
*  In Europe, everyone fears that the United States may drift away from Europe. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=512.06s)]
*  What can you do without the United States? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=518.34s)]
*  I think without the United States, we will suffer great losses, human and territorial. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=526.78s)]
*  So I wouldn't like to consider that. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=533.34s)]
*  But this is our destiny, our land, our life. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=536.66s)]
*  One way or another, we will end this war. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=541.14s)]
*  The U.S. has donated about $175 billion in aid. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=546.1s)]
*  Roughly $100 billion of that was military, most of which was spent in the U.S. on manufacturing [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=551.3000000000001s)]
*  American weapons. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=559.22s)]
*  What would you say that the American people have gotten for that money? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=561.14s)]
*  We have always believed that this is our shared struggle, that Ukraine is defending our shared [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=567.7s)]
*  values, that we are defending Europe as a whole. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=574.34s)]
*  I can only thank the people of the United States of America for their support, their [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=580.46s)]
*  strong support. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=584.86s)]
*  But the people dying right now, with all due respect to the U.S. and Europe, the ones dying [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=587.06s)]
*  right now are Ukrainians. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=593.78s)]
*  This is why I say that by giving us weapons, other countries are protecting their own people. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=596.54s)]
*  But in the Trump administration, U.S. aid has all but stopped. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=604.18s)]
*  Last month, the White House announced partial ceasefires, but they haven't happened. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=609.02s)]
*  And now Trump says he is losing patience with Putin. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=614.14s)]
*  Putin can't be trusted. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=620.42s)]
*  I told that to President Trump many times. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=621.6999999999999s)]
*  So when you ask why the ceasefire isn't working, this is why. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=628.06s)]

*  What does just peace look like to you? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=664.1s)]
*  To not lose our sovereignty or our independence, we, no matter what, will take back what is [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=670.58s)]

*  The Russians took it from us, the temporarily occupied territories. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=680.22s)]
*  We will not recognize, as Russia, those territories that the Russians temporarily occupy. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=685.26s)]
*  We will bring them back. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=691.58s)]
*  When or how, I cannot say. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=693.62s)]
*  But what we can't bring back are the human lives. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=696.84s)]
*  There's only one thing that can be done, justice. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=700.98s)]
*  We cannot let go the issue of justice. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=706.18s)]
*  Those who killed must pay for the murders. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=710.66s)]
*  Zelensky told us any true ceasefire must include a guarantee of Ukrainian security. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=715.66s)]

*  U.S. officials tell us that over nearly 600 days, almost half a million troops have been [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=851.7s)]
*  killed or wounded, both sides altogether. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=858.98s)]
*  Part of the cost so far of Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=863.86s)]
*  When we spoke to Zelensky on Thursday, he told us that his people are dying every day [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=869.7s)]
*  to prevent World War III. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=876.26s)]
*  We're defending the values of the whole world, Zelensky said. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=878.82s)]
*  And these are Ukrainian people who are paying the highest price. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=886.7s)]
*  We are truly fighting for our freedom. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=893.12s)]
*  We are dying. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=895.62s)]
*  We're not fiction. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=897.62s)]
*  We're not a book. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=899.02s)]
*  We're fighting for real with a nuclear state that threatens to destroy the world. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=903.5s)]
*  The United States has contributed about $70 billion to your war effort. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=909.78s)]
*  And I wonder if you expect that level of support to continue. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=916.38s)]
*  The United States of America is supporting Ukraine financially, and I'm grateful for [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=924.58s)]
*  this. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=929.46s)]
*  I just think they're not supporting only Ukraine alone. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=930.46s)]
*  If Ukraine falls, Putin will surely go further. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=934.5s)]
*  What will the United States of America do when Putin reaches the Baltic states, when [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=938.5400000000001s)]

*  Just think about it. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=964.76s)]
*  If the Russians reach Poland, what's next? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=965.9399999999999s)]
*  A third world war? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=968.9799999999999s)]

*  Another $70 billion? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=972.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't have an answer. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=977.14s)]
*  The whole world has to decide whether we want to stop Putin or whether we want to start [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=978.74s)]
*  the beginning of a world war. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=983.58s)]
*  We can't change Putin. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=987.18s)]
*  Russian society has lost the respect of the world. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=989.38s)]
*  They elected him and re-elected him and raised a second Hitler. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=992.66s)]
*  They did this. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=998.32s)]
*  We cannot go back in time. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=999.32s)]
*  But we can stop it here. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1002.1s)]
*  Ukraine stopped the Russian advance but at a terrible cost. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1006.38s)]
*  Ruined cities, millions of refugees, untold thousands of dead. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1011.02s)]
*  All for Vladimir Putin's nation-building vanity. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1017.66s)]
*  Today the war is fought on a 700-mile front. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1022.5s)]
*  The red area is the 20% of Ukraine still occupied by Russia. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1026.26s)]
*  This is where Western donated tanks were supposed to punch through, cutting the Russian [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1031.46s)]
*  force in half. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1036.9s)]
*  But trenches, minefields and artillery stopped the armored advance. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1038.74s)]
*  Now, it's an artillery duel, with each side firing about 40,000 shells a day. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1043.46s)]
*  Ukrainian infantry is advancing bloody yards at a time. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1052.18s)]
*  It's World War I with drones. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1057.86s)]
*  How would you describe the fighting at the front? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1062.1399999999999s)]
*  It's a difficult question. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1071.06s)]
*  I'll be completely honest with you. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1072.06s)]
*  We have the initiative, this is a plus. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1074.66s)]
*  We stopped the Russian offensive and we moved into a counter-offensive. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1080.12s)]
*  But despite that, it's not very fast. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1085.1s)]
*  It is important that we are moving forward every day and liberating territory. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1087.7s)]
*  You have about six weeks of good weather left and I wonder after that point will the front [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1093.5800000000002s)]

*  We need to liberate our territory as much as possible and move forward. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1103.66s)]
*  Even if it's less than half a mile or a hundred yards, we must do it. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1108.46s)]
*  We can't lose time. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1113.64s)]
*  Forget about the weather and the like. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1116.02s)]
*  In places that we can't get through in an armored vehicle, let's fly. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1118.18s)]
*  If we can't fly, let's send drones. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1123.34s)]
*  We mustn't give Putin a break. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1128.46s)]
*  If the front is stationary, Ukrainian drones have vaulted into Russia itself, hitting the [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1131.9s)]
*  Kremlin, warplanes and Moscow high-rises. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1138.42s)]
*  Officially, Ukraine does not acknowledge these attacks. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1142.34s)]
*  The drone strikes in Russia are being done on your orders? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1146.06s)]

*  We decided to try the question another way. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1161.62s)]
*  What message is being sent with these drone strikes in Russia? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1165.1s)]
*  You do know that we use our partner's weapons on the territory of Ukraine only, and this [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1171.1s)]
*  is true. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1177.98s)]

*  But Russia needs to know that wherever it is, whichever place they use for launching [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1186.02s)]
*  missiles to strike Ukraine, Ukraine has every moral right to send a response to those places. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1191.62s)]
*  We are responding to them, saying, your sky is not as well protected as you think. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1199.3799999999999s)]
*  Last winter it was Ukrainian skies that were filled with missiles in a Russian bombardment [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1208.3799999999999s)]

*  With winter approaching again, Zelenskyy had this warning. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1219.5s)]
*  They must know, if you cut off our power, deprive us of electricity, deprive us of water, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1224.58s)]

*  The red marks where Ukraine stopped Russia's advance last year. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1247.1s)]

*  Mr. President, in traveling around Ukraine for the last year and a half, we spoke to [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1257.48s)]
*  people in bombed out schools in Chernihiv. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1263.76s)]
*  We've seen destroyed apartment blocks in Borodoyanka, a bombed hospital in Izium, civilians in [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1268.76s)]
*  a mass grave in Buche. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1276.6799999999998s)]
*  These are not military targets. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1279.72s)]
*  What is Vladimir Putin trying to do? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1282.88s)]
*  To break us. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1289.0s)]
*  And by choosing civilian targets, Putin wanted to achieve exactly this. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1293.2800000000002s)]
*  To break us. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1298.8200000000002s)]
*  This person who has made his way with such bloody actions, with everything he has said, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1300.48s)]
*  cannot be trusted. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1307.64s)]
*  There is no trust in such a person because he has not been a human being for a long time. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1309.54s)]
*  The Russians have suffered grievous losses without resorting to nuclear weapons. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1316.58s)]
*  And I wonder if you believe that the threat of nuclear war is now behind us. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1324.7s)]
*  I think he's going to continue threatening. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1330.98s)]
*  He's waiting for the United States to become less stable. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1336.02s)]
*  He thinks that's going to happen during the U.S. election. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1340.3s)]
*  He'll be looking for instability in Europe and the United States of America. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1345.58s)]
*  He will use the risk of using nuclear weapons to fuel that instability. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1351.02s)]
*  He will keep on threatening. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1356.9s)]
*  That U.S. election he mentioned worries him. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1360.02s)]
*  His negotiations with President Biden have been contentious at times, but Zelensky tends [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1362.98s)]
*  to get what he asks for, even if, in Zelensky's opinion, it's generally six months too late. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1368.78s)]
*  This week, Zelensky will press Mr. Biden for missiles with longer range. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1376.24s)]
*  Congress is debating another $24 billion package. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1381.78s)]
*  And if Ukraine had enough of these modern systems, we would have already restored the [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1390.0s)]
*  territorial integrity of Ukraine. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1394.6000000000001s)]
*  We would have already done that. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1397.24s)]
*  These systems exist. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1399.66s)]
*  Are you safe here? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1402.0s)]
*  We first met Zelensky not long after the invasion, when his office was a blacked out bunker. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1404.58s)]
*  Now a year and a half later, we noticed a difference. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1411.92s)]
*  As we were setting up the interview, the former actor used his talent to mask the strain. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1416.14s)]
*  He smiled at a compliment to his wife. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1423.2s)]
*  And then instantly he seemed pulled beneath a depth no one can know. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1427.18s)]
*  We don't know what he was thinking. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1433.7s)]
*  It looked like empathy for the lost and for those who might be saved. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1435.9s)]
*  Our time with Zelensky began in silence, a remembrance of the fallen, during a ceremony [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1447.14s)]
*  to award medals of valor. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1454.0600000000002s)]
*  Ukrainian officials tell us Ukraine and Russia have lost their professional armies. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1458.6200000000001s)]
*  Now the forces are made up of volunteers, draftees, and, in Russia's case, prison inmates. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1464.7800000000002s)]
*  Zelensky counts his dead in casualty reports each morning. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1472.54s)]
*  You are the president, but it must be humbling to meet those men. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1476.6200000000001s)]
*  I wonder what they mean to you. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1481.42s)]
*  First of all, it's a great honor for me. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1488.42s)]
*  I look into their eyes and it makes me proud that we have such strong people, because this [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1490.6200000000001s)]
*  is a big risk, a big risk. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1496.14s)]
*  You can definitely lose your life for the sake of saving other lives. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1499.36s)]
*  And when I say other lives, I don't speak in general. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1504.06s)]
*  I mean my own life, the lives of my children. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1506.9599999999998s)]
*  And I understand completely what risks are involved. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1510.8s)]
*  That empathy for life has Volodymyr Zelensky reaching out again to the United Nations and [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1516.08s)]
*  the United States, hoping to convince the Allies that the world can be safe only when [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1523.8s)]
*  Ukraine is whole. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1530.92s)]
*  Can you give up any part of Ukraine for peace? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1533.4s)]
*  No. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1538.4s)]
*  No. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1539.4s)]
*  This is our territory. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1540.4s)]
*  You must have it all, including Crimea. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1542.88s)]
*  Today you and I, you said it to me, we are all here. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1545.88s)]
*  You said it to me, you saw me awarding people medals. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1553.8s)]
*  Today is a day like that. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1557.2s)]
*  A week ago I gave awards to parents of soldiers who have been killed. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1559.32s)]
*  There were 24 families of the dead. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1563.88s)]
*  There was a woman, she was with three children. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1566.78s)]
*  There were parents, very old, they could barely walk and they had had only one son. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1569.88s)]
*  One of the women was pregnant. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1576.6000000000001s)]
*  She arrived holding a baby in her arms and she was pregnant. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1578.42s)]
*  And that baby will never see. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1582.72s)]
*  What should I tell them? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1585.72s)]
*  That all of them died so that we could say, it's okay, Russia, you can take it all. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1587.44s)]
*  It's a difficult job. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1597.52s)]
*  You understand me, right? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1599.1200000000001s)]
*  Giving awards to people whose faces show their whole world has collapsed and all I [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1601.32s)]
*  can give them, all I can give them, is victory. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1607.68s)]
*  On February 24th, with the Russian invasion coming at him from three sides, Ukrainian [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1612.72s)]
*  President Volodymyr Zelensky reached for his most powerful weapon, his phone. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1627.1200000000001s)]
*  The moment Zelensky told his people he refused to flee, Ukraine refused to fall. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1632.9s)]
*  Comedians don't become legends often, but over these nearly seven weeks, this 44-year-old [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1639.9s)]
*  former comedian inspired his country to stand up to the overwhelming force of Russia. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1645.94s)]
*  Last Wednesday, we were admitted to Zelensky's fortified war rooms to meet the man who stands [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1652.94s)]
*  between the Russian army and the free world. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1659.38s)]
*  We met President Zelensky in the blacked out hallways of his command center in Ukraine's [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1666.38s)]

*  It is a fortress, crowded with troops, machine guns, mines, explosives and a great deal more. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1674.0200000000002s)]
*  Are you safe here? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1681.0200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'm fine, he told us. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1682.8200000000002s)]
*  I feel pretty calm about it. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1685.88s)]
*  Our guards are worried because there could be an air strike, but when we get the air [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1688.1200000000001s)]

*  Mr. President, what has it been like working under these conditions? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1696.42s)]
*  We found a way how to work. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1703.42s)]
*  We don't have another way. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1705.5s)]
*  You found a way how to work, you don't have any other way? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1707.3s)]

*  You can't switch the lights on because a bomb could just fly in during an air strike. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1716.3s)]
*  You have troops sleeping. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1722.94s)]
*  The president and his staff have lived here for 46 days now. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1724.66s)]
*  The Russian invasion plan expected Kiev to fall in three days, but that relied on one [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1730.38s)]
*  assumption that Zelensky would run. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1737.46s)]
*  When everyone is telling you, you need to go, you need to think. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1743.46s)]
*  Before I do something, I analyze the situation. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1748.5800000000002s)]
*  I've always done it calmly, without any chaos. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1751.4199999999998s)]
*  I might not be the strongest warrior, but I'm not willing to betray anyone. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1755.02s)]
*  What did you tell your wife and children about your decision? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1761.18s)]
*  I told them this is my choice and I can't do it any other way. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1766.46s)]
*  I'm the president of my country, I'm the president of our people, and even if I wasn't president, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1772.74s)]
*  I would have stayed here. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1779.42s)]
*  My family understood, not only understood, but fully supported my decision. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1782.0600000000002s)]
*  Fully. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1788.5s)]
*  It was the decision that saved Ukraine from immediate collapse. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1790.0200000000002s)]

*  You had made a decision to give your life for your country, if it came to that. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1813.06s)]
*  I don't want to make myself out to be a hero, he said. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1821.58s)]
*  I love my family, I want to live many more years. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1825.22s)]

*  For a man with 44 million lives in his hands, we found Zelensky buoyant, gracious, humble, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1839.18s)]
*  and brutally honest. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1847.3400000000001s)]
*  The day before our visit, an angrier Zelensky scolded the UN Security Council. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1851.8600000000001s)]
*  There's the security, he asked. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1858.18s)]
*  In speaking to NATO, you called them weak. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1863.14s)]
*  In speaking to the UN Security Council, you said if you can't help, you shouldn't exist. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1866.26s)]
*  Not very diplomatic of you. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1873.2s)]
*  I wonder why you feel the need to speak so bluntly. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1875.1000000000001s)]
*  When you're working at diplomacy, there are no results. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1883.26s)]
*  All of this is very bureaucratic. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1887.5s)]
*  That's why the way I am talking to them is absolutely justifiable. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1890.26s)]
*  I don't have any more lives to give. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1896.14s)]

*  I'm no longer interested in their diplomacy that leads to the destruction of my country. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1901.18s)]
*  A lot of countries have changed their mind about Ukraine and about our people, but I [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1908.06s)]
*  think we've paid too high a price for that. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1913.86s)]
*  What must the world understand? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1917.54s)]
*  We are defending the ability of a person to live in the modern world. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1922.14s)]
*  We are defending the right to live. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1928.38s)]
*  I never thought this right was so costly. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1931.9s)]
*  These are human values, so that Russia doesn't choose what we should do and how I'm exercising [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1935.5s)]
*  my rights. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1942.28s)]
*  This right was given to me by God and my parents. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1944.14s)]
*  God was hard to find on our visit to Kiev's northern suburbs, which Russia occupied for [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1950.18s)]
*  weeks. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1957.5400000000002s)]
*  Much of what we found will be difficult to watch. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1958.94s)]
*  Behind St. Andrew's Church, there is a sandy trench, not quite full, of civilian residents [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1962.9s)]
*  of the town of Buche. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1969.7800000000002s)]
*  Ukraine stopped the Russians here, 45 minutes from the center of the capital city. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1973.18s)]
*  The Russian retreat was so hasty, it seems there was no time to cover up the war crimes. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1979.02s)]
*  President Zelensky visited Buche two days before our interview. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1986.8200000000002s)]
*  What did you see in Buche? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1991.78s)]
*  Death. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1994.26s)]
*  Just death. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=1995.98s)]
*  Last Monday was the first time Zelensky saw with his own eyes what Russia has done in [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2001.62s)]
*  what Vladimir Putin calls the liberation of Ukraine. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2007.78s)]
*  The day after our interview, we found civilian neighborhoods in Buche, blocks and blocks, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2014.5s)]
*  shelled and blasted with no purpose but terror. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2022.3s)]
*  Bodies and parts of bodies lay in the streets, left out like trash, Zelensky told us. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2027.74s)]
*  No one knows how many victims are still in their homes, yet to be found. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2035.66s)]
*  There's a photograph, Mr. President, of you in Buche with an expression on your face that [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2042.34s)]
*  you have not allowed your people to see during this war. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2047.78s)]
*  And I wonder what we're seeing there. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2051.74s)]
*  Is that heartbreak? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2053.9399999999996s)]
*  Is it anger? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2055.74s)]
*  It's anger. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2058.7799999999997s)]
*  It's anger. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2061.5s)]
*  Because we don't understand, the Russians, you can't really understand this world, that [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2066.8999999999996s)]
*  there are people on this planet who give these orders and people who carry them out. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2072.8599999999997s)]
*  In Buche, neighborhood relief for the hungry and the homeless looked like World War II [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2079.98s)]
*  in color. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2088.1800000000003s)]
*  Valery Matvienko was so angry about the senseless Russian bullet wound in his leg, we can't [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2089.6200000000003s)]
*  repeat what he told us in English. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2097.1800000000003s)]
*  Some of the Russians were normal, some of them were totally crazy. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2101.82s)]
*  You could walk and they would shoot sometimes up in the air, sometimes at your legs, so [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2106.42s)]
*  you'd have to jump in front of them. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2111.46s)]
*  Cars were run over by Russian tanks. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2114.14s)]
*  Very brutal, not human. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2117.98s)]
*  We met Tatiana Dimitriyevna, who compressed the occupation into a single word. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2122.26s)]
*  Horror. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2131.42s)]
*  Horror, she said. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2133.9s)]
*  Gunfire was nonstop day and night. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2136.46s)]
*  Thanks to God, it all passed and we survived. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2139.0600000000004s)]
*  It's simply a miracle. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2142.1000000000004s)]
*  I had two grandchildren with me in the basement. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2144.0600000000004s)]
*  I never thought I would live to see this horror. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2147.5800000000004s)]
*  Mr. Zelensky told us that he couldn't believe that human beings could do something like [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2152.98s)]
*  this. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2159.46s)]
*  We never believed it either. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2161.1s)]
*  We are simply in shock, all of us. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2163.18s)]
*  What evidence is there of war crimes across Ukraine? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2166.46s)]
*  The Ukrainian security service has intercepted communications, he told us. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2171.18s)]
*  There are Russian soldiers talking with their parents about what they stole and who they [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2178.62s)]
*  abducted. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2183.58s)]
*  There are recordings of Russian prisoners of war who admitted to killing people. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2184.86s)]
*  There are pilots in prison who had maps with civilian targets to bomb. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2191.1400000000003s)]
*  There are also investigations being done based on the remains of the dead. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2197.9s)]
*  Should Vladimir Putin be prosecuted for war crimes? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2202.98s)]
*  Look, I think everyone who made a decision, who issued an order, who fulfilled an order, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2206.6200000000003s)]
*  everyone who is relevant to this, I believe they are all guilty. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2214.54s)]
*  Do you hold Putin responsible? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2220.98s)]
*  I do believe he's one of them. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2224.7799999999997s)]
*  That's what I believe. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2227.34s)]
*  The slaughter of civilians could have been stopped, Zelensky told us. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2230.7s)]
*  He's deeply grateful for the weapons NATO and the U.S. are sending around the clock, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2235.66s)]
*  But he's bitterly disappointed the allies refuse to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2240.94s)]
*  President Biden has called that an invitation to World War III. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2247.9s)]
*  But in Zelensky's view, it's the kind of inaction the world has suffered before. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2252.5s)]
*  Mr. President, in a speech to NATO, you said, quote, all the people who die will die because [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2259.9s)]
*  of you, because of your weakness. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2267.9s)]
*  Are you saying that the West bears some responsibility for these atrocities? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2272.42s)]
*  He told us, I remember, all of us remember, books about the Second World War and about [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2279.14s)]
*  the devil in uniform, Adolf Hitler. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2285.2200000000003s)]
*  Are those countries who did not participate in the war responsible? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2289.62s)]
*  The countries who let German forces march throughout Europe. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2294.46s)]
*  Does the world carry responsibility for the genocide? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2298.42s)]
*  Yes, yes it does. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2302.14s)]
*  When you have the ability to close the sky. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2304.9s)]
*  Yes, it's scary that a world war could start. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2307.98s)]
*  It's scary, I understand that. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2313.2200000000003s)]
*  And I cannot put pressure on these people because everyone is afraid of war. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2315.54s)]
*  But whether the world is responsible for this, I believe so. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2321.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes, I believe so. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2326.2999999999997s)]
*  Stand in front of the mirror every day and ask yourself, were you able to do something [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2329.3399999999997s)]
*  or were you unable to do something? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2335.1s)]
*  You will find the answer in the mirror to this question and to another question. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2338.58s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2344.74s)]
*  That's what I believe. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2346.8199999999997s)]
*  Perhaps Zelensky reaches for World War II because of his homeland's history of catastrophe. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2348.9s)]
*  And because he's Ukraine's first Jewish president. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2355.1800000000003s)]
*  Zelensky is 44 years old, holds a law degree. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2358.98s)]
*  He's married with a son and a daughter. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2362.94s)]
*  His family is safe somewhere in Ukraine. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2365.42s)]
*  In this war, Zelensky is the leading man in a tragedy. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2368.98s)]
*  But he's worked his entire career to make people laugh. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2374.5s)]
*  He was Ukraine's favorite comedian, whose sitcom was popular in Russia too. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2378.06s)]
*  In his show called Servant of the People, he played a high school history teacher whose [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2385.7s)]
*  anger at corruption in Ukraine explodes into a profane rant. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2391.86s)]
*  A student posts the tirade and the teacher is elected president. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2399.74s)]
*  In 2019, Zelensky turned parody into power. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2405.46s)]
*  He ran on an anti-corruption platform and won 73% of the vote. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2410.36s)]
*  He was 41 years old. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2416.5s)]
*  He brought longtime friend and business partner Andrei Yermak in as chief of staff. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2419.06s)]
*  He's smart, he's strong, he's brave, and he's a person who is self-made. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2425.14s)]
*  Zelensky is not just the leader of our heroic nation. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2433.66s)]
*  I think he is the leader of the free world. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2438.54s)]
*  Why do you say President Zelensky is the leader of the free world now? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2441.74s)]
*  Because Ukraine defend not just Ukraine. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2446.94s)]
*  We defend all democracy. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2450.94s)]
*  Zelensky has been defending Ukraine since his inauguration day. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2454.1s)]
*  That green t-shirt which caught the eye of the world was no surprise to Ukrainians. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2458.74s)]
*  He keeps fatigues in his office because he often visited the battlefront near the Russian [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2464.5s)]
*  border where Ukraine has been in a shooting war with Russia since 2014. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2470.2999999999997s)]
*  That was when Putin invaded part of Ukraine called the Donbas and seized Ukraine's Crimea [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2476.94s)]
*  Peninsula. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2483.5s)]
*  In 2014, before Zelensky was elected, a Russian anti-aircraft battery in Ukraine shot down [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2484.9s)]
*  an airliner killing 298 civilians. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2492.78s)]
*  In our interview, Zelensky told us he's been trying to warn the world that Putin will not [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2499.42s)]
*  stop at Ukraine. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2506.14s)]
*  Mr. President, it appears that the free world has calculated that the suffering of your [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2507.94s)]
*  people is not worth even the risk of a nuclear exchange. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2512.78s)]
*  I think so. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2519.5800000000004s)]
*  That's how it is. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2520.5800000000004s)]
*  Some are using that politically as an excuse by saying we can't defend Ukraine because [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2523.3s)]
*  there could be a nuclear war. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2528.98s)]
*  I think that today no one in this world can predict what Russia will do. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2531.5800000000004s)]
*  If they invade further into our territory, they will definitely move closer and closer [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2537.44s)]
*  to Europe. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2542.42s)]
*  They will only become stronger and less predictable. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2543.9s)]
*  President Biden says he is outraged by Buccia. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2548.02s)]
*  NATO leaders say they are outraged by Buccia. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2552.1s)]
*  So what should they do now? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2556.1s)]
*  Weapons number one. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2561.46s)]
*  They need to be very serious about it. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2563.0s)]
*  They definitely understand what I'm talking about right now. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2565.32s)]
*  They have to supply weapons to Ukraine as if they were defending themselves and their [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2569.58s)]
*  own people. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2574.74s)]
*  They need to understand this. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2576.34s)]
*  If they don't speed up, it will be very hard for us to hold on against this pressure. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2579.02s)]
*  The second factor is sanctions. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2585.42s)]
*  Because we've found some things in sanctions that are easy for financial experts to circumvent. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2587.7999999999997s)]
*  Russia has been circumventing them. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2593.98s)]
*  And this is absolutely true. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2596.2s)]
*  The Western world knows it. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2597.96s)]
*  This shouldn't be allowed. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2600.32s)]
*  This is not a movie. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2602.8s)]
*  This is real life. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2605.16s)]
*  Stop fearing the Russian Federation. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2607.4s)]
*  We've shown we are not afraid. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2610.76s)]
*  When we come back, in the wake of the Buccia atrocities, President Zelensky tells the United [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2614.58s)]
*  States what he must have to survive. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2620.08s)]
*  Friday, a Russian missile strike hit a crowd of refugees striving to escape eastern Ukraine [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2627.92s)]
*  by train. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2638.0s)]
*  At least 50 were killed, five children. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2639.48s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky calls it a war crime. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2643.44s)]
*  Tonight, Zelensky is fighting a powerful Russian assault on Ukraine's east and south. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2647.92s)]
*  Russia has not seized its strategic objectives, so instead, it's shelling defiant cities [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2653.56s)]
*  to ruin. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2659.92s)]
*  The one exception, at least now, is Kiev. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2661.4s)]
*  In a feat of arms no one expected, Ukraine's outgunned army defeated the massive Russian [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2665.16s)]
*  force that had been ordered to take the capital city. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2671.68s)]
*  Kiev survives for the moment, a capital of mummified monuments and 19th century grace. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2675.56s)]
*  Before, it was a bumper-to-bumper city with three million residents, but now the streets [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2687.16s)]
*  are congested only by shadows. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2694.52s)]
*  Air raids are still a danger, but after nearly seven weeks, the siren doesn't quicken the [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2698.2799999999997s)]
*  step like it used to. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2704.36s)]
*  Have you won the battle of Kiev? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2707.56s)]
*  I think yes, but this isn't the final victory. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2717.1200000000003s)]
*  I will only be able to tell after we win this war. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2720.7200000000003s)]
*  When we liberate our country, then I'll be able to tell. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2726.04s)]
*  Because Buche is part of Greater Kiev, Buche, Erpin, Hostomel, if the people of those towns [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2731.2s)]
*  were wiped out, then did we win this battle? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2738.4399999999996s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2741.7999999999997s)]
*  We've withstood and we did not give up what is ours, but whether we won, I can't say. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2743.8799999999997s)]
*  No one expected Ukraine to fight Russia to a standstill. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2754.68s)]
*  And I wonder, how did you manage? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2759.88s)]
*  We united as a nation. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2764.4s)]
*  Even though our people understood that they would be outnumbered tenfold and there would [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2767.04s)]
*  be no way out, just no way out, we fought for our existence and for survival. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2772.0s)]
*  That's the combined heroism of everyone, of the people, of the authorities, of the armed [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2781.84s)]
*  forces. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2787.6800000000003s)]
*  We became a single fist. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2788.92s)]
*  We saw the Ukrainian punch in the town of Buche, where the remains of a Russian armored [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2794.9s)]
*  column rusted dead in the street. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2800.96s)]
*  Neighbors holed up for weeks emerged to remember what victory looks like. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2804.88s)]
*  No one seemed in a hurry to deal with the bits of Russian soldiers in the wreckage. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2810.38s)]
*  The full story of how the outmanned Ukrainian army stopped the invasion of Kiev will fill [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2816.64s)]
*  history books. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2823.08s)]
*  But we already know part of it. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2825.08s)]
*  Because the Russians believed that Kiev would fall in a matter of days, they literally did [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2828.2799999999997s)]
*  not bring enough food or fuel for their armored columns. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2832.88s)]
*  On the other side, the Ukrainians had been trained for years by the California National [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2837.42s)]
*  Guard and other U.S. units. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2842.88s)]
*  When the invasion happened, the United States, Britain and other countries flooded Ukraine [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2846.08s)]
*  with lightweight, shoulder-fired anti-tank missiles. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2852.12s)]
*  How much difference have American arms made in this war? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2857.0s)]
*  They're helping. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2862.16s)]
*  Frankly speaking, I would have wanted more. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2863.16s)]
*  I don't know if I have the right to say that. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2866.4s)]
*  But the fact that the United States has helped a lot is true. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2869.04s)]
*  The next man in charge of arming Ukraine is Chief of Staff Andrei Yermak. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2874.56s)]
*  When we met, he just finished a two-hour call with U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2880.48s)]
*  and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2886.56s)]
*  Yermak asked for heavier weapons, faster. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2890.44s)]
*  First, there was artillery. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2894.08s)]
*  The second, we need the tanks. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2896.32s)]
*  We need the military jets. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2898.64s)]
*  And we need everything which gives us the opportunity to close our sky. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2900.96s)]
*  When you ask the Biden administration for artillery, tanks, jet airplanes, the administration [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2906.44s)]
*  says what? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2913.2799999999997s)]
*  We have very deep and very detailed conversation. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2914.3199999999997s)]
*  This is American president who has done for Ukraine more than all other presidents. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2919.08s)]
*  But then you have the war and we are openly said we need more. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2925.48s)]
*  It's not enough. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2931.48s)]
*  We need it as soon as possible. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2932.92s)]
*  If we receive this support in time, we will win. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2935.56s)]
*  A White House official tells us Yermak got a yes to his requests, but filling orders [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2942.32s)]
*  takes time. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2948.66s)]
*  The Ukrainians need Russian-made weapons that they already know how to use. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2950.32s)]
*  The U.S. is cajoling allies to ship their Russian gear now on the promise that the U.S. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2955.52s)]
*  will replace it later. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2961.92s)]
*  America has thrown in nearly $2 billion in military aid. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2964.6800000000003s)]
*  From the Ukrainian point of view, of course, nothing is fast enough. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2969.86s)]
*  Russian bombardment is escalating in the east and south. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2974.48s)]
*  Cities are being shelled to ruin, including Mariupol, with 450,000 residents. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2978.68s)]
*  What are you expecting now in the east and in the south? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2988.3199999999997s)]
*  We think this will be a new wave of this war. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2992.7999999999997s)]
*  We don't know how much Russian weaponry there will be, but we understand there will be many [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=2996.08s)]
*  times more than there is now. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3000.44s)]
*  All depends on how fast we will be helped by the United States. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3002.8s)]
*  To be honest, whether we will be able to survive depends on this. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3009.32s)]
*  I have 100 percent confidence in our people and in our armed forces, but unfortunately [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3014.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't have the confidence that we will be receiving everything we need. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3020.7200000000003s)]
*  And so what are you asking of President Biden? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3025.4s)]
*  To tell you the truth, long ago I asked President Biden for very specific items. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3029.86s)]
*  He has the list. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3035.1s)]
*  President Biden can enter history as the person who stood shoulder to shoulder with the Ukrainian [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3039.26s)]
*  people who won and chose the right to have their own country. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3044.48s)]
*  This also depends on him. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3049.94s)]
*  You are frustrated with President Biden? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3055.3s)]
*  No, I'm not disappointed. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3058.42s)]
*  I don't know how another president in his place would help us. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3062.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3065.94s)]
*  It's difficult. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3066.94s)]
*  We have a good relationship. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3068.7799999999997s)]
*  I think so, at least. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3070.66s)]
*  Ukraine depends on the support of the United States, and I, as the leader of a country [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3073.5s)]
*  at war, I can only be grateful. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3078.54s)]
*  As for the other president at war, we asked Zelensky if he would meet now face to face [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3084.54s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3090.5s)]
*  He told us it was worth the chance. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3092.78s)]
*  They wouldn't resolve everything, Zelensky said, but they might stop the killing. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3094.98s)]
*  Are you willing to give up any part of Ukraine for peace? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3100.92s)]
*  Overall, we're not ready to give away our country. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3105.7400000000002s)]
*  I think we've already given up a lot of lives, so we need to stand firm for as long as we can. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3111.38s)]
*  But this is life. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3117.6600000000003s)]
*  Different things happen. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3119.6200000000003s)]
*  It's negotiable? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3121.06s)]
*  Well, this issue would definitely be raised in the course of negotiations. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3122.54s)]
*  We understand the Russian side. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3127.82s)]
*  We understand one of their provisions that is always talked about is to recognize Crimea [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3129.82s)]
*  as Russian territory. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXD0wqQNo9Y&t=3135.1s)]
