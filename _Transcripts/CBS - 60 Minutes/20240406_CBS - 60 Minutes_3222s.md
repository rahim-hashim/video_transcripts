**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU)
*  If you've ever had the fantasy of soaring over bumper-to-bumper traffic in a flying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=0.0s)]
*  vehicle, that may be possible sooner than you think. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=16.0s)]
*  Not with a flying car, but with a battery-powered aircraft called an EVTOL, a clunky acronym [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=19.44s)]
*  for Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Vehicle. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=25.22s)]
*  As we first reported in April, dozens of companies are spending billions of dollars to make EVTOLs [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=28.8s)]
*  that will operate like air taxis, taking off and landing from what are called vertiports [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=34.8s)]
*  on the tops of buildings, parking garages, or helipads in congested cities. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=40.2s)]
*  EVTOLs promise a faster, safer, and greener mode of transportation, potentially changing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=45.64s)]
*  the way we work and live. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=51.28s)]
*  Sound too good to be true? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=53.24s)]
*  We went for a joyride to find out. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  I will arm the aircraft if you are ready. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=58.0s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=60.6s)]
*  Confirm clear of both. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=61.6s)]
*  If this looks like an oversized drone I'm about to take off in, that's pretty much what it is. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=64.36s)]
*  Breaking ground right there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=70.2s)]
*  It's a single-seat EVTOL called Hexa, powered by 18 propellers, each with its own battery, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=72.4s)]
*  no jet fuel required. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=79.16s)]
*  You are in control. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=81.08s)]
*  Onboard computers automatically adjust for altitude and wind. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=83.4s)]
*  You can really feel the wind up there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  So all I had to do was use a joystick to control Hexa's movement and speed. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  It took about 30 minutes of pre-flight training to get the hang of it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=94.36s)]
*  Use that yaw to rotate 90 degrees. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=98.56s)]
*  Wonderful. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=103.28s)]
*  Hexa is still in its testing phase, so I had to stay close to Chief Pilot, Chase McCown, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  and his ground crew, but they say it's flown up to 195 feet in the air and 24 miles per hour. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=110.12s)]
*  Whenever you're ready, you can come back to home. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=116.72s)]
*  The batteries last up to 15 minutes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=119.0s)]
*  I was going to throw it over the camera. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=121.48s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=123.32s)]
*  To land, I maneuvered Hexa into position, pressed a button, and the computers did the rest. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=124.96s)]
*  Right there, you are on the ground and the propellers spinning down. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=130.76s)]
*  That is cool. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=136.36s)]
*  I'm so happy. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=138.76s)]
*  Piece of cake, right? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=140.16s)]
*  That was awesome. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=141.16s)]
*  That is so much fun. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=142.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=143.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=144.16s)]
*  I so just want to like take off with it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=145.16s)]
*  Matt Chason is CEO of Austin-based Lyft Aircraft, which makes Hexa. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=146.6s)]
*  He envisions a future where it's used by commuters to skip rush hour traffic. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=151.48s)]
*  You can fly 10 miles in 10 minutes instead of spending over an hour on the roads during [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=156.64s)]
*  rush hour congestion. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=163.44s)]
*  Would it be something that an individual then in the future owns and flies from their house [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=164.96s)]
*  to somewhere? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  We don't see individual ownership as very practical. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  These are very expensive aircraft. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  We see putting fleets of aircraft at locations where we provide maintenance, we provide training, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=174.44s)]
*  and people can come in and basically pay per flight. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=181.52s)]
*  But that's still a long way off. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=184.48s)]
*  Federal, state, and local regulators, not to mention the nation's airspace, aren't ready [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=186.6s)]
*  for hundreds of thousands of commuters piloting their own EV tolls in the skies over congested [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=191.36s)]
*  cities. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=197.28s)]
*  So to give people a taste of the future now, Chason designed Hexa as an ultralight vehicle, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=199.0s)]
*  which means it doesn't have to go through the Federal Aviation Administration's complex [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=204.2s)]
*  certification process, but also can't fly over populated areas. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=208.36s)]
*  Chason plans to start offering rides to paying customers for $250 by the end of this year. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=213.8s)]
*  The initial market you see is essentially joy rides for people. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=220.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a huge market for people to just experience the thrill and joy of flight. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=223.56s)]
*  Around the world, all kinds of EV tolls are being developed. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=231.84s)]
*  Cargo carriers, air ambulances, and a whole lot of air taxis. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=235.48s)]
*  Some with a pilot, some without. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=240.32s)]
*  The Air Force is investing, so is Airbus and American Airlines. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  And dozens of companies are already working with the FAA. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=247.6s)]
*  It's not the flying cars that science fiction movies anticipated. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=252.32s)]
*  No, but when you think about it, I look back over the arc of my own career, having been [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=256.36s)]
*  a pilot for 42 years, and I'm just amazed by the amount of innovation that has taken [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=261.12s)]
*  place. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=266.56s)]
*  Billy Nolan was head of safety for the FAA before being named acting administrator in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=267.56s)]
*  March. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=272.28s)]
*  How difficult a certification process is there? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=273.28s)]
*  Because there's a lot of moving parts to this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=275.92s)]
*  First, we have to certify the design of the aircraft itself, and then we look at how it [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=277.72s)]
*  will operate. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  Is it piloted? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  Is it autonomous? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  We look at where we'll operate. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=286.48s)]
*  So that means how do we put it within our nation's airspace? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  So once it's met that safety threshold, and only until it's met that safety threshold, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=291.46000000000004s)]
*  will we be prepared to certify it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=296.6s)]
*  Some EV toll companies are well on their way. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  He flew in a gas guzzling helicopter with one of the frontrunners in this air taxi arms [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=303.16s)]
*  race, Joe Ben Bevert, CEO of Joby Aviation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=307.88000000000005s)]
*  He took us to this remote facility in California where he was testing his EV toll Joby aircraft. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=312.48s)]
*  As we landed, it felt like the old guard meeting the new. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=318.44000000000005s)]
*  Obviously it's a combination of a helicopter and a plane. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=323.16s)]
*  Exactly, so it can take off like a helicopter, but it flies with the efficiency of an airplane. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=326.48s)]
*  Bevert has been working on the Joby for more than a decade. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=330.8s)]
*  It has six propellers and four batteries in its wings and will operate as an air taxi, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=334.04s)]
*  carrying a pilot and four passengers. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=339.6s)]
*  He says it can fly 150 miles on a single charge and has a top speed of around 200 miles an [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=342.48s)]
*  hour. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=349.08000000000004s)]
*  Why this design? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=350.36s)]
*  So vertical takeoff is important so we can take you to where you want to go, right? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=351.5s)]
*  We don't need a huge runway and then with the wing it gives you the efficiency to fly [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=356.32s)]
*  far and to fly fast. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=361.08s)]
*  Because it's still being tested, the Joby was piloted remotely by a nearby ground crew. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=365.0s)]
*  When they fired up the motors, unlike a helicopter, the Joby didn't need time to warm up. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=371.08s)]
*  It took off in about 20 seconds. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=377.0s)]
*  That's it? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=381.2s)]
*  That's really quiet. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=382.2s)]
*  We wanted this to sound more like the wind in the trees than the wop wop of a helicopter. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=384.04s)]
*  Noise levels are a critical issue since EV tolls are meant to take off and land near [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  where people work and live. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=393.36s)]
*  This is below the background noise level of many cities. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  I go around with my decibel meter on my phone and measure sound levels. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  That's what you've been doing for 10 years? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=402.72s)]
*  Exactly, because we needed to make sure that the aircraft was going to be quiet enough. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=404.36s)]
*  Bevert studied mechanical engineering at Stanford where he invented this popular flexible camera [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  tripod and later created a company that made flying wind turbines. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=413.6s)]
*  But the Joby had remained an elusive dream. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=418.0s)]
*  There were definitely skeptics, even good friends of mine, who didn't believe that you [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=421.72s)]
*  could make this with batteries and electric propulsion. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=427.68s)]
*  The battery technology just wasn't there, it wouldn't work. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=430.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=434.0s)]
*  Bevert hired John Wagner away from Tesla where he helped develop the car's revolutionary [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=435.0s)]
*  batteries. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=439.64000000000004s)]
*  At Joby, he figured out a way to make the batteries lighter but still powerful enough [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=440.68s)]
*  to get the two ton EV toll off the ground. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  You had to play to the strengths of battery power and the strengths of electric motors. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=448.24s)]
*  So a typical aircraft might have one big motor, but we can have six motors distributed throughout [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=452.86s)]
*  the aircraft and in that way operate in a much more efficient manner. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=457.74s)]
*  The weight of everything must be the most important thing. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=461.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=465.4s)]
*  So how do you make a plane as light as possible? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=466.4s)]
*  You essentially have to engineer every piece of it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=469.32s)]
*  The outside of the Joby is made with layers of lightweight carbon fiber. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=472.44s)]
*  The batteries, as well as computers, electronics and motors, are constructed under John Wagner's [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=476.44s)]
*  watch and his team shakes, bakes and spins them to ensure they'll meet the FAA's rigorous [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=481.8s)]
*  safety standards. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=488.2s)]
*  They have to certify the aircraft as being safe and capable of flying to their standards. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=489.8s)]
*  They also have to certify the production of all the parts of it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=495.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=499.24s)]
*  And the operation, the pilot training, the maintenance steps, every facet is heavily [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=500.24s)]
*  regulated. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=506.0s)]
*  All this costs a lot of money. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  Toyota has invested about $400 million in Joby and Bevert took the company public last [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=509.12s)]
*  year. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=514.6s)]
*  Billionaire Paul Sciara, co-founder of the website Pinterest, has also put in a small [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=517.12s)]
*  fortune. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=521.52s)]
*  He's Joby's executive chairman and says they'll launch in up to three cities and that passengers [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=522.52s)]
*  will eventually end up paying around $3 to $4 a mile to fly, a little more than an average [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=527.8s)]
*  Uber ride. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=533.64s)]
*  Can you just take me through as a passenger what it looks like? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=534.64s)]
*  I want to get to JFK Airport. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  It's bumper to bumper traffic. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=539.68s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=540.68s)]
*  Take out your phone, pull out an app, and with one click, you're booking the whole trip. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=542.24s)]
*  So a car is coming to wherever you are in Manhattan. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=547.04s)]
*  It's taking you to the takeoff and landing location, the Verta port, and you're hopping [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=549.68s)]
*  in your Joby and it's flying you to your final destination. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=554.2199999999999s)]
*  Maybe there's a car at the other end or you're just walking to the tail end. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=557.8000000000001s)]
*  If people are taking cars to and from Verta ports, doesn't that just add to congestion? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=560.96s)]
*  If we're able to take out 80% of the miles that people might be traveling and move those [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=566.58s)]
*  miles from congested roads to the air, I think that's going to have an impact. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=573.44s)]
*  But just a few weeks after we saw this Joby aircraft fly, it crashed in February due to [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=578.64s)]
*  what federal investigators called a component failure. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=584.08s)]
*  No one was hurt, but the eVTOL was totaled. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  Bevert says that's all part of the testing process and is as optimistic now as he was [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=591.32s)]
*  when we interviewed him. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=596.6800000000001s)]
*  How far are you from getting the first Joby in the sky with passengers? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=598.5200000000001s)]
*  So we are launching our service in 2024. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=603.4000000000001s)]
*  You think you can do it that quickly? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=605.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=607.0400000000001s)]
*  There have been, though, a lot of companies that have said, oh, we're going to do this [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=608.0400000000001s)]
*  in two years and then it doesn't happen. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=609.9200000000001s)]
*  We're very confident. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=613.24s)]
*  There's a lot of confidence over at Whisk Aero as well, though the eVTOL they're developing [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=615.76s)]
*  will be even more complicated to bring to market because it's fully autonomous. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=620.88s)]
*  There'll be passengers, but no pilot on board. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  You're not just figuring out an electric vehicle. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=629.36s)]
*  You're figuring out a fully autonomous flying vehicle. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=632.6s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=635.92s)]
*  We're going for it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=636.92s)]
*  You and I talked about that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=637.92s)]
*  CEO Gary Gyssen says they're on track to spend about $2 billion. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=640.76s)]
*  The company is bankrolled by Boeing and Google co-founder Larry Page. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=644.8s)]
*  They've been testing the technology for the last eight years. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=649.3199999999999s)]
*  So how many test flights have you actually done? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=655.68s)]
*  So close to 1,600 test flights without an incident. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=657.64s)]
*  We watched one of those test flights in Hollister, California. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=664.0s)]
*  A team of engineers about half a mile away started the eVTOL with the click of a mouse. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  The entire route was pre-programmed. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=674.52s)]
*  Why autonomous? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=681.12s)]
*  Why go this route? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=682.12s)]
*  So we're going straight to self-flying. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=683.12s)]
*  Several reasons. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=684.76s)]
*  One, it's safer. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=685.76s)]
*  Safer, he says, because most plane accidents involve human error. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=686.76s)]
*  The launch of commercial aviation is already automated, and Gyssen sees the entire eVTOL [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=691.4s)]
*  industry going that way eventually. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=696.3199999999999s)]
*  He's determined to get there first. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=698.92s)]
*  We do it primarily from a safety perspective, but also scale. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=701.3199999999999s)]
*  So if you don't have a pilot in the aircraft, it's less expensive. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=704.9399999999999s)]
*  You don't have to do pilot training. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=708.14s)]
*  You're flying four passengers. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=710.18s)]
*  We can charge less. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=712.78s)]
*  We don't want this to be a premium helicopter-like service. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=713.9599999999999s)]
*  We want this to be a service that's affordable to the masses. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=717.02s)]
*  There is a hurdle psychologically for people to get into an aircraft that does not have [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=720.6s)]
*  a human at the control. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=726.02s)]
*  Of course. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=727.32s)]
*  And so what we're trying to do with that is each passenger can be in verbal communication [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=728.32s)]
*  with the ground. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=734.08s)]
*  They can be talking to a pilot whenever they want to. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=735.08s)]
*  So it's all designed to provide comfort. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=737.3000000000001s)]
*  It will take time. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=740.28s)]
*  This isn't going to happen overnight. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=741.28s)]
*  Gyssen wants to launch Wist's four-seater air taxi service in the world's 20 busiest [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=743.0s)]
*  cities within the next decade. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=747.6s)]
*  You don't give a date of when you think you'll be operational. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=750.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=754.08s)]
*  You know why we don't do that? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=755.08s)]
*  Because we are not in control of that part. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=756.24s)]
*  The FAA is in Europe. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=758.88s)]
*  It's called the ASSA. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=760.92s)]
*  They're in charge. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=762.04s)]
*  So when they certify aircraft to fly, that's when you fly. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=763.4s)]
*  The FAA won't say when an autonomous EV toll might be certified, but acting administrator [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=767.2s)]
*  Billy Nolan told us hailing a piloted air taxi by 2024 is well within the realm of possibility. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=773.04s)]
*  The challenge for us is to make sure that innovation doesn't come at the expense of [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  safety. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=784.84s)]
*  But clearly we are seeing the emergence of something that's fantastic, I think. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=785.84s)]
*  This is real. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=791.12s)]
*  I mean, this is no longer just the stuff of fantasy. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=792.12s)]
*  We want to be very careful. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=796.12s)]
*  We want to be very measured. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=797.6s)]
*  But you're absolutely right. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=799.0400000000001s)]
*  This is real and this is happening. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=800.52s)]
*  We've come a long way from where we were just a mere decade ago. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=802.64s)]
*  If you have ever suffered through what felt like an endless flight on a cramped plane, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=809.96s)]
*  you might jump at the chance to get to your destination in half the time. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=819.48s)]
*  Does New York to Los Angeles in under three hours sound appealing? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=824.0400000000001s)]
*  The last commercial supersonic flight was almost 20 years ago. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=827.96s)]
*  And even then, superfast flights were only on very limited routes. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=832.2s)]
*  Most of today's jetliners actually fly more slowly than they did 20 or 30 years ago in [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=837.12s)]
*  order to save fuel. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=842.68s)]
*  But that may be about to change. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  It's still a long shot. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=847.4s)]
*  But as we first reported last November, private startup companies with a big assist from NASA [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=849.04s)]
*  may just give us all another chance to fly faster than the speed of sound. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=855.32s)]
*  When British Airways flight 002 roared into the New York sky on October 24th, 2003, everyone [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=862.12s)]
*  on board, passengers and pilots, knew that something special was coming to an end. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=872.36s)]
*  Enjoy the moment. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=877.96s)]
*  Visual on the last people in the world as passengers to cruise at twice the speed of sound. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=879.48s)]
*  The supersonic Concorde, a joint effort of the British and French governments, was making [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=884.84s)]
*  its last flight after nearly 30 years in the air, grounded by a combination of stratospheric [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=889.5999999999999s)]
*  costs and safety concerns after a deadly crash in 2000. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=895.76s)]
*  Even people watching that last landing in London were emotional. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=900.64s)]
*  I just love airplanes. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=904.0s)]
*  And there's not going to be anything like Concorde again, is there? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=906.4799999999999s)]
*  Never. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=909.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, you know that old maxim, never say never. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=910.0799999999999s)]
*  The supersonic's coming back. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=913.4s)]
*  And it's going to be different this time. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=915.9599999999999s)]
*  It's back to stay. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=917.3599999999999s)]
*  Blake Scholl is the founder and CEO of Boom. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=918.64s)]

*  Has a private company ever built a supersonic aircraft? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=928.72s)]
*  Nowhere. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=933.96s)]
*  It's been governments and militaries only. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=934.96s)]
*  Boom is not the only American startup company in the new supersonic sweepstakes. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=937.4s)]
*  Spike is developing an ultra-fast business jet. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=943.0s)]
*  And Hermias aspires to make a hypersonic plane that would fly five times the speed of sound. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=946.6s)]
*  But Boom is the only entrant to actually build an airplane. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=953.0s)]
*  This is it? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=956.8000000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=958.2s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=959.2s)]
*  So far, Blake Scholl and Boom have built this single-seater test plane, which they hope [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=960.2s)]
*  will fly this year. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=966.08s)]
*  The passenger jet meant to follow is called Overture. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=968.0400000000001s)]
*  It only exists in artist renderings, but it's real enough for one of America's largest [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=971.78s)]
*  airlines to climb on board. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=977.26s)]
*  So is the Overture the plane that United recently ordered? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=979.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=983.22s)]
*  United just ordered 15 Overture airplanes. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=984.22s)]
*  So more Overtures than Concords were ever delivered into service. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=988.6999999999999s)]
*  Is this United deal like a stamp of approval? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=992.5s)]
*  I think it's incredibly validating. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=995.9s)]
*  When you are United, you take these things really seriously. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=997.74s)]
*  Seriously enough to produce a slick promotional video that's already playing on many United [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1002.02s)]
*  flights. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1007.94s)]
*  The ad may say supersonic is here, but it's not. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1010.78s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1015.1800000000001s)]
*  Blake Scholl is a software engineer who started his career at Amazon, not in aerospace. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1016.34s)]
*  But he insists he's going to make it happen. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1022.44s)]
*  When I look several decades out, what I want is to be able to be anywhere in the world [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1025.64s)]
*  in four hours for $100. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1030.92s)]
*  Now that's not where we start, but that's the end goal. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1033.4s)]
*  The Concord charged thousands, thousands of dollars for a one-way flight from New York [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1035.92s)]
*  to London. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1042.88s)]
*  How is it going to be possible for you to have a similar flight experience for $100? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1044.76s)]
*  You keep iterating. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1050.6200000000001s)]
*  And so the same way, for example, electric cars, when they first came out, they were [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1051.68s)]
*  pretty expensive. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1055.54s)]
*  But we kept working on them. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1056.54s)]
*  And the price came down. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1057.68s)]
*  They got better and better. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1058.68s)]
*  And so we're going to do the same thing with supersonic jets. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1059.68s)]
*  We're going to keep working on them. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1061.28s)]
*  We're going to keep innovating. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1062.28s)]
*  This industry needs people dreaming big. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1063.96s)]
*  That is essential. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1067.16s)]
*  This industry was built on that. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1068.46s)]
*  John Ostrower is editor-in-chief of The Air Current, a publication that tracks every development [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1070.68s)]
*  in commercial aviation, including Boom and Blake Scholl. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1076.54s)]
*  He admits that something like he is proposing has never been done by a private company before. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1081.26s)]
*  But yet he's convinced that he can do it. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1089.9s)]
*  Do you think he can? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1094.68s)]
*  I think you cannot ignore the obstacles that will be on the path to getting there. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1096.34s)]
*  And I think the amount of money that is required to make this happen makes this a very long [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1101.98s)]
*  shot. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1109.1s)]
*  How much money will it take? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1110.1s)]
*  Probably in the neighborhood of at least $15 or $20 billion. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1113.6999999999998s)]
*  Ostrower says that's about what it cost Boeing to develop and build and certify a new subsonic [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1117.3799999999999s)]
*  airliner. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1124.3s)]
*  And they already have huge manufacturing facilities. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1125.62s)]
*  Boom doesn't. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1128.74s)]
*  Blake Scholl told us he can get Overture built for $7 to $8 billion. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1130.82s)]
*  But that's a lot more than the $300 million he's raised so far. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1136.08s)]
*  And money's not the only hurdle. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1140.36s)]
*  Boom and United have promised their new plane will operate on 100% sustainable aviation [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1142.56s)]
*  fuel. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1148.8s)]
*  But that doesn't exist yet in anything like the quantities they'll need. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1149.8s)]
*  Oh, and one other thing. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1153.96s)]
*  They're going to need an engine to do this. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1156.36s)]
*  And they don't have the engine? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1158.1599999999999s)]
*  They don't have an engine. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1159.1599999999999s)]
*  Blake Scholl says an engine is on the way from the same company that built the supersonic [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1160.68s)]
*  engines for the Concorde. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1165.88s)]
*  And we are working with Rolls-Royce on a custom jet engine that will power Overture. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1168.24s)]
*  You're working with Rolls-Royce. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1173.16s)]
*  This engine does not exist yet? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1175.72s)]
*  It is a lightly customized engine. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1177.52s)]
*  And part of that is Rolls-Royce's work, where they're kind of turning some design knobs. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1180.3200000000002s)]
*  Blake Scholl doesn't dismiss the skeptics, but he points to the example of Elon Musk [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1184.3600000000001s)]
*  and says not so long ago, no one thought he could build Teslas and reusable rockets. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1189.84s)]
*  Where does this passion come from? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1196.6s)]
*  It's because we stopped making progress on the speed of travel. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1198.32s)]
*  The airplanes we have today are no faster than the ones we had when my parents were [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1201.76s)]
*  growing up. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1205.56s)]
*  And there is no good reason for that. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1206.84s)]
*  It doesn't have to be. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1209.4s)]
*  We can fix it. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1210.4s)]
*  When do you expect the first paying customers to fly on one of your planes? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1211.4s)]
*  By the end of the decade. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1217.12s)]
*  Sonic really only makes sense on flights of four or five hours or more. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1219.72s)]
*  But thousands of such routes are out of reach to Boom. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1224.4s)]
*  The reason is in the very name of his company. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1228.0s)]
*  That's the sound of a sonic boom created by a plane breaking the sound barrier. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1233.0s)]
*  Listen again. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1238.36s)]
*  The first boom was made by Chuck Yeager's X1 rocket plane when it passed through Mach [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1241.64s)]
*  660 miles per hour back in 1947. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1247.12s)]
*  And he does it. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1251.06s)]
*  What is the son of boom what generates it. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1255.36s)]
*  When an aircraft flies faster than the speed of sound it [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1259.7399999999998s)]
*  creates disturbances Mike Bonanno is a top engineer at [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1262.6399999999999s)]

*  a boat. And so imagine that wake from speedboat or whatever [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1276.7s)]
*  all those different waves coming to be one large wave. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1279.8000000000002s)]
*  Those individual disturbances created up by the airplane. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1282.8600000000001s)]
*  They combine together to make a loud double bang. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1285.8400000000001s)]
*  The Federal Aviation Administration tested the impact [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1288.64s)]
*  of that big bang back in 1964 by flying military supersonic [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1291.8000000000002s)]
*  jets like these over Oklahoma City for six months. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1297.24s)]
*  The outcome. Broken bricks and ceilings frayed nerves [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1301.3200000000002s)]
*  and public outrage. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1306.0s)]
*  It was just [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1308.34s)]
*  patently obvious that no one was going to tolerate such a [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1309.72s)]
*  loud noise on a day to day basis. The result was a ban [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1312.32s)]
*  on civilian supersonic flights everywhere in the world other [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1316.18s)]
*  than over open water. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1319.96s)]
*  And that basically hit the brakes on the development of [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1321.76s)]
*  commercial air travel in terms of advancing speed up until [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1324.8s)]
*  that ban every decade air travel had gotten faster and [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1328.76s)]
*  faster. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1332.7s)]
*  The ban remains in place today. So if boom gets its overture [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1333.76s)]
*  in the air, it will only be able to serve long trans oceanic [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1338.1s)]
*  routes similar to what the Concorde flew. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1342.1599999999999s)]
*  So if you want to go from JFK in New York to Paris, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1344.8999999999999s)]
*  that's OK. But for many of us, we want to fly places over land [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1349.1399999999999s)]
*  here living in Los Angeles, almost everywhere I want to go [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1353.54s)]
*  flying East requires overland travel. And that's one of the [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1356.82s)]
*  big problems that we're trying to solve. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1360.4199999999998s)]
*  Well, none and Richardson and their Lockheed Martin team have [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1362.1399999999999s)]
*  been commissioned by NASA to build a test plane that can [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1365.98s)]
*  fly twice as fast as current airliners without rattling [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1369.4399999999998s)]
*  nerves or breaking windows. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1372.98s)]
*  Your mission is to get rid of this sonic boom. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1375.76s)]
*  That's right the entire point of the airplane it is to reduce [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1380.22s)]
*  sonic boom. The airplane is called the X 59 it will look [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1384.46s)]
*  like this when it makes its first flight later this year. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1389.02s)]

*  we're now going supersonic. Yep, you know, supersonic. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1507.0s)]
*  Larsen gave me a turn in the cockpit not to fly supersonic [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1509.98s)]

*  This takes it to a little bit different. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1861.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1863.54s)]
*  The competition is fierce. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1864.34s)]
*  So much so their technology is akin to a state secret. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1866.0s)]
*  But Price points us to a network of sensors, cameras and radar [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1869.8999999999999s)]
*  devices strapped to the outside of the rig. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1873.54s)]
*  All of it hardwired to an internal A.I. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1876.44s)]
*  supercomputer that drives the truck itself contained. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1879.08s)]
*  So a bad Wi-Fi signal won't wreak havoc on the road. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1882.72s)]
*  Our system can see farther than any other autonomous system in [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1886.22s)]
*  the world. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1890.52s)]
*  We can see forward over a half mile. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1891.12s)]
*  You can drive autonomously at night. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1893.7s)]
*  We can day, night and in the rain and in the rain at night. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1895.6599999999999s)]
*  And they're working on driving in the snow. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1899.56s)]
*  Chuck Price has unshakable confidence in the reliability [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1902.0s)]
*  of the technology, as do some of the biggest names in [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1905.3799999999999s)]

*  Postal Service ship freight with two simple trucks. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1911.22s)]
*  All in each unit costs more than a quarter million dollars. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1914.72s)]
*  Not a great expense considering it's designed to eliminate the [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1918.42s)]
*  annual salary of a driver. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1921.96s)]
*  Currently around $45,000. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1923.92s)]

*  two days, not four, stopping only to refuel. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1930.82s)]
*  Though a human still has to do that. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1935.0s)]
*  We wanted to hop in and experience automated trucking [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1938.46s)]
*  firsthand. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1941.5s)]

*  Chuck Price was happy to oblige. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1945.3999999999999s)]
*  We didn't know what to expect. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1949.08s)]
*  So we fashioned more cameras to the rig than NASA glued to the [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1950.4199999999998s)]

*  Three, two, one. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=1958.8s)]

*  We can read license plates. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2045.48s)]
*  So if there was an accessible database for something like [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2047.1200000000001s)]
*  that, we could. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2050.26s)]

*  He adds that driverless trucks are more fuel efficient in part [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2352.96s)]

*  What happens is when you're reading [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2485.72s)]
*  or when you're talking to yourself, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2487.22s)]
*  your brain transmits electrical signals to your vocal cords. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2488.66s)]
*  You can actually pick these signals up, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2492.36s)]

*  that you would normally speak, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2503.48s)]

*  Indistinguishable to the fact that the computer [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2665.46s)]

*  It's indistinguishable for magic. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2670.26s)]
*  In 1979, MIT developed Movie Map, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2675.46s)]

*  And the MIT patent lawyers looked at it and said, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2740.6000000000004s)]
*  this will never happen, never be done, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2744.0400000000004s)]

*  and to fit better in our lives. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2780.02s)]
*  Professor Patti Maz ran the graduate program student [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2782.92s)]
*  admissions for more than a decade. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2786.16s)]

*  We don't have to tell them to work hard. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2792.5s)]
*  We have to tell them to work less hard [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2795.24s)]
*  and to get sleep occasionally. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2798.1s)]
*  How often does a student come to you with an idea [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2800.1s)]
*  and you think, we're not going to do that? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2802.64s)]
*  Actually, for us, the crazier, the better. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2805.2799999999997s)]
*  Typically, there's some blood vessels running. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2808.18s)]
*  Adam Harhorowitz's idea was so nutty, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2810.1s)]
*  he was one of 50 new students admitted last year out [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2812.74s)]
*  of 1,300 applications. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2816.74s)]
*  I was really interested in a state of sleep [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2819.48s)]
*  where you start to dream before you're fully unconscious, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2821.12s)]
*  where you keep coming up with ideas right [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2824.38s)]
*  as you're about to go to sleep. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2826.78s)]
*  Time to go to sleep. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2828.2599999999998s)]
*  Harhorowitz's system plants ideas for dreams. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2829.82s)]
*  Remember to think of a mountain. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2833.82s)]
*  Then records conversations with the dreamer [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2835.72s)]
*  during that semi-conscious moment before you fall asleep. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2838.68s)]
*  Tell me, what are you thinking? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2843.12s)]
*  I'm doing an origami pyramid. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2845.18s)]
*  Her origami pyramid dream was influenced by the robot [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2848.72s)]
*  saying the word mountain. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2852.7s)]
*  It's long been believed that this is the moment when [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2854.7999999999997s)]
*  the mind is its most creative. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2857.96s)]
*  Harhorowitz hopes to capture ideas that we often [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2860.36s)]
*  lose by the next morning. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2864.24s)]
*  So it's basically like a conversation. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2866.1s)]
*  You can ask, hey, Jibo, I'd like to dream about a rabbit [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2867.84s)]
*  tonight. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2870.54s)]
*  It would watch for that trigger of unconsciousness. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2871.78s)]
*  And then right as you're hitting the lip, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2873.6800000000003s)]
*  it triggers you with the audio, and it asks you, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2875.34s)]
*  what is it that you're thinking about? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2877.78s)]
*  You record all that sleep talking, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2879.52s)]
*  and then later, when you wake up fully, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2881.5600000000004s)]
*  you can ask for those recordings. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2883.52s)]
*  And when he brought this idea to you, what did you think? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2885.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2888.8s)]
*  Crazy enough. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2890.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2891.0s)]
*  Welcome to the world of bodies and motions. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2892.26s)]
*  Nearby in Hugh Herr's lab, Everett Lawson's brain [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2895.0s)]
*  is connected to his prosthetic foot, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2898.96s)]
*  a replacement for the club foot he was born with. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2901.9s)]
*  The very definition of a leg or a limb or an ankle [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2904.8s)]
*  is going to dramatically change with what they're doing. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2908.7400000000002s)]
*  It isn't just whole. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2911.28s)]
*  It's 150%. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2912.44s)]
*  You feel directly connected, huh? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2915.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2917.48s)]
*  When I fire a muscle really fast, it makes its full sweep. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2918.6800000000003s)]
*  Herr's team has electronically connected the computers [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2922.22s)]
*  and the robotic foot with the muscles and nerves [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2925.46s)]
*  in Lawson's leg. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2928.8199999999997s)]
*  He's not only able to control via his thoughts. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2930.2999999999997s)]
*  He can actually feel the design synthetic limb. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2933.24s)]
*  He feels the joints moving as if the joints are [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2937.04s)]
*  made of skin and bone. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2940.2s)]
*  So you're going to test on him. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2941.94s)]
*  For Professor Herr, necessity was the mother of invention. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2943.14s)]
*  He lost his legs to frostbite at age 17 [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2947.62s)]
*  after he was stranded by a winter storm [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2951.3799999999997s)]
*  while mountain climbing. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2953.8799999999997s)]
*  Through that recovery process, my limbs are amputated. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2955.3799999999997s)]
*  I designed my own limbs. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2959.08s)]
*  I returned to my sport of mountain climbing. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2960.3799999999997s)]
*  I was climbing better than I'd achieved [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2963.06s)]
*  with normal biological limbs. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2965.3199999999997s)]
*  That experience was so inspiring because I realized [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2967.4199999999996s)]
*  the power of technology to heal, to rehabilitate, and even [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2970.7999999999997s)]
*  extend human capability beyond natural physiological levels. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2974.8599999999997s)]
*  You developed the legs that you're wearing today. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2980.1s)]
*  Each leg has three computers, actually, and 12 sensors. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2982.96s)]
*  And they run these computations based on the sensory information [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2986.5s)]
*  that's coming in. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2990.04s)]
*  And then what's controlled is a motor system, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2991.14s)]
*  like muscle, that drives me as I walk [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2993.74s)]
*  and enable me to walk at different speeds. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2996.64s)]
*  What will this mean for people with disabilities? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=2999.62s)]
*  Technology is freeing. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3003.48s)]
*  It removes the shackles of disability from humans. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3005.2799999999997s)]
*  And the vision of the Media Lab is that one day, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3008.48s)]
*  through advances in technologies, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3011.7400000000002s)]
*  we will eliminate all disability. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3013.78s)]
*  So that was a big deal because then when you get to the end... [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3016.42s)]
*  The current director of the Media Lab is Joey Ito, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3018.52s)]
*  a four-time college dropout and one of those misfits [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3021.42s)]
*  that the lab prefers. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3025.12s)]
*  After success in high-tech venture capital, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3027.46s)]
*  he came here to preside over the lab's 30 faculty [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3030.3s)]
*  and a $75 million annual budget. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3033.7400000000002s)]
*  How do you pay for all this? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3037.08s)]
*  So we have 90 companies that pay us a membership fee [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3038.92s)]
*  to join the consortium. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3043.56s)]
*  And then because it's all coming into one pot, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3045.46s)]
*  I can distribute the funds to our faculty and students, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3048.6s)]
*  and they don't have to write grant proposals. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3052.0s)]
*  You don't have to ask for permission. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3053.8s)]
*  They just make things. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3055.1s)]
*  Do any of these companies lean on you from time to time [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3056.64s)]
*  and say, hey, we need some product here? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3059.98s)]
*  They do. I fired companies for that. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3062.08s)]
*  You fired them? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3064.04s)]
*  Yeah, I've told companies you're too bottom-line-oriented. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3065.1s)]
*  Maybe we're not right for you. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3067.64s)]
*  The sponsors, which include Lego, the toy maker, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3070.58s)]
*  Toshiba, Exxon Mobil, and General Electric, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3073.32s)]
*  get first crack at inventions. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3076.82s)]
*  The lab holds 302 patents and counting. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3079.38s)]
*  We're inside of the lab. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3083.36s)]
*  Caleb Harper's idea is so big, it doesn't fit in the building. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3084.66s)]
*  So MIT donated the site of an abandoned particle accelerator [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3089.0s)]
*  for this trained architect who is now building farms. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3092.98s)]
*  Welcome to the farm. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3097.62s)]
*  He calls these food computers, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3098.92s)]
*  farms where conditions are perfect. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3101.56s)]
*  They're all capable of controlling climate. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3104.12s)]
*  So they make a recipe. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3106.36s)]
*  This much CO2, this much O2, this temperature. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3108.2000000000003s)]
*  So we create a world in a box. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3111.04s)]
*  Most people understand if you say, oh, the tomatoes [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3113.04s)]
*  in Tuscany on the North Slope taste so good, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3115.6s)]
*  and you can't get them anywhere else. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3118.58s)]
*  That's those genetics under those conditions [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3120.36s)]
*  that cause that beautiful tomato. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3123.5s)]
*  So we study that inside of these boxes [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3125.44s)]
*  with sensors and the ability to control climate. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3127.6000000000004s)]
*  Tuscany in a box. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3129.7000000000003s)]
*  Tuscany in a box, Napa in a box, Bordeaux in a box. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3130.8s)]
*  Now these are plants you're growing in air. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3134.0800000000004s)]
*  These basil plants grow not in soil but in air. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3137.34s)]
*  The plant is super happy. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3140.78s)]
*  No dirt. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3142.1200000000003s)]
*  Air saturated with a custom mix of moisture and nutrients. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3143.38s)]
*  So each one of these are drops that drops down [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3147.5800000000004s)]
*  to the reservoir. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3149.16s)]
*  The food computers grow almost anything, anywhere. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3150.5s)]
*  What have you learned about cotton farming? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3154.44s)]
*  So cotton is actually a perennial plant, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3156.44s)]
*  which means it would grow the whole year long. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3159.2799999999997s)]
*  But it's treated like an annual. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3162.14s)]
*  We have a season. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3163.3399999999997s)]
*  So in this environment, since it's perfect for cotton, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3164.64s)]
*  we've had plants go 12 months. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3167.02s)]
*  So how many crops can you get in a controlled environment? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3169.04s)]
*  You can crop up to four or five seasons. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3172.22s)]
*  We're growing, on average, three to four times faster [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3174.62s)]
*  than they can grow in the field. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3177.56s)]
*  The uncommon growth of the media lab [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3179.8s)]
*  flows from its refusal to be bound to goals, contracts, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3182.54s)]
*  or next quarter's profits. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3186.48s)]
*  It is simply a ship of exploration, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3189.04s)]
*  going wherever a crazy idea may lead. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3192.2400000000002s)]
*  We get to think about the future. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3196.2400000000002s)]
*  What does the world look like 10 years, 20 years, 30 years? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3198.28s)]
*  What should it look like? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3200.92s)]
*  The best way to predict the future is to invent it. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8da36xsbOU&t=3202.6600000000003s)]
