*  It's big techs out to get conservatives. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=0.0s)]
*  That's not a suspicion. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=8.84s)]
*  That's not a hunch. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=9.92s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=10.92s)]
*  CONSERVATIVES ARE MAKING SERIOUS LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES FREE SPEECH [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=11.92s)]
*  ON SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=18.72s)]
*  WHAT ARE FACTS? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=21.18s)]
*  WHAT IS MISINFORMATION AND IS POLICING THEM CENSORSHIP? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=22.62s)]
*  All of this being decided months before the 2024 election. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=27.68s)]
*  I think you let the American people respect the American people, their common sense, to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=32.08s)]
*  figure out what's accurate, what isn't. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=37.08s)]
*  The crisis on the U.S. southern border has emerged as one of the most important issues [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=41.8s)]
*  in this year's presidential election. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=46.04s)]
*  But it's this president, Mexico's controversial Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who may have [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=49.4s)]
*  more control over what happens there than anyone. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=55.64s)]
*  Your critics have said what you're doing or what you're asking for to help secure the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=58.56s)]
*  border is diplomatic blackmail. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=63.4s)]
*  168 countries, including China, have signed on to the United Nations Law of the Sea, a [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=66.24s)]
*  treaty that divvies up the international seabed for the mining of precious metals vital for [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=74.68s)]
*  everything from electric cars to defense systems. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=80.08s)]
*  Absent from the treaty, the United States. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=83.76s)]
*  The United States probably has got the most to gain of any country in the world if it [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  were party to the Law of the Sea Convention. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=92.36s)]
*  And conversely, we actually probably have the most to lose by not being part of it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=95.18s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=102.28s)]

*  Visit progressive.com. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=123.64s)]
*  As big tech firms wrestle with how to keep false and harmful information off their social [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  networks, the Supreme Court is wrestling with whether platforms like Facebook and Twitter, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=137.28s)]
*  now called X, have the right to decide what users can say on their sites. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  The dispute centers on a pair of laws passed in the red states of Florida and Texas over [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=150.48s)]
*  the question of First Amendment rights on the Internet. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=156.68s)]
*  The Supreme Court is considering whether the platforms are like newspapers, which have [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=160.68s)]
*  free speech rights to make their own editorial decisions, or if they're more like telephone [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=165.82s)]
*  companies that merely transmit everyone's speech. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=171.98s)]
*  If the laws are upheld, the platforms could be forced to carry hate speech and false medical [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=176.98s)]
*  information, the very content most big tech companies have spent years trying to remove [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=183.66s)]
*  through teams of content moderators. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=190.34s)]
*  But in the process, conservatives claim that the companies have engaged in a conspiracy [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=194.06s)]
*  to suppress their speech. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  As in this case, a tweet in 2022 from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene falsely claiming that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=203.2s)]
*  there were extremely high amounts of COVID vaccine deaths. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=211.28s)]
*  I have not misled anyone. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=216.26s)]
*  I have not put out misinformation. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=217.86s)]
*  Twitter eventually banned Greene's personal account for multiple violations of its COVID [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=220.10000000000002s)]
*  policy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=226.5s)]
*  Facebook and YouTube also removed or labeled posts they deemed misinformation. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=228.10000000000002s)]
*  Big tech's out to get conservatives. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=234.58s)]
*  That's not a suspicion. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=236.74s)]
*  That's not a hunch. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=237.82000000000002s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=238.82000000000002s)]
*  Confronted with criticisms from conservatives like Congressman Jim Jordan that the social [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=239.82000000000002s)]
*  media companies were censoring their views and because of cost cutting, platforms began [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=245.22s)]
*  downsizing their fact-checking teams. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=251.54s)]
*  So today, social media is teeming with misinformation, like these posts suggesting tanks are moving [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  across the Texas-Mexico border. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=262.74s)]
*  But it's actually footage from Chile. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=265.68s)]
*  These are AI-generated images of, well, see for yourself. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=269.54s)]
*  With social media moderation teams shrinking, a new target is misinformation academic researchers [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=274.96s)]
*  who began working closely with the platforms after evidence of Russian interference online [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=282.76s)]
*  in the 2016 election. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=289.28s)]
*  Are researchers being chilled? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=291.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=293.96s)]
*  Kate Starbird is a professor at the University of Washington, a former professional basketball [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=294.96s)]
*  player and a leader of a misinformation research group created ahead of the 2020 election. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  We were very specifically looking at misinformation about election processes, procedures and election [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=308.88s)]
*  results. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=314.56s)]
*  And if we saw something about that, we would pass it along to the platforms if we thought [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=315.56s)]
*  it violated one of their policies. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=319.17999999999995s)]
*  Here's an example. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  A November 2020 tweet saying that election software in Michigan switched 6,000 votes [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=323.64s)]
*  from Trump to Biden. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=331.0s)]
*  The researchers alerted Twitter that then decided to label it with a warning. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=333.6s)]
*  I understand that some of the researchers, including you, have had some threats against [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=339.48s)]
*  them, death threats. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  I have received one. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=347.2s)]
*  Sometimes they're threats with something behind them and sometimes they're just there to make [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=349.24s)]
*  you nervous and uncomfortable and it's hard to know the difference. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=352.16s)]
*  This campaign against you is meant to discredit you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=355.88s)]
*  So we won't believe you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=360.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=361.56s)]
*  It's interesting that the people that pushed voter fraud lies are some of the same people [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=362.56s)]
*  that are trying to discredit researchers that are trying to understand the problem. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=366.48s)]
*  Did your research find that there was more misinformation spread by conservatives? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=370.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=377.52s)]
*  I think not just our research, research across the board looking at the 2020 election found [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  that there was more misinformation spread by people that were supporters of Donald Trump [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  or conservatives. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=389.52s)]
*  And the events of January 6 kind of underscore this. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=390.96s)]
*  The folks climbing up the Capitol building were supporters of Donald Trump and they were [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=396.79999999999995s)]
*  misinformed by these false claims and that motivated those actions. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=402.0s)]
*  This is wrong. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=406.7s)]
*  We know it's wrong and it's about protecting the First Amendment. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=407.7s)]
*  Ohio Republican Congressman Jim Jordan is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=410.62s)]
*  So how big a problem is mis and disinformation on the Web? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=416.86s)]
*  Well I'm sure there's some but I think our concern is the bigger problem of the attack [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=422.06s)]
*  on First Amendment liberties. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=427.65999999999997s)]
*  Congressman Jordan's Judiciary Committee produced a report that concluded there's a censorship [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=429.82s)]
*  industrial complex where the federal government and tech companies colluded with academic [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=435.78s)]
*  researchers to disproportionately silence conservatives, which Kate Starbird vigorously [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=441.9s)]
*  denies. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=448.58s)]
*  But Congressman Jordan says her group unfairly flagged posts like this tweet by Newt Gingrich. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=450.46s)]
*  Pennsylvania Democrats are methodically changing the rules so they can steal the election. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=457.53999999999996s)]
*  What I care about is the ability to speak and to speak in a political fashion and not [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=464.14s)]
*  have the government come after you for doing so. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=468.97999999999996s)]
*  He complains that government officials put pressure on social media companies directly. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=471.97999999999996s)]
*  A great example, 36 hours into the Biden administration, the Biden White House sends a email to Twitter [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=478.38s)]
*  and says we think you should take down this tweet ASAP. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=485.44s)]
*  Just a call alone from the government, he says, can be unnerving. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=489.78s)]
*  You can't have the government say, hey, we want you to do X, government who has the ability [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=494.2s)]
*  to regulate these private companies, government which has the ability to tax these private [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=499.21999999999997s)]
*  companies. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=502.94s)]
*  He says that White House email to Twitter involved a tweet from... [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=503.94s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and everything in the tweet was true. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=508.14s)]
*  That tweet implied falsely that baseball legend Hank Aaron's death was caused by the COVID [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=512.18s)]
*  vaccine. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=519.02s)]
*  Did they take it then? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=520.02s)]
*  Turned out they didn't. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=521.5s)]
*  Thank goodness. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=522.5s)]
*  And that post is still up. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=523.5s)]
*  Kate Starbird says the social media platforms also often ignored the researchers' suggestions. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=526.1s)]
*  The statistics I've seen are just for the Twitter platform, but my understanding is [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=533.26s)]
*  that they responded to about 30 percent of the things that we sent them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=537.14s)]

*  by 50 percent. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1090.94s)]
*  So what did you do between December and January that changed that number so dramatically? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1092.74s)]
*  We were more careful about our southern border. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1100.74s)]
*  We spoke with the presidents of Central America, with the president of Venezuela and with the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1103.5s)]
*  president of Cuba. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1108.54s)]
*  We asked them for help in curbing the flow of migrants. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1110.14s)]
*  However, that is a short term solution, not a long term one. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1113.18s)]
*  Mexico also increased patrols at the border, flying some migrants to the southern part [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1118.38s)]

*  Yes, because our relationship is very important. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1203.62s)]
*  It is fundamental. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1210.9s)]
*  For much of the last six years, President Lopez Obrador has held a televised 7 a.m. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1214.5s)]
*  press conference five days a week. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1220.1s)]
*  During our visit, he was dissecting fake news. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1222.52s)]
*  The briefing lasted more than two hours. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1225.46s)]
*  Is it a pulpit or is it a press conference? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1228.42s)]
*  It is a circular dialogue, even though my opponents say that I'm on a pulpit. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1232.0s)]
*  Time is the only luxury AMLO seems comfortable spending. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1238.8400000000001s)]
*  When he took office, he sold the presidential jet and his predecessor's fleet of bulletproof [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1242.76s)]
*  cars in favor of his Volkswagen. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1247.46s)]
*  He uses his daily briefings to rail against the elite and enemies real and perceived. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1251.1000000000001s)]
*  At times, it can feel like a political telenovela. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1256.62s)]
*  At a briefing last month, the president stunned the audience when he read the cell phone number [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1260.78s)]
*  of a New York Times reporter who was pursuing what he viewed as a critical story of him. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1265.3s)]
*  It looks like you were threatening that reporter. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1271.6599999999999s)]
*  I didn't do it with the intention of harming her. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1273.9399999999998s)]
*  She, like yourself, are public figures. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1277.26s)]
*  And I am as well. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1281.02s)]
*  But you know this is a dangerous place for reporters and you know that threats often [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1282.3799999999999s)]
*  come in texts and phones. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1287.26s)]
*  When you put her phone number up behind you, you realized what you were doing. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1289.26s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1294.02s)]
*  Well, what did you think you were doing? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1295.02s)]
*  It's a form of responding to a libel. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1297.84s)]
*  Imagine what it means for this reporter to write that the president of Mexico has connections [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1300.58s)]
*  with drug traffickers and without having any proof. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1306.02s)]
*  It's a vile slander. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1310.86s)]
*  So then why not just say it's not true? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1311.86s)]
*  Because libel, when it doesn't stain, it smears. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1314.6599999999999s)]
*  Lopez Obrador's bare-knuckle brawls with the press are in sharp contrast to the softer [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1318.54s)]
*  approach he's taken with drug cartels. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1323.5s)]
*  He dissolved the federal police and created a national guard to take over public security. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1327.02s)]
*  And he invested millions to create jobs for young people to escape the grip of the cartels. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1332.34s)]
*  According to the Mexican government, homicides have dropped almost 20 percent since he took [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1338.86s)]
*  office. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1343.4199999999998s)]
*  The president calls his approach hugs, not bullets. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1344.4199999999998s)]
*  How is that working out for Mexico? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1347.8999999999999s)]
*  Very well. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1350.6999999999998s)]
*  There are still 30,000 homicides in Mexico and very few of those are prosecuted. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1351.6999999999998s)]
*  So there's an idea that there's still lawlessness in Mexico. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1358.5s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1361.9399999999998s)]
*  Of course we prosecute them. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1362.9399999999998s)]
*  There's no impunity in Mexico. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1365.58s)]
*  They all get prosecuted. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1367.52s)]
*  It's a small percent. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1368.52s)]
*  More than before. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1371.24s)]
*  According to Mexico Evalia, a Mexican think tank, about five percent of the country's [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1372.8s)]
*  homicides are prosecuted. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1377.48s)]
*  And a study last year reported cartels have expanded their reach, employing an estimated [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1379.52s)]
*  175,000 people to extort businesses and traffic migrants and drugs into the U.S. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1385.56s)]
*  Can you reach the cartel and say, knock it off? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1393.0s)]
*  What you have to do with the criminals is apply the law. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1396.92s)]
*  But I'm not going to establish contact, communication with a criminal, the president of Mexico. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1399.76s)]
*  Are you saying you don't have to reach out to them or communicate with them? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1406.4s)]
*  Because you cannot negotiate with criminals. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1411.8000000000002s)]
*  The head of the DEA says cartels are mass producing fentanyl and the U.S. State Department [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1414.52s)]
*  has said that most of it is coming out of Mexico. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1420.6000000000001s)]
*  Are they wrong? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1424.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1426.24s)]
*  Or rather, they don't have all the information because fentanyl is also produced in the United [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1427.24s)]
*  States. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1433.6799999999998s)]
*  The State Department says most of it's coming from Mexico. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1434.6799999999998s)]
*  Fentanyl is produced in the United States, in Canada and in Mexico. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1438.56s)]
*  And the chemical precursors come from Asia. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1443.0s)]
*  You know why we don't have the drug consumption that you have in the United States? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1446.84s)]
*  Because we have customs, traditions, and we don't have the problem of the disintegration [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1452.0s)]
*  of the family. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1457.36s)]
*  But there is drug consumption in Mexico. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1458.36s)]
*  But very little. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1460.84s)]
*  So why the violence then in Mexico? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1462.56s)]
*  Because drug trafficking exists, but not the consumption. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1466.36s)]
*  Lopez Obrador says threats by U.S. lawmakers to shut down the border to curb drug trafficking [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1471.4s)]
*  is little more than saber rattling. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1477.56s)]
*  That's because last year, Mexico became America's top trading partner. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1480.28s)]
*  They could say, we are going to close the border, but we mutually need each other. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1485.48s)]
*  What would happen to the U.S. if they closed the border? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1490.36s)]
*  You would not be able to buy inexpensive cars if the border is closed. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1493.0s)]
*  That is, you would have to pay $10,000, $15,000 more for a car. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1497.6s)]
*  There are factories in Mexico and there are factories in the United States that are fundamental [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1505.28s)]
*  for all the consumers in the United States and all the consumers in Mexico. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1510.3999999999999s)]
*  Last year, the Mexican economy grew 3 percent, and unemployment hit a record low. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1516.56s)]
*  But critics say Mexico's economic growth isn't because of the president, rather in spite [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1522.0s)]
*  of him. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1527.28s)]
*  Lopez Obrador directed billions to signature mega-projects like an oil refinery in his [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1528.28s)]
*  home state and a railroad through the Yucatan jungle, costing an estimated $28 billion. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1533.56s)]
*  What about infrastructure? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1541.6399999999999s)]
*  Aren't there more dire concerns, like clean water, roads, reliable energy, when you're [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1543.2s)]
*  trying to attract business to Mexico? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1548.36s)]
*  We're doing both, fixing the roads and building this train. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1551.84s)]
*  It will link all the ancient Mayan cities and is going to allow Mexicans and tourists [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1557.76s)]
*  to enjoy a paradise region that is the southeast of Mexico. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1563.52s)]
*  Lopez Obrador has spent unapologetically on social programs, doubling the minimum wage, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1568.72s)]
*  increasing pensions and scholarships. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1575.48s)]
*  His approval rating has remained high, upwards of 60 percent for most of his presidency. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1577.72s)]
*  Your critics say that you're popular because you give people money. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1583.74s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=1587.78s)]

*  than the United States Navy has. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfTxZi2mgw&t=2326.2s)]
