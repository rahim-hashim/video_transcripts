# Tim Donaghy: The ref who bet on NBA games; Legal sports betting hits U.S. | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [May 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw)
*  Tim Donaghy was at the top of his game. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=0.0s)]
*  A referee in the National Basketball Association, he loved the limelight, was considered one [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=16.56s)]
*  of the NBA's better refs, and was making almost $300,000 a year. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=22.12s)]
*  But he was also living a secret life. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=28.36s)]
*  During the last four years of his 13-year career, he committed a personal foul. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=31.0s)]
*  He betrayed the fans and the league by betting on NBA games, including some he was officiating. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=36.7s)]
*  Donaghy won about 75% of his bets, an incredible percentage confirmed by the FBI. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=44.32s)]
*  Tonight, Tim Donaghy speaks out publicly for the first time, telling us why he bet on NBA [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=51.44s)]
*  games, how he won so often, and how his world collapsed. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=57.44s)]
*  And what a world it was. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  It was your dream job. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=64.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=66.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=67.36s)]
*  I think I had an opportunity to run up and down the floor with the greatest athletes [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=68.36s)]
*  in the world. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=71.78s)]
*  I just loved the game of basketball. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=72.78s)]
*  Growing up, my goal was to somehow be a part of it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=74.44s)]
*  So everything was going just fine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=77.72s)]
*  It was a dream situation all around. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=78.96s)]
*  And then you committed the Cardinal sin. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=81.08s)]
*  You started betting on NBA games, including games that you were reffing yourself. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=82.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=87.28s)]
*  What were you thinking? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=88.28s)]
*  Obviously, I wasn't thinking to cross that line. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=89.28s)]
*  Why do you think you did it? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=93.36s)]
*  Because I fell into an addiction of gambling. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=94.76s)]
*  How did it begin? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  Playing golf at country clubs and card games and country clubs and people's houses. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=98.64s)]
*  And it just evolved from those types of situations to betting on athletic contests. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=105.16s)]
*  From card games to athletic contests to the NBA. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=111.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=115.24s)]
*  Donaghy was betraying everything he and his family stood for. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=116.24s)]
*  His father had been a respected ref in college basketball. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Tim followed in his footsteps and went even further, making it to the NBA. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  But Tim said betting was more powerful than all of that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=130.28s)]
*  And winning was ecstasy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=133.96s)]
*  And did betting on the NBA give you a higher high than betting on other sports? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=137.34s)]
*  I think it gave me a higher high because I was able to predict the outcome of the games. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=142.18s)]
*  And I think when you talk about gambling and the euphoria that comes with it, making winning [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=148.06s)]
*  picks is what excites you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=154.36s)]
*  Euphoria. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=156.74s)]
*  Real euphoria. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=157.94s)]
*  And as far as you know, you were the only ref who was placing bets? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=160.7s)]
*  As far as I understand, yes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=164.62s)]
*  How many games did you bet on? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=166.38s)]
*  I think I bet on probably over 100 games. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=167.98s)]
*  Over 100. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=170.26s)]
*  And how many of those were you reffing yourself? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=171.38s)]
*  A lot. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=174.26s)]
*  And here's what you may find difficult to believe. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=175.74s)]
*  Donaghy says that while his betting may have been illegal, his reffing was always honest. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=178.5s)]
*  You're insisting that your betting did not influence the way you called a game. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=184.34s)]
*  Why should we believe you? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=190.7s)]
*  Because the FBI did a thorough investigation and even the NBA concluded that I did not [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=192.2s)]
*  fix games in the NBA. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=198.11999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=200.32s)]
*  A 29-year FBI veteran, Special Agent Philip Scala, led the investigation of Donaghy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=201.32s)]
*  He told us that Donaghy convinced him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  He said, knowing the information that I had, I didn't have to do anything on the court [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=210.0s)]
*  to pick a winner. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=216.78s)]
*  I could pick a winner 80% of the time just knowing what I knew an hour before the game. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=219.36s)]
*  And watching the tapes, we could see that there was never something outlandish where [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  you could see he called a foul or he omitted a foul because he wanted to see certain team [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=232.6s)]
*  win. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=239.84s)]
*  We never saw that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=240.84s)]
*  The NBA's investigation came to the same surprising conclusion. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=241.84s)]
*  Quote, it seems plausible to us that Donaghy may not have manipulated games. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=245.6s)]
*  We are unable to contradict the government's conclusion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=250.88s)]
*  When you were reffing a game, didn't it come to your mind that you'd bet on one team and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=255.24s)]
*  not on the other? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=259.68s)]
*  I tried to put it out of my mind and I think that I was able to do that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=260.8s)]
*  In one game you were betting on San Antonio, but you threw their coach, Greg Popovich, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=265.08s)]
*  out of the game. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=270.04s)]
*  And now, Greg Popovich has been tossed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=271.04s)]
*  I didn't think about the bet during the game and in my mind he needed to be ejected. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  Losing their coach cost San Antonio the game and cost Donaghy his bet. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=279.24s)]
*  But that didn't happen very often. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=283.76s)]
*  Donaghy claims, and the FBI concurs, that he won 70 to 80% of his NBA bets. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=285.88s)]
*  You told the FBI, this is a quote, you don't realize how easy this was for me knowing what [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=298.32s)]
*  What exactly did you know? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=300.52s)]
*  I knew that there were certain relationships that existed between referees and players, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=302.28s)]
*  referees and coaches, and referees and owners that influenced the point spreads in games. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=307.23999999999995s)]
*  What's a point spread? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=314.76s)]
*  A point spread is where a team is favored to win or lose by a certain amount of points. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=315.76s)]
*  You say that certain refs like or dislike certain players, certain coaches, certain [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=321.32s)]
*  general managers? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=328.61999999999995s)]
*  Certain owners. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=331.28s)]
*  You told us, I knew these guys, I knew who they liked, who they despised, and who they [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=332.96s)]
*  would help or screw over. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=338.08s)]
*  For example, Donaghy cited tempestuous superstar Allen Iverson. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=340.28s)]
*  Some refs liked him, some did not. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=345.11999999999995s)]
*  Natural enough. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=347.44s)]
*  But Donaghy said several refs would let their feelings influence their calls by either favoring [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=348.44s)]
*  Iverson or favoring his opponents. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=353.91999999999996s)]
*  And that would affect the score. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=356.52s)]
*  And I knew those relationships, whether they were positive or negative, had an effect on [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=359.04s)]
*  the game. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  So you knew when Iverson was playing and you knew which refs were there, you knew whether [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  to bet on the Iverson team or on the other team? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=370.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  Iverson wouldn't talk to us. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  He didn't want refs to get mad at him. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  But his manager told us that the way the refs were treating him, some for, some against, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=377.44s)]
*  made him sick. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=383.20000000000005s)]
*  I do believe Allen Iverson knew this. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  And I believe all the players know this, that certain referees treat them much better than [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=386.32s)]
*  others. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=391.08s)]
*  Donaghy told us that two years ago, Iverson had incurred the wrath of the refs. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=392.08s)]
*  He had threatened one of our officials and the NBA fined him $25,000. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  And we felt as a group that he should have been suspended. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=403.88s)]
*  And because he wasn't, we felt like we would teach him a lesson. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=407.06s)]
*  During that time you worked an Iverson game in January 6, 2007. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=411.28s)]
*  So you bet against Iverson's team. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=415.52s)]
*  Correct. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=417.48s)]
*  Because you knew that all the refs that were gunning for him, this was openly discussed? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=418.48s)]
*  Openly discussed. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=422.6s)]
*  And I knew that the other two referees and I sought out to do a little justice of our [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=423.68s)]
*  own. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=430.36s)]
*  The refs quickly called curious fouls on Iverson, including rarely called fouls for palming. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=431.36s)]
*  And Iverson still upset about that palming call. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=437.76s)]
*  They threw his game off and his team lost. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=441.76s)]
*  According to the game's announcers, even late in the game, you kept hurting Iverson's [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=444.88s)]
*  team by letting defenders bludgeon him without calling any fouls. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=449.4s)]
*  Watch. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=453.24s)]
*  What are we looking at? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=464.24s)]
*  We're looking at a foul that was let go. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=465.56s)]
*  Obviously, in the pregame meetings, we came to the conclusion that we were not going to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=467.88s)]
*  give Allen Iverson any marginal plays to the basket. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=472.96s)]
*  And that absolutely should have been called a foul that I and the other referees passed on. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=477.44s)]
*  Did anyone in the NBA know about it? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=483.28s)]
*  There was a group supervisor at the game that came in at halftime who was laughing and stated [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=484.92s)]
*  that he felt that Iverson had gotten the message. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=490.36s)]
*  So the supervisor approved of your punishing Iverson? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=493.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  The NBA would not let that supervisor or any of its refs talk to us. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=499.72s)]
*  In that game, Donaghy did make calls that helped him win his bet. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=504.56s)]
*  But he insists that wasn't the point. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=508.8s)]
*  He says all he wanted to do was punish Iverson. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=511.52000000000004s)]
*  But yes, he did win his bet. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=515.0s)]
*  Special agent Philip Scala, who retired from the FBI last year, told us Donaghy would bet [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=517.72s)]
*  on a game when he knew who the refs were and that they felt strongly about certain players. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=523.0s)]
*  What does that tell you about how certain refs call games? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=529.12s)]
*  Most of the refs we believed were honest in calling the game as they had seen it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=532.24s)]
*  There was this aspect of judgment. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=540.76s)]
*  A person should understand his bias and make sure he leaves that on the sideline. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=543.84s)]
*  But obviously that wasn't the case or else Donaghy wouldn't have been picking 80% of the games. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=549.68s)]
*  There seemed to be some bleeding in that area. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=555.4s)]
*  Some bleeding sounds to me like an understatement. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=558.88s)]
*  It could be. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=561.3599999999999s)]
*  Now you say that Donaghy cooperated with you. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=563.04s)]
*  If he had lied to you, he would have faced a much longer sentence, no? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=565.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=570.52s)]
*  So long as he was completely honest and omitted nothing, the FBI would stand by him if we [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=571.52s)]
*  ever found out that there was a lie, that cooperation agreement would be ripped up. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=578.52s)]
*  And that never happened? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=582.68s)]
*  That never happened. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=584.0s)]
*  Donaghy told the FBI and us that NBA headquarters inadvertently helped him pick winners by sending [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=585.36s)]
*  refs instructions before a game. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=592.64s)]
*  For example, he says he won several bets in a row by putting his money on the Los Angeles [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=595.42s)]
*  Lakers because he knew the league was going to favor their star Kobe Bryant. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=600.92s)]
*  He knew it because the Lakers had complained that refs had missed calling fouls on defenders [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=606.68s)]
*  who'd been blocking Bryant. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=612.4s)]
*  The Lakers had sent in a CD of 25 plays that they felt calls were missed when Kobe Bryant [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  went to the basket. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=623.76s)]
*  And I understood from the NBA office that 22 of those plays were missed by the referees. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=625.4s)]
*  I knew that Kobe Bryant was basically going to be given the opportunity to go to the foul [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=631.48s)]
*  line of somebody as much as breathe on him. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=637.16s)]
*  The NBA says its instructions to refs are meant to improve officiating. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=640.16s)]
*  But Donaghy says those directives made it easy for him to pick winners. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=645.28s)]
*  Because it was inside information along the lines of knowing that a certain stock was [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=650.0s)]
*  going to be bought out before the opening bell on the stock market. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=654.48s)]
*  So it's almost a guarantee. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=659.84s)]
*  Here's more of what you did. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=663.8000000000001s)]
*  You had telephone refs who were about to officiate a game and pumped them for information before [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=665.0s)]
*  the game. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=670.26s)]
*  What kind of information were you looking for? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=671.82s)]
*  If there was a situation where there was a payback in order from a previous game. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=673.5600000000001s)]
*  Injuries? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=678.24s)]
*  Injuries certainly played a factor of just little gossip conversations that I would use [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=679.24s)]
*  in making a pick. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=684.08s)]
*  But the other refs did not know that you were using this information to place bets? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=685.2800000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=689.56s)]
*  So you were betraying your fellow referees? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=690.56s)]
*  Unfortunately yes. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=693.3199999999999s)]
*  One former ref who feels betrayed is Mike Mathis who used to head the Referees Union. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=695.88s)]
*  He told us that refs speak openly among themselves about their personal prejudices. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=701.3599999999999s)]
*  In locker rooms, okay, referees do talk about players. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=707.4799999999999s)]
*  You know if a guy is sitting there saying he don't like so and so and this guy does [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=711.68s)]
*  and he won't keep his mouth shut, da da da da da, I can see where he could take that [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=715.52s)]
*  information and use it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=719.92s)]
*  But Mathis says he was stunned that Donaghy actually did use it to place bets. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=721.64s)]
*  What do you think of what Donaghy did? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=726.92s)]
*  It's reprehensible. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=728.68s)]
*  It took a career of mine 25 years and sort of washed it down the toilet. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=732.38s)]
*  So Donaghy really spoiled the reputation of all of you guys? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=738.12s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=743.16s)]
*  Mike Mathis is a man you respect, right? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=744.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=747.16s)]
*  Mathis said your betting on NBA games was reprehensible. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=748.16s)]
*  You agree? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=752.5600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=753.5600000000001s)]
*  But did you feel that you were doing something wrong? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  Sure, but obviously it was easy and it was exciting and I actually didn't realize the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=758.0s)]
*  consequences of my actions. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=763.84s)]
*  You didn't know that you were doing something that could get you into trouble? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=765.8000000000001s)]
*  Obviously it was in the back of my head, but I think you just go with the notion that [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=770.76s)]
*  you're not going to be caught. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=775.12s)]
*  You thought you could get away with it? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=776.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=778.2s)]
*  And Donaghy might well have gotten away with it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=779.2s)]
*  He might still be reffing and betting today, but he fell in with the mob. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=782.08s)]
*  How the mob brought him down when we come back. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=786.64s)]
*  Tim Donaghy, the NBA ref who bet on games he officiated, was placing those bets through [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=799.92s)]
*  a friend. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=805.1999999999999s)]
*  He was too scared of getting caught to do it himself. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=806.1999999999999s)]
*  And their winning streak went on uninterrupted for three years. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=809.5999999999999s)]
*  But in the fourth year, that friend let slip that he was getting his betting tips from [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=813.24s)]
*  an NBA ref. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=818.06s)]
*  The mob found out about it and wanted in on the action. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=819.8s)]
*  That's when Donaghy discovered what it means to be really scared. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=823.7199999999999s)]
*  It started outside this hotel in Philadelphia. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=830.52s)]
*  The FBI says two men associated with the Gambino crime family requested a meeting with Donaghy. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=832.64s)]
*  They took him for a ride. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=839.5600000000001s)]
*  They came down and picked me up. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=841.44s)]
*  They picked you up? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=843.2s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=844.2s)]
*  And what happened then? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=845.2s)]
*  They basically told me that I needed to give them the picks. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=846.8000000000001s)]
*  And if I didn't, that it's a possibility that somebody would go down and visit my wife and [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=850.38s)]
*  kids in Florida. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=856.14s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=857.64s)]
*  And you believed them? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=858.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=861.24s)]
*  Were you scared? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=862.24s)]
*  Sure. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=864.24s)]
*  From then on, his picks were relayed to the mob. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=865.68s)]
*  And how did you communicate your bets? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=869.1999999999999s)]
*  I would discuss it with a high school friend of mine who would pass the information along [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=872.64s)]
*  to them. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  And was there a code? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=878.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=879.68s)]
*  The code was if I wanted them to bet the home team, I would discuss his brother Chuck, and [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=880.68s)]
*  if I wanted him to bet the visiting team, I would mention his brother Johnny. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=886.64s)]
*  Do you have any notion how much the mob made off of Donaghy? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=890.36s)]
*  The FBI is very, very conservative in those aspects. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=895.0s)]
*  We felt comfortable saying it was at least a few million dollars, conservatively, that [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=898.6800000000001s)]
*  went into the coffers of organized crime. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=904.52s)]
*  And how much were you making? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=907.62s)]
*  I was making $2,000 per correct pick. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=909.48s)]
*  $2,000 per correct pick? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=912.6s)]
*  It seems like peanuts if they were making millions. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=915.76s)]
*  It was. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=918.2s)]
*  Why didn't you ask for more money? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=919.2s)]
*  It wasn't about the money at that point. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=921.8s)]
*  It wasn't about the money? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=923.56s)]
*  It was just about getting through the season and hoping that it ended. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=925.0s)]
*  Because the mob put a lot of money on his picks, they were not good losers. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=928.84s)]
*  We told you that in one game, Donaghy threw out the coach of the team they were betting [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=932.88s)]
*  on. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=936.72s)]
*  That cost the mob the bet. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=937.72s)]
*  And they were not happy. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=939.64s)]
*  They had questions as to why I did it. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=941.28s)]
*  And what did you tell them? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=943.84s)]
*  I just told them that I wasn't making calls in games to influence the outcome. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=944.9200000000001s)]
*  And I'm not going to be able to obviously predict the winner every night. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=950.76s)]
*  And they have to accept that that's what's going to happen. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=956.12s)]
*  Did the mob accept that? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=958.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure that they accepted it or not, but that was the information that I passed [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=960.0400000000001s)]
*  to them. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=963.88s)]
*  As it turned out, his mob connection brought him down. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=964.88s)]
*  The FBI, which was monitoring mob phone calls, heard that an NBA ref was betting on games. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=968.1600000000001s)]
*  The information made it to Special Agent Philip Scala, who headed the FBI's Gambino Family [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=974.72s)]
*  Task Force. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=980.1999999999999s)]
*  One of the case agents had come into my office and said that they had information from a [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=981.8s)]
*  wiretap stating that there was huge sums of money being made and that someone thought [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=986.76s)]
*  that a ref may be involved. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=995.12s)]
*  So you got to Donaghy through the mob, really? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=996.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=999.76s)]
*  So if you hadn't gotten involved with a mob, you might still be out there, refing and betting [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1001.0799999999999s)]
*  on your own games. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1005.5799999999999s)]
*  Possibly. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1007.12s)]
*  So you're a big mistake for getting involved with a mob. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1008.5999999999999s)]
*  No, my big mistake was crossing that line and where I bet in the first place. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1011.5999999999999s)]
*  Tell me about the moment that you realized that the FBI knew that you'd be betting on [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1018.1999999999999s)]
*  NBA games. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1022.9s)]
*  A sickening feeling. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1024.6399999999999s)]
*  The realization of that happening was just sickening. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1027.36s)]
*  Once you were caught, you decided to come clean and cooperate. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1031.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  I knew I did something that was obviously a bad choice and I decided that moving forward [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1035.1599999999999s)]
*  it was not only in my best interest but my family's best interest to try and cut my losses. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1042.56s)]
*  You call it a bad choice. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1049.28s)]
*  Isn't that something of an understatement? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1050.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1052.32s)]
*  It was a horrible choice. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1053.32s)]
*  He cooperated with the FBI to get a lighter sentence but that exposed him to some dark problems. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1055.96s)]
*  Were you contacted by anyone in the mob? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1062.3600000000001s)]
*  There were threats made to my home phone. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1064.8400000000001s)]
*  What kind of threats did you receive? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1068.48s)]
*  Death threats. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1070.3600000000001s)]
*  What did they say? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1071.3600000000001s)]
*  That I was going to be killed. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1073.52s)]
*  Did you believe him? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1076.08s)]
*  I wasn't sure. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1078.6000000000001s)]
*  Donaghy was sentenced to one year in prison where he found he was not safe from the mob. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1080.88s)]
*  He was threatened then attacked. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1085.8000000000002s)]
*  There was one guy who claimed that he was associated with the mob and that he was going [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1088.44s)]
*  to get a gun and eventually blow my head off and break my knee caps. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1093.0800000000002s)]
*  His head was untouched but months later one knee still needs therapy. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1098.5800000000002s)]
*  He whacked me with a stick and did some damage to my knee. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1103.1200000000001s)]
*  And now that he's out, he is still worried about retribution from the mob. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1107.56s)]
*  Well certainly it's in the back of my mind but I'm not going to live my life in fear. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1111.92s)]
*  I was informed by the FBI agents that they certainly had an eye on what they called these [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1117.36s)]
*  wise guys and that if anything would come up they would inform me immediately. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1122.74s)]
*  Do you believe that you will be protected? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1127.28s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1129.28s)]
*  Convicted of wire fraud and passing betting tips across state lines, Donaghy spent 11 [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1131.2s)]
*  months of his sentence in prison and was released last month. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1136.48s)]
*  He could well have been sentenced to more than five years if he hadn't cooperated. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1140.0s)]
*  His two mob cohorts, Thomas the Doctor Martino and James the Sheep Batista, denied ever threatening [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1144.3600000000001s)]
*  Donaghy and got sentences of 15 months and one year. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1151.8600000000001s)]
*  Donaghy not only confessed his own sins to the FBI, he also blew the whistle on the NBA. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1156.92s)]
*  He claimed that in the playoffs the NBA does everything possible to extend series and [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1163.26s)]
*  to help big market teams advance. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1168.98s)]
*  Longer playoffs with those chosen teams mean more money for the NBA. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1171.82s)]
*  The NBA denies it and says Donaghy was making wild allegations hoping to reduce his sentence. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1177.22s)]
*  Commissioner David Stern declined to speak with us. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1184.18s)]
*  He didn't want the league to participate in a report about Donaghy. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1186.74s)]
*  NBA Commissioner David Stern and other referees say that you have no credibility. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1190.78s)]
*  You are a convicted felon not to be trusted. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1195.42s)]
*  They say refs are professional and all this stuff about their personal feelings influencing [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1198.66s)]
*  the way they call games is nonsense. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1203.46s)]
*  I would say they have a very valid point, but I would again point back to the investigation [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1206.58s)]
*  that the FBI conducted and the fact that I was 100 percent truthful with them. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1210.7s)]
*  The FBI said that they believed you, that you were honest, but that does not necessarily [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1217.14s)]
*  mean that you're correct. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1222.0s)]
*  You may have believed the NBA was tilting the playing field, but that doesn't mean that [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1223.46s)]
*  they actually did so. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1228.46s)]
*  I would answer that with the fact that I was still able to pick the games at a 70 to 80 [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1230.5s)]
*  percent correct rate. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1234.94s)]
*  How much do you think you made in total? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1236.42s)]
*  Over the course of four years betting on NBA games I think I probably profited around [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1238.14s)]
*  $100,000. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1244.14s)]
*  Where's that money today? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1245.14s)]
*  Some of it's at casinos, some of it's paid off football debts, some of it's paid off [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1247.3400000000001s)]
*  luxury items for our house. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1254.0600000000002s)]
*  Now Donaghy has written a book titled Personal Foul, published by the VTI Group after Random [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1256.66s)]
*  House dropped it. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1262.38s)]
*  It's about his betting scandal and his allegations against the NBA, but the league is striking [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1263.8600000000001s)]
*  back. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1269.8600000000001s)]
*  They keep trying to paint me as the rogue referee. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1270.8600000000001s)]
*  We think we have here a rogue, isolated criminal. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1273.72s)]
*  Aren't you the rogue referee? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1278.84s)]
*  I mean I certainly made some terrible choices to do what I did, but the culture that existed [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1280.52s)]
*  within the game of the NBA enabled me to be able to do this at a very successful rate. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1285.96s)]
*  You said that to you basketball represented discipline, tradition, fairness, and integrity. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1292.28s)]
*  You betrayed all of that, didn't you? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1299.04s)]
*  Yes I did. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1300.72s)]
*  Have you learned to live with yourself? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1302.06s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1303.52s)]
*  But you brought it on yourself. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1304.52s)]
*  I certainly did. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1307.12s)]
*  What is the moral of your story? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1309.6s)]

*  We all have choices to make in life and when we decide to go down that wrong road, it'd [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1315.24s)]
*  be better off backing up and realizing that not only do you affect your life with some [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1322.6599999999999s)]
*  terrible choices, but the lives of people you love the most and that's your family. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1328.5s)]
*  How did it affect your family? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1333.82s)]
*  Rowan did. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1337.78s)]

*  Ironically, Donaghy says his scandal has actually improved NBA officiating because the league [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1343.1s)]
*  has made various changes to prevent refs from letting their biases influence their calls. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1349.08s)]
*  Are you still watching basketball? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1354.3s)]
*  I haven't watched a game in two years. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1356.84s)]
*  You were involved in it for how many years? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1359.76s)]

*  I would wish that I was out on the floor refereeing it. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1369.72s)]
*  And that's something that you'll never do again? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1373.56s)]
*  No. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1375.76s)]
*  Yes, our March Madness brackets are already a mess too. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1387.78s)]
*  But here's one safe prediction for the 2019 NCAA basketball tournament that tipped off [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1392.24s)]
*  this week. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1397.28s)]
*  It will feature more wagering than ever before. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1398.46s)]
*  That's because last year the Supreme Court overturned a federal law and ruled that it [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1401.68s)]
*  is up to the states to decide whether they want to legalize sports gambling. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1406.32s)]
*  New Jersey led the way, many more followed, and more are planning too soon. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1411.28s)]
*  This shift will bring a windfall to bookmakers, sports leagues, and states' tax revenues. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1416.4s)]
*  But at what cost? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1421.98s)]
*  This is the first year of widely legalized sports gambling, but 2019 also marks another [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1423.6200000000001s)]
*  milestone. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1429.1000000000001s)]

*  16 games in one day and another 16 on tap the net. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1455.2800000000002s)]
*  Oh! The Euro! Major highlight! [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1459.24s)]
*  Super teams, Cinderella's, and nail-biting finishes. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1462.8400000000001s)]
*  Queen, quarter three at the buzzer! [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1466.8400000000001s)]
*  Hairball! And Auburn hangs on! [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1468.72s)]
*  But for all the familiar trappings, this year brought a new wrinkle. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1472.26s)]
*  Hit it, baby! [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1475.98s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1477.98s)]
*  On Thursday, gamblers thronged FanDuel's New Jersey Sportsbook. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1479.78s)]
*  Think of a sports bar where you can bet on anything. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1484.22s)]
*  People also put money down on total points scored, which highly-seated team will lose [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1488.66s)]
*  soonest, even whether a team with a tiger mascot will make the final four. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1493.8600000000001s)]
*  Some wagers were made with a clerk at a betting window. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1501.06s)]
*  More were made on mobile phone apps with just a tap and a swipe. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1504.12s)]
*  And some of those bets were made on games as they were being played. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1508.52s)]
*  It's estimated that March Madness generated $10 billion in gambling last year. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1513.52s)]
*  Yes, 10 billion. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1518.6799999999998s)]
*  Virtually all of it through illegal bookies or offshore websites. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1520.3999999999999s)]
*  You have an event like the NCAA tournament, one of the most wagered-upon sports events [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1524.52s)]
*  of the year. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1528.08s)]
*  You've got to think, more money is going to be wagered this year than ever before. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1529.1s)]
*  The amount that we can measure will certainly be much larger. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1532.54s)]
*  Ryan Rodenberg is a law professor at Florida State with a specialty in sports gambling. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1536.3799999999999s)]
*  Make like a bookmaker, set a line. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1541.78s)]
*  By the end of the year, how many states have some form of legalized sports gambling? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1543.58s)]
*  By the end of the year, there will be 15 states that have some form of sports betting and [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1547.1799999999998s)]
*  probably a dozen more that have passed a law but just haven't put it into effect yet. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1551.98s)]
*  So by 2020, more than half the states will have some form of legalized sports gambling. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1556.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1560.68s)]
*  And as legalized gambling spreads across the country, Rodenberg says unpaid college athletes [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1561.68s)]
*  are ripe targets for unscrupulous bettors. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1568.28s)]
*  The typical situation in terms of bribing someone to shave some points, you just don't [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1571.48s)]
*  see that at the high level, professional level. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1576.8799999999999s)]
*  But the one area where you do see it, and there's countless examples, is in college [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1580.6s)]
*  sports, particularly college basketball. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1584.6399999999999s)]
*  There's people that will do what they need to do to make a buck at the expense of an [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1587.94s)]
*  18 or 19-year-old kid. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1595.6399999999999s)]

*  states to legalize sports gambling after the Supreme Court ruling. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1603.6399999999999s)]
*  You can give your athletes tuition, scholarship, room and board, but you can't pay them. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1607.6399999999999s)]
*  If someone comes along and says here's $1,000, $2,000, $5,000 to corrupt a game, they're [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1612.9399999999998s)]
*  susceptible, you're saying. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1619.34s)]
*  It's very tempting. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1620.74s)]
*  It's very tempting. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1622.6399999999999s)]
*  It's not like gambling on sports hasn't existed before. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1623.6399999999999s)]
*  Why are you so nervous this year as opposed to last year? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1626.84s)]
*  It's right in front of my face, John. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1630.24s)]
*  It's illegal. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1632.54s)]
*  Hey, what's up, man? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1633.54s)]
*  Hamrick made it clear that his worry is far from isolated. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1635.24s)]
*  Most athletic directors that I've spoken with feel the same way. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1639.04s)]
*  It's like, oh no, it's here. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1643.34s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1645.84s)]
*  Before coming to Marshall, Hamrick was athletic director at UNLV, the University of Nevada, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1647.6399999999999s)]
*  Las Vegas. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1653.04s)]
*  At the time, the one place in America where sports gambling was legal. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1654.54s)]
*  Right after he took the job there, Hamrick went to a home basketball game. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1659.74s)]
*  UNLV was winning by what he thought was a comfortable margin. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1663.84s)]
*  The game was almost over. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1667.84s)]
*  One of our players had a wide open layup and didn't take it. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1669.24s)]
*  The game's over and the fans booed. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1672.84s)]
*  Fans booed? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1674.84s)]
*  Fans booed. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1675.84s)]
*  My wife looked at me and said, this is really going to be a difficult job. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1676.84s)]
*  We beat this team as bad as we did. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1681.28s)]
*  The fans want us to beat them worse. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1683.76s)]
*  I said, I don't know. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1686.24s)]
*  The guy beside me who was with me at the game said, that's not why the fans are unhappy. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1687.9599999999998s)]
*  They're unhappy that if this young man would have made that layup, UNLV would have covered [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1692.0s)]
*  the point spread. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1697.24s)]
*  So right then, I said to myself, this is something we've got to keep an eye on. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1698.24s)]
*  By now, he's had to build an entire infrastructure, adding staff to monitor and protect his athletes. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1703.84s)]
*  They can be compromised. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1710.92s)]
*  Our job is to make sure they're not compromised. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1712.68s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1715.72s)]
*  You educate them. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1716.72s)]
*  You see a key player on your team driving a brand new car. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1717.72s)]
*  You've got to find out where that car came from. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1722.48s)]
*  It isn't just gamblers trying to pay off players that Hamrick worries about. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1725.74s)]
*  It's also gamblers seeking insider tip-offs from players and staff, particularly about [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1730.22s)]
*  injuries. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1735.38s)]
*  That seems like a big challenge to keep those people from your players. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1736.7s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1740.18s)]
*  And that little bit of information could make a big difference. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1741.18s)]
*  I met with all our medical staff and absolutely no information's out there on injury. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1744.74s)]
*  Period. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1751.74s)]
*  You don't tell your wives, you don't tell your brother-in-laws, you don't tell anybody. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1752.74s)]
*  The talk of injuries and their impact on betting lines is still everywhere. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1757.06s)]
*  You can't follow sports these days without hearing about picks and odds and who's fit [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1765.78s)]
*  to play and who's not. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1772.94s)]
*  We hope everyone had a lovely Thanksgiving of wagering. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1775.16s)]
*  It hasn't happened overnight, but gambling, long seen as a vice best kept at arm's length, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1778.26s)]
*  is now embraced in popular culture. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1784.7s)]
*  I love gambling. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1787.06s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1788.06s)]
*  Ryan Rodenberg, the law professor, stresses that this is a huge shift from the days when [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1791.06s)]
*  every network and every sports league wanted nothing to do with sports gambling. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1796.3600000000001s)]
*  For decades it was, this could corrupt our product, this is going to pollute competition [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1801.14s)]
*  and we can't have this. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1806.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1807.78s)]
*  And that was the consistent message that they said both in court and on Capitol Hill that [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1808.78s)]
*  they needed to keep sports betting illegal. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1812.58s)]
*  But as soon as the Supreme Court freed states to legalize sports betting last May, the pro [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1817.26s)]
*  leagues immediately reversed course. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1822.3s)]
*  In sports terms, they transitioned from defense to offense. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1825.02s)]
*  MGM resource will be the NBA's first official gaming partner. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1828.82s)]
*  Within months of the ruling, the NBA, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1834.1799999999998s)]
*  all made deals with MGM. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1838.94s)]
*  And the NFL partnered up with Caesar's Palace. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1841.46s)]
*  It's amazing how quickly the landscape has shifted. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1844.58s)]
*  Joe Asher is the U.S. CEO of William Hill, a British based company that runs the biggest [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1848.74s)]
*  sports gambling operation in Nevada. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1854.1s)]
*  And aspires to do the same in every state that legalizes. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1857.46s)]
*  It was about 15 years ago when the city of Las Vegas wanted to buy advertising on the [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1861.22s)]
*  Super Bowl. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1865.6200000000001s)]
*  And that commercial was turned down. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1867.02s)]
*  So to go from that to having the Oakland Raiders moving to Las Vegas in a stadium that's right [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1868.5800000000002s)]
*  behind Mandalay Bay is just a stunning shift. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1874.7s)]
*  High fives everywhere. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1878.46s)]
*  No surprise, it's a shift driven by dollars. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1880.14s)]
*  Recent research by the American Gaming Association found that, perhaps contrary to stereotype, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1884.02s)]
*  today's sports gamblers tend to be younger and wealthier and better educated than the [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1890.02s)]
*  population at large. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1894.58s)]
*  NBA Commissioner Adam Silver was one of the first leaders in mainstream sports to see [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1896.42s)]
*  the economic opportunity. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1901.26s)]
*  The data is clear that if somebody has a bet on a game, even a small bet, they're much [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1903.1s)]
*  more likely to engage in that match. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1908.84s)]
*  They're much more likely to watch it. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1911.1s)]
*  They're more likely to watch it for more minutes. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1913.5s)]
*  They're more likely to be interested in the participants and to follow the sport. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1916.08s)]
*  So there's no doubt there's a business component to this. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1920.56s)]
*  A huge part of that business will be what's called in-play wagering. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1923.56s)]
*  Hundreds of options to bet during games. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1928.0s)]
*  When you and I were kids, people bet an hour before the game or whenever and then waited [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1931.0s)]
*  for many hours for the game to be over. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1935.8799999999999s)]
*  Now people are betting constantly throughout a sports match. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1938.36s)]
*  They're betting on quarter scores. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1942.72s)]
*  They're betting on the amount of points a particular player will have in a quarter. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1944.76s)]
*  In some cases they're betting on free throws. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1948.9s)]
*  Want to know where legalized sports gambling in America is headed? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1951.92s)]
*  Look to professional soccer in Great Britain and Europe, where in-play betting has been [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1957.32s)]
*  stitched into the fabric of that culture for years. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1962.02s)]
*  Over there, the in-game, real-time betting, which is all technology enhanced, that's what [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1965.92s)]
*  the big deal is. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1971.6s)]
*  In Europe it's about 50 percent and here clearly it's growing rapidly and I think it'll continue [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1973.48s)]
*  to grow. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1978.3600000000001s)]
*  And in this brave new betting world, Adam Silver claims that legal gambling is much [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1981.3600000000001s)]
*  more likely to be on the up and up than the old way with the neighborhood bookie. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1986.34s)]
*  Make your case, why does legalized sports gambling, why do you think that decreases [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1991.28s)]
*  risk of corruption, not increases it? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1997.24s)]
*  I think it decreases risk dramatically because we have access to the betting information. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=1999.84s)]
*  I think when you have an underground business operating in the shadows, you have no idea [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2005.04s)]
*  what people are betting on your own events. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2010.44s)]
*  Because of technology, you can essentially get a fingerprint for every bet that's placed. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2013.22s)]
*  You can detect unusual and unnatural line movements, bets. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2018.06s)]
*  That technology can facilitate betting but it can also facilitate detection. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2021.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2025.32s)]
*  Proponents of legalized gambling say, listen, moving this into the sunlight is going to [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2026.32s)]
*  decrease risk, not increase it. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2031.1599999999999s)]
*  You don't buy that? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2034.0s)]
*  I don't buy that. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2035.0s)]
*  No. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2036.0s)]
*  What are they wrong? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2037.0s)]
*  It's gambling. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2038.72s)]
*  It can be handled to a certain extent but nobody can sit here and tell you that they [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2039.84s)]
*  can deal with this and be 100 percent clean. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2047.4399999999998s)]
*  They can't. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2051.68s)]
*  That's at least partly because technology makes gambling much more accessible to many [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2053.4s)]
*  more people. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2057.92s)]
*  In states where mobile betting is allowed, up to three quarters of all wagers are now [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2059.28s)]
*  made on phones. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2063.64s)]
*  Just download an app, which by the way can detect whether you're within state lines, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2065.36s)]
*  and start betting. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2069.96s)]
*  So you're even sitting in the crowd in a martial basketball game. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2070.96s)]
*  Take out your phone and you can bet on the game you are watching. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2075.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2079.44s)]
*  And the fact that people will bet on every detail of every game presents Mike Hamrick [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2080.64s)]
*  with one more reason to worry about how gamblers could corrupt college athletics. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2085.68s)]
*  If you were an 18, 19 year old person from a difficult background and you didn't have [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2090.44s)]
*  a lot and someone put their arm around you and said, hey, you know, don't want Marshall [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2096.04s)]
*  to lose tonight but if it gets late in the game and it's two touchdowns, you'll miss [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2101.68s)]
*  a tackle. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2108.7000000000003s)]
*  Drop a pass. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2110.54s)]
*  Fumble. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2111.9399999999996s)]
*  That can happen. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2112.9399999999996s)]
*  Must scare the hell out of you. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2113.9399999999996s)]
*  It does. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2115.66s)]
*  It does. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2116.66s)]
*  It scares Hamrick enough that he's giving the names of every one of his players and [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2117.66s)]
*  employees to every West Virginia casino and gambling operator to ensure that his people [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2123.22s)]
*  abide by the NCAA rules prohibiting any sports betting. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2129.06s)]
*  Now that it is legal, what it did for you is put pressure on you as an athlete. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2133.22s)]
*  Hamrick also regularly invites FBI agents to come to campus and speak to his athletes. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2138.7s)]
*  Don't get involved. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2144.46s)]
*  Walk away. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2146.06s)]
*  They have to understand that if they get tied up with the wrong people, there are bad things [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2147.1s)]
*  that can happen. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2153.1s)]
*  Scare us straight. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2154.5s)]
*  Well, I don't want to sit here and tell you we're going to try to scare our student athletes [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2155.5s)]
*  into not gambling, but we are. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXcIHi_Hw&t=2160.04s)]
