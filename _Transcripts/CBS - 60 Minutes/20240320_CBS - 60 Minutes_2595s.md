*  years. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=114.0s)]

*  Navalny, Putin's leading rival, who died last month in an Arctic prison camp. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  Putin has killed nearly all internal opposition to his unprovoked war in Ukraine, and yet [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=129.96s)]
*  many courageous Russians continue the struggle outside the country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=136.8s)]
*  We met some of them in a city you might think of as the capital of free Russia. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=141.8s)]
*  It's 500 miles west of Moscow, the city of Vilnius in Lithuania, where there's no love [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=149.72s)]
*  lost for Russia. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=156.76s)]
*  Lithuania is a democracy of about 3 million people and a NATO ally. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=159.24s)]
*  Vilnius, the capital, is clothed in the colors of Ukraine. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=164.88s)]
*  The city changed the Russian embassy's address to Heroes of Ukraine Street, and Putin is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=170.36s)]
*  reminded the international court in The Hague is waiting with his arrest warrant. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=177.5s)]
*  Since Putin's 2022 invasion, Lithuania has welcomed more than 2,500 Russian exiles. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  It is our policy to provide shelter to all freedom fighters. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=192.82s)]
*  Montas Adomenis served as Lithuania's deputy foreign minister from 2020 until last August. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  I haven't seen so many Ukrainian flags since I was in Kiev. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=206.22s)]
*  Why do your people feel so strongly about this? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=212.7s)]
*  Our freedom, our independence, our sort of security is being defended in the battlefields [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=215.9s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=222.06s)]
*  Ukrainians are dying so that we can be safe. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=223.06s)]
*  There are many more Russian dissidents who would like to come to Lithuania. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=225.56s)]
*  Can you accept any more? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=230.7s)]
*  Yes, I think we can accept. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=232.66s)]
*  Of course, we will accommodate as many as needed and provide them with the possibility [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=234.94s)]
*  to work for the freedom and democracy in Russia. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=239.52s)]
*  One of the Russian exiles in Lithuania working for freedom and democracy is a crusading mom [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=244.66s)]
*  Two years ago, Anastasia Shevchenko fled Putin's regime. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=252.02s)]
*  This is a terrorist regime. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=257.06s)]
*  They are threatening other countries with oil, gas, nuclear weapons and grain. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=259.14s)]
*  They are threatening us with our children, with our parents, with our lives and so on. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=264.46s)]
*  More than anything, it was her daughter Alina, severely disabled at birth, that made Shevchenko [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=270.22s)]
*  an activist against Putin. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=277.4s)]
*  But then the family was in southern Russia and Alina was in a Russian government nursing home. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=280.2s)]
*  Alina could not speak, could not communicate. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=287.2s)]
*  She was like a one-week child, like a baby. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=291.64s)]
*  She was 17, but even to feed her, it was a whole science because she needed blended food. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  You need to hold her in a special position. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=307.28s)]
*  Shevchenko cared for Alina much of the time because the Russian nursing facility was short [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=309.88s)]
*  on staff and supplies. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  I was struggling to get medication for my daughter. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=318.65999999999997s)]
*  Begging in the pharmacy, she needed it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=322.98s)]
*  It was very important for her health. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=327.52s)]
*  They said, no, we just don't have it because the ministry forgot to order it this month [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=331.04s)]
*  and you need to wait. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=337.28s)]
*  I decided I'm not going to keep silence and I'm going to stand out and to speak out. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=339.04s)]
*  She spoke out through a Russian democracy group called Open Russia. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=346.76000000000005s)]
*  It was tolerated 10 years ago and Shevchenko organized protests in her hometown. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  But in 2019, the Kremlin cracked down. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=358.24s)]
*  Shevchenko was arrested and her lawyer warned her she would be shocked by what the police [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=362.0s)]
*  had already done. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=368.48s)]
*  He showed me the screenshots of me in my bed and I realized that they had installed the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=370.36s)]
*  video camera into the air conditioning unit above my bed and they had been watching me [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=378.62s)]
*  for six months in my bedroom. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=385.12s)]
*  A Russian court ordered Shevchenko into house arrest. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=387.92s)]
*  She couldn't visit or care for Alina. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=392.0s)]
*  It wasn't long before her daughter developed pneumonia. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=395.32s)]
*  By the time a judge granted Shevchenko a pass to the hospital, Alina was unconscious. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=398.8s)]
*  I spent maybe 10 minutes holding her hand because that's what I do when my children [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=405.52s)]
*  are ill. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=411.04s)]
*  When you hold their hand, they feel better. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=412.28s)]
*  But this time she was cold. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=415.84s)]
*  She didn't feel me and she died in an hour. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=418.44s)]
*  In 2021, Shevchenko was given a four-year suspended sentence. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=423.92s)]
*  But when Putin invaded Ukraine the next year, she decided to flee Russia. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=429.64000000000004s)]
*  From her southern city, she took her two surviving children on an 1,100-mile drive. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=435.92s)]
*  A U.S.-based democracy group arranged Lithuanian visas. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=442.72s)]
*  What does this tell us about Russia today? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=448.48s)]
*  It's enough to write something on social media. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=451.24s)]
*  Just one sentence and you can be imprisoned for years. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=454.64s)]
*  They are listening to your phone calls. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=459.2s)]
*  They are watching you in your bedroom. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=461.72s)]
*  They are controlling you. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=464.24s)]
*  Breaking that control is why Sergei Davidis also left Russia for Lithuania in 2022. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=466.2s)]
*  You would be in a Russian prison just for doing this interview. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=474.2s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=478.16s)]
*  In Moscow, Davidis helped lead one of Russia's largest human rights groups, called Memorial. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=481.08000000000004s)]
*  It won the Nobel Peace Prize two years ago, but now it's banned. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=488.44s)]
*  He told us, almost every day there are more and more arrests. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=493.44000000000005s)]
*  We hear news about new political arrests. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=500.02000000000004s)]
*  And apart from the legal side of it, more often than before there's violence and torture. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=503.26000000000005s)]
*  Davidis heads Memorial's project to support political prisoners. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=511.06s)]
*  He told us he has confirmed 680 in prison today, but he believes the actual number is [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=516.0600000000001s)]
*  multiples of that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=524.28s)]
*  Since 2022, Russians can be sentenced to 15 years just for criticizing the war on the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=526.52s)]
*  street or in the media. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  One of the consequences of the war, he says, was a complete wipeout of independent mass [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=539.12s)]
*  media, a prohibition of any opinion that's not under control of the government. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=545.4s)]
*  Government newsrooms in Russia have been forced to close. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=553.24s)]
*  Government-controlled newscasts report only the absurd lie that the war is self-defense [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=557.94s)]
*  against Nazis. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=564.4s)]
*  This host says, we are on the side of good against the forces of absolute evil embodied [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=566.92s)]
*  by the Ukrainian Nazi battalions. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=576.44s)]
*  People are scared. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=580.36s)]
*  So they feel lonely. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=582.44s)]

*  station. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=595.36s)]
*  They were allowed to speak their minds until the day Putin launched his war. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=596.4s)]
*  It was my morning show. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=602.64s)]
*  I said it's half past six in the morning. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=604.64s)]
*  War began. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  War began and within two weeks, their station was forced to close. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=611.3199999999999s)]
*  Now, Polushev and Fagenhauer are in Vilnius streaming daily into Russia on YouTube. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=615.64s)]
*  Putin silenced Facebook, X and Instagram, but YouTube may be too popular for the Kremlin [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=624.8s)]
*  to block so far. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=631.84s)]
*  This is the only chance to talk about the war honestly, because the propaganda tries [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=634.12s)]
*  to create this feeling that you are completely alone if you are against the war. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=641.92s)]
*  Why does this mean so much to you? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=651.48s)]
*  Really, I would hate myself if I am silent or pretending that everything is okay. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=653.36s)]
*  If Russian radio and TV stations are allowed only Kremlin talking points, we saw a Lithuanian [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=663.68s)]
*  station telling the truth, not on a channel, but on platform number five to a captive Russian [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=671.68s)]
*  audience. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=679.3599999999999s)]
*  Because part of Russia, Kaliningrad on the left, is separate like Alaska from the lower [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=682.04s)]
*  The Moscow Kaliningrad train must travel through Lithuania. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=688.92s)]
*  The cars are sealed for the transit, but at a stop in Vilnius, Russian passengers were [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=695.68s)]
*  confronted by posters of atrocities. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=702.0s)]
*  Each read, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=705.7199999999999s)]
*  Putin is killing civilians in Ukraine. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=706.88s)]
*  Do you agree with this? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=710.5999999999999s)]
*  The gallery testified as the train waited half an hour. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=712.88s)]
*  There's no way to know how much truth climbed aboard. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=717.28s)]
*  And no one is allowed off the train, in part, because Lithuania worries about Russian agents. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=722.72s)]
*  Putin is infamous for attempting to attack his enemies in foreign countries. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=731.4s)]
*  And I wonder if the Russian dissidents are safe here in Lithuania. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=738.36s)]
*  Of course it is a major concern for us. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=744.8s)]
*  And we spent considerable effort in making sure that dissidents are safe here and safer [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=746.2s)]
*  than they would be in fact in many other countries. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=753.0s)]
*  Have there been attempts? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=755.76s)]
*  Well, I'm afraid I can't release that information in more detail, but let's put it this way, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=756.76s)]
*  that Russia is constantly probing and constantly trying. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=762.9200000000001s)]
*  And this past week, Russia may have gotten through. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=767.12s)]
*  Leonid Volkov was attacked with a hammer outside Vilnius. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  Volkov, on the right, was a top aide to Putin's late rival, Alexei Navalny. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=775.64s)]
*  Volkov's arm was broken. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=782.44s)]
*  The attacker fled. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=784.64s)]
*  President of Russia... [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=786.52s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's re-election this week will bring him to his fifth term, which will cover [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=788.6s)]
*  the next six years. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=794.36s)]
*  Russia... [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=796.16s)]
*  He enjoys support from nationalists who want to believe that today's Russia is an exceptional [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=798.9200000000001s)]
*  nation, but Putin also has weaknesses. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=805.28s)]
*  It's estimated he's lost 300,000 troops killed and wounded, and Russia has a population less [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=809.24s)]
*  than half that of the United States and an economy about the size of Italy's. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=816.52s)]
*  My hope is a country where government takes care about citizens. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=822.88s)]
*  Anastasia Shevchenko is free in Vilnius, but she's wanted in Russia for breaking her probation. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=828.0799999999999s)]
*  These days, she's streaming her own YouTube show and sends medicine, food, and letters [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=835.4s)]
*  to political prisoners. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=841.4s)]
*  She's become another voice to the isolated and the lonely and those like her daughter, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=843.64s)]
*  who will never escape the new iron curtain. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=850.88s)]
*  She was alone, no one next to her. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=854.72s)]
*  I really feel very guilty about it. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=856.88s)]
*  I wouldn't change anything in my life, I think. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=862.28s)]
*  Why not? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=865.92s)]
*  You know, the society in Russia is based on fakes. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=866.92s)]
*  We have fake democracy by constitution. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=872.3199999999999s)]
*  It is a democracy. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=875.36s)]
*  Fake news, fake elections. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=876.92s)]
*  And I want to be the opposite. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=879.92s)]
*  I want to be open. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=882.12s)]

*  Fifteen years ago, we reported on a woman named Jennifer Thompson, a rape victim who [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=905.52s)]
*  was devastated to learn, years after her assault, that she and the police had identified an [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=911.6800000000001s)]
*  innocent man who was convicted and sent to prison while the actual rapist had gone on [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=918.64s)]
*  to attack several more women. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=925.36s)]
*  Not an uncommon story in this era of DNA exonerations. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=928.42s)]
*  And Jennifer Thompson has tried for years to do something about it. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=933.64s)]
*  Thompson knows firsthand that wrongful convictions scar not just the unjustly convicted, but [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=938.88s)]
*  also the original crime victims who are often overlooked. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=945.64s)]
*  So she's doing something no one else has tried and perhaps only she could pull off, bringing [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=950.84s)]
*  together crime victims and innocent men from different cases for what she calls healing [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=957.84s)]
*  justice. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=965.12s)]
*  What I'm going to ask you to do is turn your bowl upside down. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=966.12s)]
*  What we saw on day one of a multi-day group retreat Jennifer Thompson is leading sure [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=971.16s)]
*  didn't look like healing. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=976.88s)]
*  Ten men and women plus an observer smashing bowls with a hammer. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=979.56s)]
*  It was quite something to realize that gluing pieces back together at one table were two [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=993.48s)]
*  women who had been raped at the ages of 15 and 12. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=999.36s)]
*  Sitting across from two men who in unrelated cases had been wrongfully convicted of sexually [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1004.2s)]
*  assaulting children and had each spent more than two decades in prison. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1010.42s)]
*  At the next table, another woman who survived a sexual assault sitting beside a man exonerated [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1017.08s)]
*  for rape and murder. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1024.04s)]
*  And at our table, the partner and daughter of a murder victim. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1026.04s)]
*  Everyone here part of a case where the wrong man was sent to prison for years and years. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1030.72s)]
*  You have said that wrongful convictions aren't a single bullet. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1037.0s)]
*  You said they're bombs. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1041.96s)]
*  A wrongful conviction doesn't hurt like a person. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1043.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not just Raymond Tower got hurt. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1047.28s)]
*  Like his whole family got shrapnel and the victims got shrapnel. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1049.96s)]
*  And the community received shrapnel because a child molester was still in the community. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1055.58s)]
*  There's just so many people in a wrongful conviction case. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1061.02s)]
*  I think it's hundreds of people for every single wrongful conviction case that are hurt. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1065.58s)]
*  Jennifer Thompson was one of them. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1071.9399999999998s)]
*  She was a college student in 1984 when a man broke into her off-campus apartment and raped [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1074.24s)]
*  her at Knife Point. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1081.06s)]
*  Jennifer worked with police to create a composite sketch, then identified a man named Ronald [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1083.5s)]
*  Cotton in the photo and physical lineups police showed her. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1089.34s)]
*  Jennifer testified in court against Ronald Cotton and was relieved when he received a [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1094.1s)]
*  life sentence. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1099.18s)]
*  But after 11 years in prison, DNA testing proved Cotton's innocence and identified the [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1104.26s)]
*  actual rapist whose photo had not been in the lineup. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1110.78s)]
*  Ronald Cotton was exonerated and Jennifer was wracked with guilt as she told us in 2009. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1116.42s)]
*  Shame? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1124.1399999999999s)]
*  Shame. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1125.1399999999999s)]
*  Terrible shame. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1126.1399999999999s)]
*  A suffocating, debilitating shame. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1127.62s)]
*  Jennifer turned that shame into action. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1131.78s)]
*  She apologized to Ronald Cotton in person and then started speaking around the country [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1135.34s)]
*  to police and prosecutors, sometimes together with Cotton, about how to make wrongful convictions [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1141.4199999999998s)]
*  less likely. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1147.74s)]
*  But over the years, as exonerations of the innocent have multiplied, with nearly 3,500 [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1149.62s)]
*  reads so far, based on new evidence, including DNA, Jennifer began focusing in on what was [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1158.42s)]
*  being overlooked. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1165.98s)]
*  What do you think most people feel and see when they see an innocent man come out of [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1167.94s)]
*  prison? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1173.6200000000001s)]
*  It's the day that that man or woman who's wrongfully incarcerated and their families [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1174.6200000000001s)]

*  They're on the court steps and their arms are raised high and it's a day of celebration, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1188.82s)]
*  but for the crime victims, for the murder victim family members, they're sitting back [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1195.14s)]
*  here saying, hey, hold up a second. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1199.26s)]

*  And Loretta Zillinger-White, who was raped at age 15 on the way to school one morning [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1240.94s)]

*  It's hard. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1249.38s)]
*  People expect you to just put it behind you and not think about it again. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1250.76s)]
*  And they don't realize that it's going to affect you for the rest of your life. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1256.5800000000002s)]
*  All these women, like Jennifer, had identified a suspect the police showed them only to learn [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1261.26s)]
*  years later that those men were innocent and they were gripped by a whole new nightmare. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1267.38s)]
*  I felt so bad for him because I felt like I sent this man to prison. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1274.18s)]
*  That's all I could think about. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1280.26s)]
*  I got scared. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1281.7800000000002s)]
*  I felt like he was going to try to come out and kill me. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1282.7800000000002s)]
*  I just...I shut down. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1285.18s)]
*  Did people blame you? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1289.5400000000002s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1291.5400000000002s)]
*  The first time I went out in public, a friend came up to me and said, I can't believe you're [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1292.7s)]
*  showing your face. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1299.22s)]
*  They were saying that I needed to go to prison. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1300.7s)]
*  That you needed to go? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1303.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1305.3s)]
*  That I intentionally sent the wrong man to prison. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1306.3s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1308.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1309.3s)]
*  It was bad. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1310.3s)]
*  Memory experts have long understood how crime victims can get it wrong. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1313.3s)]
*  In our earlier story about Jennifer's case, Professor Gary Wells showed us a simulated [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1318.3s)]
*  crime scene and then a lineup. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1323.8999999999999s)]
*  You know now after we've talked, probably not to pick anyone. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1326.98s)]
*  No, no, actually. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1331.06s)]
*  I actually know who it is because if I had come upon that, I think it's this guy. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1332.86s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1338.6599999999999s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1339.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1340.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm wrong? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1341.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1342.6599999999999s)]
*  It's none of them. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1343.6599999999999s)]
*  Studies have shown again and again when the actual perpetrator is not in the lineup, witnesses [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1345.18s)]
*  often pick the wrong man who then comes to replace the original offender in their memory [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1351.22s)]
*  of the crime. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1357.5800000000002s)]
*  In Jennifer's case and to Misha and Penny's, the real perpetrators revealed by DNA years [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1358.98s)]
*  later had not been in the original lineups. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1366.3400000000001s)]
*  Twenty years later when they come to me and say, by the way. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1370.66s)]
*  Oh, I can't imagine. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1373.66s)]
*  The person who raped you never went to prison. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1375.42s)]
*  And the person we thought is innocent, Sia. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1378.8200000000002s)]
*  And oh, by the way, it's all your fault. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1383.66s)]
*  It's not the system's fault. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1385.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, here was my narrative. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1387.42s)]
*  Rape victim falsely accuses an innocent man and sends him to prison. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1390.3400000000001s)]
*  Everything's wrong with that because a false accusation denotes a lie. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1396.94s)]
*  Deliberate. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1400.66s)]
*  Why would a crime survivor, why would a victim want the wrong person to go to prison? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1401.72s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense at all. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1407.28s)]
*  You know, when you hear what you're saying, then we get it, but we don't hear it. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1409.16s)]
*  As you said, there's a blazing headline. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1414.28s)]
*  Man is freed. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1417.0s)]
*  Person who fingered him got it wrong. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1418.48s)]
*  That's it. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1421.72s)]
*  And the system now doesn't get held accountable for how it failed me and it failed my family [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1422.72s)]
*  and it failed the innocent person and it failed the innocent person's family and it failed [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1430.0s)]
*  everybody. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1434.24s)]
*  That failure, Jennifer told us, is also devastating for families of murder victims even when they [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1436.1599999999999s)]
*  played no role themselves in identifying the wrongfully convicted person. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1442.76s)]
*  That's what happened to Andrea Harrison and her father, Dwayne Jones. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1448.4399999999998s)]
*  Andrea's mother, Jacqueline, was raped and murdered in 1987 when Andrea was just three [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1453.8s)]
*  years old. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1460.24s)]
*  It was one of the most horrendous crimes. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1461.24s)]
*  She was brutally raped, tortured. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1464.2s)]
*  Someone found her body walking the dog. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1467.2s)]
*  A local man named Larry Peterson spent more than 17 years in prison for the crime before [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1470.36s)]
*  DNA testing proved his innocence and he was released. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1476.9199999999998s)]
*  Did you know that he was going to be released? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1481.76s)]
*  Did they tell you? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1484.12s)]
*  No. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1485.12s)]
*  No. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1486.12s)]
*  For many, many years someone was tried, convicted and put away. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1487.12s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1491.56s)]
*  And then you find out that the DNA doesn't match. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean you go back into flight or flight. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1498.36s)]
*  You got scared. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1501.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1502.32s)]
*  Absolutely we did. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1503.32s)]
*  Can you tell us of what? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1504.32s)]
*  Who's the person? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1505.32s)]
*  Who hurt my mother? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1506.32s)]
*  What happened to Jackie? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1507.92s)]
*  Who did it? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1509.04s)]
*  Whoever that person is, they're still out there. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1510.04s)]
*  But since Larry Peterson's exoneration, with the case now cold, they feel the original [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1512.48s)]
*  crime and victim have become an afterthought. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1518.2s)]
*  It's always been, what do you think about Mr. Peterson? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1522.8s)]
*  That is not my charge. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1525.42s)]
*  I care about Jackie. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1526.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm worried about Jackie. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1527.6399999999999s)]
*  What about Jackie? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1529.02s)]
*  But even while victims and their families are left reeling in the wake of wrongful [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1530.7s)]
*  Jennifer knows from her friendship with Ronald Cotton and her work with other exonerees, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1536.76s)]
*  that heady, blissful first day of freedom is just the start of a tough, years-long struggle [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1543.08s)]
*  to rebuild. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1549.8s)]
*  Raymond Towler, exonerated after 29 years in prison, 29 years, plays in a band with [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1553.48s)]
*  other exonerees, and says he struggles with the lingering stigma and hurt of being charged [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1561.76s)]
*  with such a heinous crime. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1568.04s)]
*  Tell us if it's not too painful what the crime was. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1570.44s)]
*  It's painful. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1572.8s)]
*  I know, I'm sorry. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1573.8s)]
*  I'm laughing over it, but it is painful. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1574.8s)]
*  But it was rape of 11 and 12-year-old kids. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1578.24s)]
*  When DNA testing finally proved Towler's innocence and won his freedom, he says it was thrilling [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1582.92s)]
*  but also daunting. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1592.2s)]
*  The adjustment was difficult. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1594.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1595.64s)]
*  I couldn't even really go out the door by myself. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1596.64s)]
*  You don't feel like you fit in anywhere. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1599.4s)]
*  At least I did. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1601.0s)]
*  Exonerees' stories are often filled with egregious police and prosecutorial misconduct. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1603.88s)]
*  In Chris Ochoa's case, abusive interrogations that led to a false confession to rape and [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1609.88s)]
*  murder. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1617.0s)]
*  For Howard Dudley, evidence withheld by prosecutors that likely would have cleared him of child [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1618.1s)]
*  sexual abuse, for which he served more than 23 years. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1624.3799999999999s)]
*  I always dream of being there with my kids, see the football game, see them on the basketball [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1629.3s)]
*  court. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1634.02s)]
*  Didn't get a chance to see none of that. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1635.02s)]
*  So I would like for everybody to introduce themselves. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1639.78s)]
*  So Jennifer came up with a novel idea. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1642.3799999999999s)]
*  So I am Jennifer Thompson. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1646.06s)]
*  I am a victim survivor. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1647.7s)]

*  I'm an exoneree. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1652.46s)]
*  My name is Loretta. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1654.06s)]

*  My name is Chris. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1661.9s)]
*  I'm an exoneree. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1662.9s)]

*  My name is Penny. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1665.98s)]

*  I am Tameshia. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1669.1000000000001s)]
*  As well as family members. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1670.68s)]
*  My brother was an exoneree. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1672.7s)]
*  My name is Andrea. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1674.74s)]
*  Healing Justice paid to bring them from around the country to this rented retreat center [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1676.86s)]
*  in Virginia, where they will spend three days sharing stories, playing games, and eating [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1681.82s)]
*  all their meals together. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1692.2199999999998s)]
*  This is the 17th retreat Healing Justice has done. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1694.08s)]
*  How effective is it when it's not the same crime? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1698.28s)]
*  Very effective. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1702.1799999999998s)]
*  There's something powerful and healing when an exoneree can hear what the victim in their [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1703.54s)]
*  case must have felt like. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1709.42s)]
*  And for crime survivors, it's really healing to also hear about the experiences of exonerees. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1711.3600000000001s)]
*  The biggest thing I lost was trust. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1716.78s)]
*  Three days of emotional release, rebuilding trust and healing when we come back. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1722.16s)]
*  Jennifer Thompson's goal when she created the nonprofit organization Healing Justice [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1733.18s)]
*  in 2015 was to help all groups harmed by wrongful convictions. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1745.6200000000001s)]
*  Healing Justice now advises prosecutor's offices around the country on dealing more [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1752.0800000000002s)]
*  effectively and empathetically with crime victims in exoneration cases. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1757.58s)]
*  And they've recently gotten a grant from the Justice Department to expand those efforts. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1763.86s)]
*  But it's what they call the healing side of their work that is most meaningful to Jennifer. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1769.6599999999999s)]
*  She did coursework and trauma recovery and worked with psychologists to design a program [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1775.98s)]
*  to safely bring together victims of crime and exonerees. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1782.22s)]
*  They work in small groups on the wounds left behind when the justice system gets it wrong. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1787.7s)]
*  Remember the breaking and gluing back together of those bowls? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1798.98s)]
*  Did anybody notice how fast and easy it was to break it and how hard it is to put it back [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1801.98s)]
*  together again? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1808.82s)]
*  That was just the start of this retreat's opening exercise and perhaps a metaphor for [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1810.64s)]
*  the whole endeavor. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1816.5200000000002s)]
*  So what I'm going to ask you to do now is to paint your broken places with gold. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1817.5200000000002s)]
*  This is actually 24 karat gold paint. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1824.5200000000002s)]
*  She told us it's called kintsugi. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1827.16s)]
*  Kintsugi. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1830.3200000000002s)]
*  Kintsugi. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1831.3200000000002s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1832.3200000000002s)]
*  What is that? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1833.3200000000002s)]
*  The Japanese concept that even in our broken places we're still beautiful because we're [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1835.0s)]
*  strong at our broken places and we're not disposable. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1840.7s)]
*  But before they can paint their real wounds with gold, they have to look hard at the breaks [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1845.54s)]
*  that need repair. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1851.06s)]
*  I lost part of my heart. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1852.7s)]
*  So sitting in a circle, using a rock to give whoever holds it the floor, and with a healing [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1855.86s)]
*  justice social worker always present, they talked about their losses. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1861.86s)]
*  I lost believing in myself. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1867.58s)]
*  I had so much confidence. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1869.1799999999998s)]
*  I had so much. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1871.3799999999999s)]
*  That first slam on the doors, everything got real right then. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1874.74s)]
*  I seen people suicide, stuff by a cop just getting beat up, killed. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1880.1799999999998s)]
*  The talk comes back and I have to keep reminding myself, you know, right here I'm in the present [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1887.74s)]
*  right now. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1894.74s)]
*  The hardest part for me is hearing what the exonerees went through in prison. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1897.98s)]
*  It's so hard to hear, but it's so necessary. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1903.94s)]
*  On day two of the retreat, Jennifer led an exercise on how the harsh words used against [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1909.14s)]
*  each of them end up becoming internalized. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1915.74s)]
*  You might have been called a liar. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1919.42s)]
*  You might have been called a rapist. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1921.1s)]
*  And those words really do take on a life of their own. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1922.6599999999999s)]
*  I'd like for you to write a letter to yourself from the space of the critical mind, that [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1925.7s)]
*  loop that plays in your head over and over again. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1931.62s)]
*  You had them write letters. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1935.22s)]
*  What was the purpose? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1937.6599999999999s)]
*  I've done this before. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1938.6599999999999s)]
*  When they're writing it, they're not happy. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1941.1s)]
*  And then I had them read it out loud to the circle. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1943.8600000000001s)]
*  They didn't like it. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1946.94s)]
*  Dear Chris, you failed in life. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1948.5s)]
*  Why did you confess? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1951.0200000000002s)]
*  I will never have confessed. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1952.0200000000002s)]
*  Why can't you just be quiet? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1954.3400000000001s)]
*  Dear Raymond, you are a angry black man. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1956.42s)]
*  You will never know love. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1961.3000000000002s)]
*  You will always be a prisoner. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1963.14s)]
*  And then there was Loretta's. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1967.94s)]
*  Dear Loretta, you deserve to be raped and beaten. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1971.62s)]
*  You really don't deserve to be alive. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1976.58s)]
*  You aren't brave nor strong. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1981.1s)]
*  You are a failure as a woman and a mother. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1983.2199999999998s)]
*  Loretta, Jennifer told us, faces one of the most excruciating situations for a victim [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1985.86s)]
*  in an exoneration case, when the DNA clears one man but doesn't identify who the actual [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1991.6599999999999s)]
*  assailant was. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=1998.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm stuck. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2000.5s)]
*  She told us she relives the assault daily and can't get the exonerated man's face out [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2001.98s)]
*  of her memory. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2008.82s)]
*  So even though he was cleared through DNA, his face is still there. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2010.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2015.26s)]
*  The DNA said it wasn't him. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2016.26s)]
*  You didn't believe it? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2024.26s)]
*  No. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2025.8600000000001s)]
*  I feel guilty. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2026.86s)]
*  Because I feel like I did something wrong. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2031.6999999999998s)]
*  So you're having both the feeling that he was the one and that you did something wrong. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2035.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2040.62s)]
*  Oh my God, you really are stuck. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2041.62s)]
*  I don't know who did this. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2044.62s)]
*  For Andrea Harrison, whose mother's killer also remains unknown, it's a familiar struggle. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2047.3s)]
*  What was told to me was that he was the person who murdered my mother. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2054.66s)]
*  And so that was a belief of mine for a lot of years. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2058.58s)]
*  I can't get that out of my head. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2062.98s)]
*  On his side of it, I mean that's sad. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2064.8999999999996s)]
*  It is sad. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2069.02s)]
*  The justice system failed him just like it did us. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2070.3399999999997s)]
*  Until now, Andrea and her father had not been willing to attend a retreat with exonerees [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2074.3399999999997s)]
*  present. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2080.1s)]
*  Do you think that the exonerated person and the victim are almost pitted against each [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2081.2999999999997s)]
*  other when they shouldn't be? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2087.2599999999998s)]
*  They're both victims of the same perpetrator who knows someone sitting in jail for what [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2089.38s)]
*  he or she did. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2094.94s)]
*  That's right. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2096.5s)]
*  At the end of the day, when an innocent person's in prison, a guilty person's not. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2097.5s)]
*  We should all be concerned about that. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2102.06s)]
*  And maybe they go off and do it many more times. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2103.7799999999997s)]
*  In my case, the person who wasn't caught committed six more first degree rapes before he was [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2107.02s)]
*  ever apprehended. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2112.82s)]
*  I just love that we're here working on this. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2114.82s)]
*  In the circle, after reading the critical letters, Jennifer turned the tables. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2117.46s)]
*  So I want you to write a second letter now to yourself from the self-compassion voice, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2123.1000000000004s)]
*  the voice that you would use for the person you love the most. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2129.86s)]
*  So they rewrote it. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2133.46s)]
*  They did. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2134.82s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2135.82s)]
*  And then they read that out loud in their faces. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2136.82s)]
*  They smiled when they read it. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2139.3s)]
*  Dear Raymond, you have a kind heart. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2140.78s)]
*  You are loved. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2143.82s)]
*  Raymond, your dreams have come true and you are free to dream more and create. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2144.82s)]
*  You are a great mother, grandmother, wife, daughter, sister, friend, and so on and on. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2152.02s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2157.6600000000003s)]
*  You got this. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2158.6600000000003s)]
*  I've seen you stumble and I've seen you bounce right back. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2159.6600000000003s)]
*  Dear Loretta, you know that it's never too late to follow your dreams. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2164.18s)]
*  You should never stop believing in yourself. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2168.7799999999997s)]
*  You didn't deserve to be hurt by anyone or anything. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2171.3599999999997s)]
*  I will always be your biggest fan and supporter. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2174.8199999999997s)]
*  I love you. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2177.54s)]
*  That was different. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2179.7s)]
*  So why is it that we speak to ourselves in a way that we would never speak to the people [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2181.4199999999996s)]
*  that we love? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2186.94s)]
*  Something that I need to change is that it was actually harder to write the happy letter [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2188.46s)]
*  for me. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2194.38s)]
*  I do believe the good things about myself, but I don't think I really say them to myself [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2195.38s)]
*  enough. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2202.66s)]
*  And the reality is, if we really want to do good in the world, hating ourselves serves [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2203.66s)]
*  nobody at all. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2210.46s)]
*  Who's ready? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2213.1s)]
*  After two emotion-filled days came a scene we weren't expecting. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2214.7s)]
*  The group gathered together for improv games, acting like animals, smiling and laughing. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2220.2999999999997s)]
*  You play a lot of games. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2234.98s)]
*  The games are just really a way of inviting that child to come back and play again. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2237.14s)]
*  If you feel safe, you can pretend like you're a monkey. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2242.64s)]
*  You can do all kinds of ridiculous things, and it's okay because everybody else is doing [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2249.12s)]
*  it too. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2253.72s)]
*  I know, but don't you feel guilty? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2254.72s)]
*  We noticed a loosening and connecting. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2256.68s)]
*  Later that night over an art project, the kind of impromptu conversation Jennifer says [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2260.44s)]
*  this retreat is all about. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2266.68s)]
*  How can somebody look at me and think that I would do something? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2269.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm so heinous like that. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2272.36s)]
*  That's part of the trauma for me. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2274.04s)]
*  When you hear some of our stories, do you ever blame us? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2276.1200000000003s)]
*  Like me being an exoneree? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2285.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2288.28s)]
*  Do you ever see yourself blaming the victims for... [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2289.48s)]
*  You didn't do anything wrong. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2293.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not your fault. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2296.28s)]
*  The next morning as they gathered in the circle for the third and final day... [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2300.24s)]
*  I feel blessed. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2305.3599999999997s)]
*  I feel light as a feather. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2307.0s)]
*  The mood had shifted dramatically. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2308.24s)]
*  I feel open. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2311.4399999999996s)]
*  I feel courageous. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2316.68s)]
*  I feel nurtured. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2319.04s)]
*  Even though it's painful to let it out, I think you guys do it because you know it's [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2320.04s)]
*  going to help the next person, and it has. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2324.8799999999997s)]
*  So how did the retreat go? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2328.76s)]
*  Very enlightening. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2331.0800000000004s)]
*  Very powerful. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2333.0s)]
*  We took off the mask that everybody sees. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2334.26s)]
*  What questions did you ask each other? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2337.0400000000004s)]
*  Exonerees to crime victims and back around. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2341.6400000000003s)]
*  I asked what happened to you. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2344.5600000000004s)]
*  When everyone was honest... [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2346.48s)]
*  When everybody was honest, I asked right away. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2347.6000000000004s)]
*  I shook Mr. Howard's hand, and I feel for this man and my other two friends back there [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2349.7200000000003s)]
*  that are exonerees. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2356.1600000000003s)]
*  I see it now because we only looked from our side of the table. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2357.66s)]
*  We never seen it from their side. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2361.98s)]
*  I had that fear even when I came here. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2364.14s)]
*  I didn't know if I would be coming into hate because I was an exoneree. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2367.02s)]
*  Nobody believed me for 30 years. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2371.2999999999997s)]
*  I think we believe it. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2374.8999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2377.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2378.1s)]
*  I had questions myself for an exoneree, and I was able to build up the courage to even [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2379.1s)]
*  ask Raymond because I still hold this guilt. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2385.94s)]
*  And I was finally able to let it go after talking to him. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2389.86s)]
*  I knew he was speaking from his heart. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2393.94s)]
*  And it took 30 years for him to let me get that guilt off of me. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2396.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2403.18s)]
*  I thank you. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2404.82s)]
*  Do you have any guilt for what happened to Ronald? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2408.86s)]
*  No, not anymore. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2413.18s)]
*  I feel so sad that for 11 years he was in prison for something he didn't do, but I'm [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2414.58s)]
*  also really sad that I got raped at knife point and chased around neighborhood in the [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2421.2999999999997s)]
*  dark while I didn't have any clothes on. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2426.7s)]
*  I feel a deep amount of sadness for these cases and for everybody who's impacted by [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2429.18s)]
*  them. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2434.54s)]
*  May you keep spreading your love to everyone that needs it. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2435.54s)]
*  So as the retreat drew to a close, they clasped hands and shared wishes for one another. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2439.26s)]
*  Penny, may you continue on your journey of healing? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2446.0200000000004s)]
*  What happened in your case that allowed you to heal? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2450.7200000000003s)]
*  I think I'll always be healing. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2457.1200000000003s)]
*  But I think what has helped me more than anything is the relationships I've built along the [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2459.6600000000003s)]
*  with people that have been harmed and hurt just like me. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2466.22s)]
*  Because you're helping other people. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2470.7799999999997s)]
*  Jennifer, may you always be in our lives and may you always be courageous. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2473.1s)]
*  I'm helping other people, but what they don't realize is they're also helping me. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2481.02s)]
*  I didn't know that movie. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2486.8199999999997s)]
*  They're healing. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2491.9399999999996s)]
*  They are healing. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2493.02s)]
*  And I want to walk with them on that journey. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2494.02s)]
*  Woo-wee! [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2497.2599999999998s)]
*  The last minute of 60 minutes is sponsored by UnitedHealthcare, there for what matters. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2498.2599999999998s)]
*  Now, an update of our story, Agency in Crisis, about the Federal Bureau of Prisons, particularly [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2518.54s)]
*  its women's prisons. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2523.62s)]
*  This past Monday, FBI agents raided one of them, FCI Dublin, in Northern California. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2525.42s)]
*  So notorious for sexual abuse and retaliation against those who speak up, it is known as [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2531.94s)]
*  the Rape Club. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2537.46s)]
*  We asked Bureau of Prisons Director Colette Peters if the government owes the inmates [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2539.06s)]
*  more than a safe environment. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2543.72s)]
*  Is your job to apologize for what happened in Dublin? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2546.18s)]
*  I don't know that my job is to apologize. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2548.74s)]
*  Is it heartbreaking and horrendous to have something like that happen when you are proud [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2551.3799999999997s)]
*  of your profession as a corrections professional? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2556.66s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2559.58s)]
*  The Bureau of Prisons still hasn't publicly apologized for the abuse at Dublin, but it [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2561.3799999999997s)]
*  has removed the latest warden and three top administrators. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2565.94s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2570.14s)]
*  We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GStcv7jQ8&t=2571.14s)]
