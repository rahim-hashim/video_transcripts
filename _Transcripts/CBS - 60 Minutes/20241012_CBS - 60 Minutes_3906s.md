# Historic Atrocities | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [October 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k)
*  War is a war over oil, land, water, but rarely over history, especially about something that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=0.0s)]
*  happened nearly a hundred years ago. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=20.88s)]
*  But that's what Turkey and Armenia are still fighting over, what to label the mass deportation [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=23.64s)]
*  and subsequent massacre of more than a million Christian Armenians from Ottoman Turkey during [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=29.64s)]
*  the First World War. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=35.16s)]
*  Armenians, and an overwhelming number of historians, say that Turkey's rulers committed genocide, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=36.84s)]
*  that its actions were a model for what Hitler did to the Jews. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=43.56s)]
*  The Turks, meanwhile, say their ancestors never carried out such crimes, and that they [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=47.64s)]
*  too were victims in a world war. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=52.72s)]
*  Ever since, this battle over history has not only ensnared the two nations, but even the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=56.04s)]
*  White House and Congress, where resolutions officially recognizing the genocide are currently [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  moving through the House and Senate. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=68.4s)]
*  But our story begins where the lives of so many Armenians ended, far from Istanbul in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=71.4s)]
*  the desert. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  We took a drive into what is now Syria, to the barren wilderness, to what amounts to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=81.4s)]
*  the largest Armenian cemetery in the world. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  As many as 450,000 Armenians died here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  Peter Balakian is an Armenian-American author who's written extensively about what happened [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  in this desolate place. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=99.44s)]
*  450,000 Armenians died here in this spot in the desert. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=101.84s)]
*  In this region called Deir Zor, yes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=106.12s)]
*  It's the greatest graveyard of the Armenian genocide. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=108.92s)]
*  Deir Zor is to Armenians what Auschwitz is to Jews. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=113.2s)]
*  The most ghoulish thing about the place is that 95 years later, the evidence of the massacres [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=116.76s)]
*  is everywhere. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=122.36s)]
*  Just a short distance from the banks of the Euphrates, there's a dump. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=124.4s)]
*  It's also the site of a mass grave. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=128.16s)]
*  It has never been excavated. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=130.52s)]
*  All we had to do was scratch the surface of the sand to collect evidence of what had happened [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=138.0s)]
*  It's the hill full of bones, fractures. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=139.0s)]
*  Little fragments of bones. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=140.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=142.6s)]
*  Dr. Harout Karvejian, an Armenian dentist, was our guide. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=143.6s)]
*  This is the bone of the wrist. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=147.68s)]
*  The wrist. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=151.16s)]
*  The wrist. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=152.16s)]
*  I've been lying here for 95 years. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=153.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=155.2s)]
*  Here we go, more here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=156.2s)]
*  Look at this one. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=158.04s)]
*  My God. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=159.04s)]
*  It looks like a joint bone. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=160.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=164.04s)]
*  Nobody bothered to dig them up until now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=165.16s)]
*  It was extraordinary standing on a mound where perhaps thousands of people lie in tune. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=168.64s)]
*  There's no record of who they were or where they could have come from. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=173.64s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  We've got these kids who know this area just picking up bones by the dozen. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  Evidence comes in many forms. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=184.2s)]
*  It comes in photographs. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=186.12s)]
*  It comes in texts and telegrams. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=187.12s)]
*  And it also comes in bones. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=190.24s)]
*  So just how did all these bones end up here? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=194.88000000000002s)]
*  In 1915, the First World War was raging and the Ottoman Empire was crumbling. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  The Armenians were a Christian minority who were considered infidels by the ruling Muslims. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=205.36s)]
*  The Fifth Column resided with the enemy in the war. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  The fact that they were prosperous didn't help, says Balakian, whose great-uncle survived [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=215.36s)]
*  the genocide and wrote about it in the memoir Armenian Golgotha. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=220.08s)]
*  Like the Jews of Europe, the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire had a dominant role in [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=224.72s)]
*  commerce and trade. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  They were highly educated. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=231.44s)]
*  And highly resented. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=232.96s)]
*  And highly resented. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=234.28s)]
*  What happened next? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=235.52s)]
*  What happens from the spring of 1915 on through the summer is a well-orchestrated project [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=236.72000000000003s)]
*  of government-planned arrests and deportations. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=245.56s)]
*  Some were forced to buy round-trip tickets for train journeys from which they never returned. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=251.28s)]
*  They ended up in boxcars. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=256.2s)]
*  The rest, mostly women and children, were forced on death marches hundreds of miles. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=258.16s)]
*  Many perished from starvation, disease or brutal killings. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=263.96s)]
*  The survivors ended up in concentration camps hundreds of miles from Istanbul. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=268.32s)]
*  Out of sight. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=274.04s)]
*  At the time of the deportations, American diplomats in the region sent dispatches to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=275.54s)]
*  Washington detailing what they had seen and heard. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=280.1s)]
*  Just weeks after the arrests of Armenians had begun, Henry Morgenthau, the U.S. ambassador [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=284.02000000000004s)]
*  here, sent off this one. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=288.70000000000005s)]
*  Deportation of and excesses against peaceful Armenians is increasing. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=291.90000000000003s)]
*  And from harrowing reports of eyewitnesses, it appears that a campaign of race extermination [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=296.26s)]
*  is in progress. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=302.26s)]
*  To this day, the Turks vigorously deny there was any such campaign. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=304.54s)]
*  When we spoke to Nabi Sensoy, he was Turkey's ambassador to Washington. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=309.98s)]
*  We were in Syria, sir, and we scratched the sand and came up with bones. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=315.06s)]
*  How can you argue with that? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, bones you can find anywhere in Turkey, you know. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=321.82000000000005s)]
*  There have been a lot of tragedies that happened in those lands. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=325.34000000000003s)]
*  Excuse me, sir. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=329.22s)]
*  You dug up these bones in a place called Derzur, which Armenians say is their equivalent [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=330.22s)]
*  of Auschwitz. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=335.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, I don't think there was anything comparable to Auschwitz. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=336.14000000000004s)]
*  This was only deportation, and things happened on the road. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=341.02000000000004s)]
*  But the deportations entered in massacres, didn't they? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=344.22s)]
*  No, it did not. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=346.62s)]
*  Weren't there massacres, mass executions, and death marches of the Armenians? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=347.62s)]
*  There was no death marches of Armenians. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=352.54s)]
*  There was deportation, and tragic things happened. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  Many people perished under the deprivations of the First World War. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=359.74s)]
*  But did what happened in 1915 amount to genocide? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=363.78000000000003s)]
*  The UN defines it as the intent to destroy a racial, ethnic, or religious group. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  The most important thing is the intent. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=374.02s)]
*  The killings is something else. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=377.46000000000004s)]
*  It's happened on both sides. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=379.66s)]
*  But whether it constitutes genocide is another matter. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=381.54s)]
*  It's a legal word, and it should not be lightly used. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=384.62s)]
*  But you're saying there was no intention of the Turkish government? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=387.85999999999996s)]
*  There was no intention of annihilating in all, in part, the Armenian population. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=390.7s)]
*  Bishop Sarkin Sarkisian is convinced that the massacres were intended and meticulously [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=397.06s)]
*  executed. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=403.9s)]
*  He showed us one of the caves into which he said, untold numbers of Armenians, women, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=404.9s)]
*  and children were thrown. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=410.41999999999996s)]
*  It looks like you could walk for miles down here. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=412.06s)]
*  I think so. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=414.94s)]
*  It was, the Armenians believe, a primitive gas chamber. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=416.94s)]
*  They lit fires at the mouth of the cave, and the people inside couldn't breathe anymore. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=421.18s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=426.66s)]
*  And there is no other way to escape out. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=427.66s)]
*  The Ottoman Turks developed a template which, according to genocide scholars, was later [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=430.02s)]
*  to be adopted by the Nazis. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=434.94s)]
*  And most dramatically, we have Adolf Hitler saying, eight days before invading Poland [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=437.3s)]
*  in 1939, who today, after all, speaks of the annihilation of the Armenians. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=442.9s)]
*  Hitler was inspired by the Armenian extermination. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=449.06s)]
*  You know, it made him think, well, sure, you know, you can get rid of a hated minority [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=452.82s)]
*  group and if you're powerful and your side wins, that event will never get recorded. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=459.41999999999996s)]

*  the events of 1915. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=471.06s)]
*  Nonetheless, when the Ottomans were swept from power and the modern Turkish state was [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=473.26s)]
*  founded, all memory of what happened to the Armenians was erased. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=478.38s)]
*  Records were destroyed, a new alphabet was adopted, and ever since, the massacres have [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=483.34000000000003s)]
*  not been taught in schools. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=488.62s)]
*  The use of the word genocide is regarded as an insult to the Turkish nation. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=490.74s)]
*  It is a jailable offense. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=495.82s)]
*  Horan Dink, who edited an Armenian newspaper in Turkey, was prosecuted three times for [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=499.22s)]
*  insulting the Turkish nation. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=505.22s)]
*  He also received thousands of death threats from extremists, but kept on writing. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=507.62s)]
*  His daughter, Delal, recalls the Turkish authorities telling her father they couldn't protect him. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=513.1800000000001s)]
*  They were kind of warning my father about what might happen. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=518.38s)]
*  And the days following that, nationalist groups came in front of Agos. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=524.78s)]
*  In front of your father's newspaper. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=533.4599999999999s)]
*  Yes, in front of the newspaper, shouting that he is their target and he is their enemy and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=534.9399999999999s)]
*  one day they will come for him. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=544.6999999999999s)]
*  Years later, as he stepped outside that same office, he was shot at point blank range. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=548.38s)]
*  Dink is viewed as a martyr now in Armenia, where he is seen as the latest victim of the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=557.1s)]
*  genocide. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=562.74s)]
*  His picture emerges from the Wall of Flowers on a hillside outside the capital, Yerevan, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=564.1s)]
*  where every April hundreds of thousands attend a memorial to remind the Turks and the world [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=570.26s)]
*  of what they went through. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=575.94s)]
*  They pay homage to those who died nearly a century ago. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=577.86s)]
*  It's as if the entire country turns out for what is emotionally a funeral, a burial, the [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=581.58s)]
*  victims never had. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=587.38s)]
*  And on the same day in Times Square, thousands of Armenian Americans gather to demand that [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=591.46s)]
*  Congress pass a resolution recognizing the genocide. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=597.58s)]
*  Two years ago, when a resolution was to be put to a vote in the House, Turkey recalled [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=602.22s)]
*  Ambassador Sensoy in protest. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=606.58s)]
*  Its president warned of serious troubles and its top general said military ties with the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=609.1s)]
*  U.S. would never be the same. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=614.1s)]
*  To limit further damage, the Bush administration and eight former secretaries of state weighed [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=616.42s)]
*  in to kill the bill. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=621.7s)]
*  It worked. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=623.42s)]
*  Eight former secretaries of state rallied behind Turkey to defeat that resolution. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=624.94s)]
*  Why do you think that was, sir? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=630.34s)]
*  Well, I think it's the importance of Turkey for the United States. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=632.3s)]
*  We have a long list of positive agenda between us. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=636.66s)]
*  And the items on that list, Sensoy says, are far more important than the Armenian issue. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=641.54s)]
*  Turkey is, after all, a regional superpower and an essential broker between the U.S. and [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=649.18s)]
*  the Muslim world. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=655.9799999999999s)]
*  It has the second largest army in NATO, and the U.S. relies on the country's air bases [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=657.54s)]
*  for its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=662.98s)]
*  70 percent of American supplies to those wars go through Turkey, which is also a crucial [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=665.58s)]
*  conduit for oil, which is probably why no U.S. president has uttered the word genocide. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=671.74s)]
*  During his presidential campaign, candidate Obama promised that if elected, he would use [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=679.5s)]
*  the word. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=685.1s)]
*  The Armenian Genocide, he said, is a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=686.1s)]
*  body of historical evidence. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=692.1s)]
*  But when President Obama made his first overseas trip to Turkey, he never mentioned the word. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=696.4200000000001s)]
*  Late last year, the U.S. brokered an agreement between Turkey and Armenia to establish diplomatic [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=704.58s)]
*  relations with one key condition, that a historical commission be formed to rule on [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=710.74s)]
*  whether a genocide took place. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=716.74s)]
*  Nearly six months later, the deal appears to be unraveling. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=719.3s)]
*  The battle over the use of the word is far from over. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=723.1800000000001s)]
*  Last year, when archaeologists detected what they believed to be 200 unmarked graves at [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=726.74s)]
*  an old school in Canada, it brought new attention to one of the most shameful chapters of that [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=742.38s)]
*  nation's history. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=747.3s)]
*  Starting in the 1880s and for much of the 20th century, more than 150,000 children from [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=749.14s)]
*  hundreds of Indigenous communities across Canada were forcibly taken from their parents [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=754.58s)]
*  by the government and sent to what were called residential schools. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=759.7s)]
*  Funded by the state and run by churches, they were designed to assimilate and Christianize [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=764.58s)]
*  Indigenous children by ripping them from their parents, their culture, and their community. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=769.0200000000001s)]
*  The children were often referred to as savages and forbidden from speaking their languages [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=774.74s)]
*  or practicing their traditions. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=779.4200000000001s)]
*  As we first reported earlier this year, many were physically and sexually abused and thousands [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=781.7s)]
*  of children never made it home. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=787.5s)]
*  The last of Canada's 139 residential schools for Indigenous children closed in 1998. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=791.1s)]
*  Most have been torn down. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=798.22s)]
*  But the Muskaugan Residential School in Saskatchewan still stands, its windows boarded up, its [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=800.1s)]
*  rooms gutted. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=806.4200000000001s)]
*  A reminder to a nation that would rather forget, a three-story tombstone for generations of [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=808.2199999999999s)]
*  children who died here. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=814.26s)]
*  Sometimes, I wish it would be gone for all what happened here. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=815.8199999999999s)]
*  You wish this had been torn down? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=819.9799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=821.5799999999999s)]
*  I could hear everything in here, what was done. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=822.5799999999999s)]
*  It lingers. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=826.8599999999999s)]
*  Leona Wolfe, who comes from the Muskaugan Reserve, was five years old, and she says she was taken [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=827.8599999999999s)]
*  from her home in 1960. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=834.06s)]
*  School officials and police would often show up unannounced in Indigenous communities and [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=836.78s)]
*  round up children, some as young as three. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=841.5799999999999s)]
*  Parents could be jailed if they refused to hand their children over. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=845.5s)]
*  When kids arrived at their schools, their traditional long hair was shaved off. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=849.1s)]
*  If they tried to speak their language, they were often punished. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=853.5799999999999s)]
*  They put me in a dark room like that, and they'd shut the door, and then they'd take [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=857.9399999999999s)]
*  off the light. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=863.22s)]

*  She says the abuse many kids in Muskaugan suffered from the Catholic priests and nuns [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=870.9s)]
*  wasn't just physical. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=876.22s)]
*  Father Joelle was fondling the girls here. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=878.34s)]
*  A priest, Father Joelle, was fondling girls? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=882.98s)]
*  Yeah, this used to be sick bay. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=885.1800000000001s)]
*  This used to have a bed here. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=887.26s)]

*  She was only eight. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=895.5s)]
*  I grew up a very, very mean woman because of all what happened to me. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=897.98s)]
*  You learned that here, you think? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=906.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=908.26s)]
*  She is not the only one. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=909.26s)]
*  More than 150,000 children were sent to residential schools, which Canada's first prime minister [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=911.38s)]
*  supported to, in his words, sever children from the tribe and civilize them. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=917.04s)]
*  After much of the 20th century, the Canadian government supported that mission. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=923.68s)]
*  This report aired in 1955. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=928.28s)]
*  They learned not only games and traditions, such as the celebration of St. Valentine's [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=930.28s)]
*  Day, but the mastery of words. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=935.52s)]
*  The idea for the schools came in part from the United States. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=938.12s)]
*  In 1879, the Carlisle Indian Industrial School opened in Pennsylvania, where this photo was [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=942.04s)]
*  taken of Native American children when they first arrived. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=948.4399999999999s)]
*  This is them four months later. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=952.42s)]
*  The school's motto was, kill the Indian, save the man. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=954.62s)]
*  Consequently, ours was, kill the Indian in the child. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=959.14s)]
*  Kill the Indian in the child. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=963.38s)]
*  That was the guiding principle here in Canada. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=965.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=968.06s)]
*  Chief Wilton Littlechild, whose pre was six years old when he was taken to this residential [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=969.06s)]
*  school in Alberta, then he says he was given a new name. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=973.9s)]
*  My name was number 65 for all those years. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=979.1999999999999s)]
*  Just a number? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=982.88s)]

*  65, pick that up, stupid. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=984.88s)]
*  Or 65, why'd you do that, idiot? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=986.88s)]
*  What does that feel like, at six years old, to be called a number? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=989.76s)]
*  Well, I think that's where the trauma begins. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=992.68s)]
*  Not just the physical abuse, psychological abuse, spiritual abuse, and worst of all, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=995.8s)]
*  sexual abuse. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1002.56s)]
*  You were sexually abused? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1003.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1004.88s)]
*  I think that's where my anger began as a young boy. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1005.88s)]
*  Chief Littlechild says he was able to take some of that anger out on the school's hockey [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1014.88s)]

*  No. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1527.8999999999999s)]
*  You made peace with the Virgin Mary by singing that song. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1528.8999999999999s)]
*  I made peace with myself. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1532.06s)]
*  Last April at the Vatican, Pope Francis apologized to Canada's Indigenous peoples for the deplorable [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1535.54s)]
*  abuses they suffered in Catholic-run residential schools. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1541.1000000000001s)]
*  He'll travel to Canada next month to make the apology in person. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1545.1000000000001s)]
*  Last year, the death of George Floyd in the hands of Minneapolis police came on Memorial Day. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1561.8200000000002s)]
*  Ninety-nine years before, that same week, Black Americans suffered a massacre. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1567.8200000000002s)]
*  In the days after World War I, a neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, called Greenwood, was [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1575.3000000000002s)]
*  among the wealthiest Black communities. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1581.0600000000002s)]
*  Oil made Greenwood rich, but jealousy made it suffer. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1584.38s)]
*  In 1921, a white mob with incendiary rage burned Greenwood to ash. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1589.82s)]
*  Even memories were murdered when the dead were dropped into unmarked graves. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1596.1399999999999s)]
*  In December of 2019, before the pandemic, we found Tulsa preparing to embrace a reckoning [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1600.8s)]
*  with a plan to exhume the truth and raise the dead. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1607.8799999999999s)]
*  The community that is Greenwood has thriving businesses, professional offices, doctors, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1614.06s)]
*  lawyers, dentists. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1621.98s)]
*  John W. Franklin speaks of Greenwood in the present tense. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1624.98s)]
*  Greenwood is the nexus of that African-American community. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1630.1399999999999s)]
*  Perhaps because he studied Greenwood in 32 years as a historian at the Smithsonian, or [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1633.8999999999999s)]
*  likely because Greenwood is personal. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1639.6599999999999s)]
*  My grandfather moved here from Rentersville in February 1921, and he's the first person [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1644.26s)]
*  in the family to go to college, Buck Colbert Franklin. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1651.0600000000002s)]
*  Buck Colbert Franklin was a lawyer who chased his dream to a promised land. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1654.8200000000002s)]
*  Booker T. Washington named Greenwood Negro Wall Street because the district was lined [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1661.18s)]
*  with black-owned shops, restaurants, two newspapers, a 54-room Grand Hotel, a hospital, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1667.18s)]
*  and the Dreamland Theater, which would soon boast air conditioning. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1675.38s)]
*  But on the day after Memorial Day 1921, Buck Franklin awoke to fearful news. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1679.94s)]
*  He hears that there's to be possibly a lynching. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1686.9s)]
*  There's this black man who's been caught with this white woman in the elevator, and [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1691.18s)]
*  the newspapers are saying, read all about it. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1697.42s)]
*  There's extra, extra, read all about it. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1699.66s)]
*  Tulsa's white newspapers told of a black teenager who allegedly attacked a white female elevator operator. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1702.02s)]
*  At the jail, a lynch mob demanded the prisoner. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1710.18s)]
*  Black veterans of World War I arrived to shield the defendant for his day in court. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1714.38s)]
*  A shot was fired, and in a running gun battle, the mob chased the black vets to Greenwood. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1720.78s)]
*  One of the moments during the riot that your grandfather wrote about was this. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1728.46s)]
*  On they rushed, whooping to the tops of their voices, firing their guns every step they took. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1733.14s)]
*  What is it like for you to read those words today? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1741.7s)]
*  He too was traumatized by seeing people being shot in front of his eyes. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1745.22s)]
*  He describes a woman who's trying to find her child, who's running in front of her, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1752.46s)]
*  and she's unafraid of the bullets raining down because her concern is to find her child. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1758.14s)]
*  What began as an attempted lynching at the jail erupted into a massacre. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1765.54s)]
*  From a high grain elevator, a machine gun laid fire on Greenwood Avenue. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1771.42s)]
*  Where's the fire department? Where's the police when we need them? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1777.46s)]
*  We're part of a city. This is not some small town. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1781.78s)]
*  This is a city of wealth and order and governance. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1785.54s)]
*  It is now taken over by a mob. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1791.8600000000001s)]
*  The police joined the mob. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1794.46s)]
*  National Guard troops pressed the attack against what one guard officer called the enemy. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1797.34s)]
*  Quotes from eyewitnesses include, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1803.6599999999999s)]
*  Old women and men, children, were running and screaming everywhere. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1806.3s)]
*  A deputy sheriff reported a black man dragged behind a car. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1811.4199999999998s)]
*  His head was being bashed in, the deputy said, bouncing on the steel rails and bricks. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1815.6599999999999s)]
*  But what happened next may have frightened Buck Franklin even more. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1822.8999999999999s)]
*  And he hears planes circling and sees roofs of buildings catching fire. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1828.58s)]
*  And these are from turpentine balls, burning turpentine balls dropped from planes. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1836.4599999999998s)]
*  The first time in American history the airplanes were used to terrorize America [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1841.74s)]
*  was not in 9-11, was not at Pearl Harbor. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1847.3799999999999s)]
*  It was right here in the Greenwood district. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1850.58s)]
*  Reverend Robert Turner's Vernon AME Church was among at least five churches burned, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1853.8999999999999s)]
*  along with 1,200 homes. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1860.1399999999999s)]
*  A photo was crudely and imperfectly hand lettered at the time, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1863.34s)]
*  running the Negro out of Tulsa. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1868.26s)]
*  Thirty-six odd square blocks, city blocks, was destroyed. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1871.62s)]
*  And before they destroyed it, they looted, they took nice furniture, money. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1875.34s)]
*  When the black hospital burned, white hospitals refused to take Greenwood's wounded. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1880.4199999999998s)]
*  Those who bled to death included Greenwood's most prominent surgeon. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1887.1s)]
*  Ultimately, one hospital did make space in its basement for black casualties. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1891.4199999999998s)]
*  The number of dead is estimated between 150 and 300. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1897.02s)]
*  Survivors included 10,000 now homeless African Americans. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1901.8999999999999s)]
*  Six thousand of them were herded into internment camps and then released weeks later. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1907.58s)]
*  I don't know how they did it, but the following Sunday after the massacre, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1916.1799999999998s)]
*  they came and worshiped in our basement. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1920.6599999999999s)]
*  And that's the same basement that we have today. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1922.86s)]
*  The murder of a black man at the hands of police is today shouted into the national memory. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1927.22s)]
*  Thanks to all of you for being here. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1932.98s)]
*  But in 1921, it remained possible to erase a genocide. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1935.18s)]
*  I grew up attending segregated Tulsa public schools. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1941.38s)]
*  Never in any of the schools was anything ever said about it. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1944.98s)]
*  The congregation of Vernon AME Church is two generations beyond 1921, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1949.9s)]
*  but they too were victimized. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1955.94s)]
*  This was not taught in the public school. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1958.18s)]
*  No, you never heard about this in class. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1961.26s)]
*  You never heard a word about it. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1963.5800000000002s)]
*  When I went to OU in 1998, I was sitting in a class on African American history. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1965.94s)]
*  And the professor was talking about this place where black people had businesses and had money [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1971.3s)]
*  and had doctors and lawyers. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1977.06s)]
*  And he said it was in Tulsa. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1978.94s)]
*  And I raised my hand and said, no, I'm from Tulsa. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1980.02s)]
*  That's not accurate. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1985.42s)]
*  And he was talking about this massacre. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1987.1000000000001s)]
*  I asked him, man, what are you talking about? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1989.6200000000001s)]
*  I said, I went to school on Greenwood. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1991.38s)]
*  I've never heard of this ever. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1992.8200000000002s)]
*  How many people were arrested, tried for what happened in Greenwood? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1994.8600000000001s)]
*  No one. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=1999.8200000000002s)]
*  Two or 300 people murdered. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2001.5800000000002s)]
*  An entire community burned to the ground. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2003.74s)]
*  And the police were unable to find a single person. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2006.54s)]
*  It's a real tragedy. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2010.46s)]
*  All the thousands of claims that were filed by African Americans, not a one, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2012.1s)]
*  not a one insurance company paid that claim. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2017.5s)]
*  And our church was included. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2020.3799999999999s)]
*  No insurance honored for black Tulsans, no arrests made, no complete count of the dead. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2022.3s)]
*  The Salvation Army recorded only that it fed 37 gravediggers. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2029.62s)]
*  The Nameless were buried in unmarked graves. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2036.5s)]
*  While their families were locked down in the internment camps. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2039.98s)]
*  I wonder if there are any doubts in this room about whether there are mass graves in Tulsa, Oklahoma. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2044.02s)]
*  No doubts. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2049.86s)]
*  My great grandmother... [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2051.26s)]
*  Oral history's passed down generations pointed to at least four sites of possible mass graves. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2053.3s)]
*  As a mayor, I view it as a homicide investigation. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2060.9s)]
*  Phase one... [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2063.94s)]
*  G.T. Bynum is Tulsa's Republican mayor. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2065.06s)]
*  In 2018, he ordered an investigation of all remaining evidence. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2068.94s)]
*  What you have is a case of law and civil order being overrun by people who were filled with hatred. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2074.78s)]
*  We believe at the end of this road we're walking down right now is one of the sites where we found an anomaly. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2085.58s)]
*  Anomalies of disturbed earth showed up in the studies of Scott Hammerstedt. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2094.06s)]
*  That's not a mower. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2099.9s)]
*  It's ground penetrating radar. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2101.2999999999997s)]
*  And right here is the anomaly as we see it. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2103.7s)]
*  He's a senior researcher at the Oklahoma Archaeological Survey. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2105.94s)]
*  The anomalies that we're looking at, what are those? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2110.14s)]
*  It's just a contrast between the surrounding soil that's undisturbed and then this soil that has been disturbed. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2113.5s)]
*  So we're not seeing in these images human remains? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2120.14s)]
*  No, no, it's definitely not like CSI. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2124.2999999999997s)]
*  You don't see individual skeletons. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2126.14s)]
*  You just see disturbances and contrasts, which is why you can't really say necessarily that for sure it's a common grave, but it's very consistent with one. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2127.42s)]
*  Of course, there's any number of things it could be. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2135.3399999999997s)]
*  That's always the thing I have to remind myself. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2137.8199999999997s)]
*  And there's only one way to find out. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2141.58s)]
*  That is exactly right. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2143.2999999999997s)]
*  We have to dig. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2144.9s)]
*  We have to dig. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2145.7799999999997s)]
*  An excavation in October led by University of Florida forensic anthropologist Phoebe Stubblefield revealed a mass grave with at least 12 individuals. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2148.58s)]
*  Determining cause of death will be complicated because of that period's Spanish flu pandemic. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2160.66s)]
*  So just because you find a burial site, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's from the massacre. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2167.9s)]
*  Correct. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2174.38s)]
*  And so I'm interested in markers like signs of violence or any kind of ballistic injuries or chop injuries. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2174.82s)]
*  Can you retrieve DNA? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2182.7400000000002s)]
*  If it's a good preservation state, there's a high probability. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2184.78s)]
*  Would it be possible, in your opinion, to actually identify some of these people? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2188.94s)]
*  We could try for genealogical matches. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2194.98s)]
*  So if we had people now who say, oh, I'm missing a relative from that time period, here's my DNA, then we can make matches through similar markers and do the genealogical matches. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2197.86s)]
*  There's a long legacy from 1921. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2211.82s)]
*  Tulsa is still one of the most segregated cities in the country. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2214.26s)]
*  The north part of Tulsa is black. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2218.42s)]
*  The south part is white. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2220.9s)]
*  And the Twain don't meet very much. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2222.58s)]
*  Right. Because of the history of racial disparity that exists in our city, a kid that's growing up in the predominantly African-American part of our city is expected to live 11 years less than a kid that's growing up in a wider part of the city. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2224.74s)]
*  By the way, Tulsa is not unique in that regard. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2241.74s)]
*  You see disparities like that in major cities all around America. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2243.9799999999996s)]
*  A full excavation begins on June 1st. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2248.2599999999998s)]
*  Next steps include recommendations for permanent burial and the question of how to honor those who have waited 100 years for justice. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2252.1s)]
*  How do you commemorate an event that gives dignity and honor to the people who have been lost? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2264.2599999999998s)]
*  We have taken in recent decades in our memorials to etch the names of every single person who was lost. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2271.86s)]
*  The 9-11 Memorial, the Vietnam Memorial. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2283.06s)]
*  That's not going to be possible here. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2286.38s)]
*  We don't know the names. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2288.82s)]
*  We don't know the names. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2290.38s)]
*  And you're going to have to do some kind of, you know, we have the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2292.1400000000003s)]
*  So it has to be something that is representative of lost souls, lost in anonymity. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2299.38s)]
*  Something like that will have to be planned. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2310.46s)]
*  No one can say when human remains began surfacing in Clearwater, Florida, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2321.02s)]
*  There was the pipeline crew that churned up bones in a trench. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2327.14s)]
*  Later, remains of the dead were found at an elementary school, a swimming pool and an office building. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2331.18s)]
*  It seemed like something of a curse for what had been done in the name of progress and greed in the old segregated South. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2338.8199999999997s)]
*  As we first reported last fall, the truth of what happened in the 40s and 50s was meant to stay buried. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2347.2999999999997s)]
*  But in a neighborhood called Clearwater Heights, residents with long memories recognized a grave injustice. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2355.06s)]
*  In the first half of the 20th century, Clearwater Heights was a black neighborhood thriving, proud and anchored by faith. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2365.06s)]
*  Friendship Missionary Baptist Church, Bethany CME and New Zion Missionary Baptist Church were all located on the Heights. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2374.62s)]
*  And so is St. Matthew's Baptist, where we heard stories of childhood in the Heights, including those of Diane Stevens and Eleanor Breland. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2384.58s)]
*  They had businesses, barber shops. There were hairdressers over there. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2394.5s)]
*  There was a cab company. I don't have one cab, but it was still a cab company. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2401.74s)]
*  Right there on Greenwood, they had different places where even Ray Charles performed there. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2408.86s)]
*  Also, James Brown performed up there. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2413.9s)]
*  But even the famous could not stay in a white Clearwater Hotel or walk on the beach or swim in the bay. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2416.9s)]
*  Segregation bound their lives and exiled even their memory to segregated graveyards. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2425.26s)]
*  How many of you believe you have ancestors in one of these cemeteries? About half of you. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2433.2200000000003s)]
*  The segregated cemeteries of Clearwater were sacred ground until the ground became valuable. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2440.7s)]
*  In the 1950s, headlines announced that the city of Clearwater made a deal on moving a Negro cemetery. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2447.9399999999996s)]
*  Hundreds of African-American bodies were to be reburied to make way for a swimming pool. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2456.3799999999997s)]
*  A department store was planned for the site of another black cemetery, where again the bodies were to be moved. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2462.9s)]
*  But O'Neill Larkin remembers, many years later, his first revelation that something was terribly wrong. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2471.7400000000002s)]
*  It's not an imaginary thing that I've seen. It's what I've seen with my own eyes. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2480.14s)]
*  Larkin, 83 years old, watched a construction crew in 1984 dig a trench through the site of a relocated black cemetery. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2485.58s)]
*  But I remember the parking lot where the engineers, traffic engineers, was cutting the lines through and they cut through two coffins. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2496.74s)]
*  That was my first knowledge of seeing it because I walked out there and I seen it myself. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2506.86s)]
*  In 2019, the Tampa Bay Times reported many segregated cemeteries in Florida had been essentially paved. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2512.06s)]
*  It was then that the modern city of Clearwater decided to exhume the truth. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2522.06s)]
*  People deserve to be treated with respect. That's the most important thing. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2527.2999999999997s)]
*  Rebecca O'Sullivan and Erin McKendry are archaeologists for a company called Cardno. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2532.34s)]
*  Cardno was hired by the city to map the desecration. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2538.66s)]
*  These individuals were loved. They were family members. They were fathers and mothers. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2543.18s)]
*  And they were interred with love. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2550.06s)]
*  McKendry and O'Sullivan pushed ground-penetrating radar over a segregated cemetery where this office site stands today. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2553.7s)]
*  This overlay shows part of their discovery. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2563.38s)]
*  328 likely graves, many under the parking lot, perhaps a few under the building, and more there on the right beneath South Missouri Avenue. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2566.58s)]
*  550 graves are in the cemetery's record. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2579.7400000000002s)]
*  McKendry and O'Sullivan found evidence of 11 having been moved in the 1950s. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2583.54s)]
*  So there may be hundreds of bodies still at that site. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2591.58s)]
*  It's possible. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2595.1s)]
*  Not far away, the archaeologists probed another former cemetery. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2597.58s)]
*  Where there's more of what looks like the intact graves. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2601.8199999999997s)]
*  Here in the 1950s, rather than integrate the white community pool, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2605.98s)]
*  the city said it would move hundreds of bodies to build a black swimming pool and a black school. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2611.8199999999997s)]
*  But the bodies weren't removed. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2619.06s)]
*  Cardano found the proof last year. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2620.98s)]
*  It excavated just deep enough to confirm what ground-penetrating radar had suggested. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2623.54s)]
*  It is their resting place. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2630.42s)]
*  A prayer was said over the site. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2632.26s)]
*  Then they planed the sand and sieved a century of time in search of grave markers or tributes. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2634.58s)]
*  Inevitably, relics included human remains, teeth at the office building site, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2644.94s)]
*  and bones at the school, which had closed in 2008 because it was obsolete. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2651.46s)]
*  Are there grave sites underneath the school? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2658.9s)]
*  All of the information and the data that we collected does indicate that there are additional [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2661.62s)]
*  burials likely below the footprint of that school building. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2666.02s)]
*  O'Neill Larkin watched the excavation and imagined the ground-breaking at the school [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2669.22s)]
*  construction site in 1961. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2674.2599999999998s)]
*  To dig the foundation to put this school upon, they had to hit some form of remains. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2677.62s)]
*  It's likely some families could not afford to dig the ground. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2686.18s)]
*  The school was built in the 1960s. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2689.8599999999997s)]
*  Some form of remains. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2693.7s)]
*  It's likely some families could not afford a tombstone, but the archaeologists found [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2696.82s)]
*  graves were marked. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2702.2599999999998s)]
*  Doesn't that look like one of those metal plaques? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2704.5s)]
*  This is a marker that would have been used initially after the burial if a stone was [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2707.46s)]
*  not ready to be placed. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2713.14s)]
*  And in some cases, this is all that would have been used to mark the location of a burial. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2714.98s)]
*  Erin McKendry showed us Cardano's catalog of evidence. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2720.42s)]
*  It's a mercury dime. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2723.94s)]
*  It is a mercury dime. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2725.1400000000003s)]
*  This dime, new and 42, was among many tributes left with the dead. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2726.5s)]
*  We also found this brass wedding ring at approximately the same location and the same [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2731.86s)]
*  depth as the dime. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2736.9s)]
*  The tributes and disturbed human remains were carefully reburied exactly where they were [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2739.3s)]
*  found, pending a decision on what to do next. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2745.86s)]
*  If you could speak to these people who were interred and then lost, what would you tell them? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2750.9s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2757.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm working. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2759.46s)]

*  There are abandoned cemeteries across the board. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2846.58s)]
*  There are cemeteries that are not only African American cemeteries or black cemeteries that [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2849.06s)]
*  have been in some way desecrated, but the issue is more acute with black cemeteries because of [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=2854.2599999999998s)]

*  In this one, we found a monument to a Confederate soldier, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3033.2200000000003s)]
*  his grave decorated today with a fresh banner of racism. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3037.46s)]

*  the small cemetery under those trees in the middle was granted a reverent circular detour. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3049.46s)]

*  It is not often you get the chance to meet a man who holds a place in history like Ben Ferenz. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3091.06s)]
*  When we first reported on him back in 2017, he was 97 years old, barely five feet tall, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3106.82s)]
*  and he had served as prosecutor of what's been called the biggest murder trial ever. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3115.38s)]
*  The courtroom was Nuremberg, the crime genocide, and the defendants, a group of German SS officers, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3121.62s)]
*  accused of committing the largest number of Nazi killings outside the concentration camps. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3129.7s)]
*  More than a million men, women, and children shot in their own towns and villages in cold blood. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3135.94s)]
*  Ferenz is the last Nuremberg prosecutor alive today, but he isn't content just being a part [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3143.86s)]
*  of 20th century history. He believes he has something important to offer the world right now. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3150.9s)]
*  You know, you have seen the ugliest side of humanity. You've really seen evil. And look at [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3157.94s)]

*  Get some more friends. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3171.22s)]
*  Watching Ben Ferenz during his daily swim, his gym workout, and his morning push-up regimen [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3176.4199999999996s)]

*  And that's just the beginning. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3193.14s)]
*  The case we present is a plea of humanity to law. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3195.2999999999997s)]
*  This is Ferenz making his opening statement in the Nuremberg courtroom 73 years ago. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3200.9s)]
*  The charges we have brought accuse the defendants of having committed crimes against humanity. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3206.1800000000003s)]
*  The Nuremberg trials after World War II were historic, the first international war crimes [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3213.06s)]
*  tribunals ever held. Hitler's top lieutenants were prosecuted first. Then a series of subsequent [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3218.7400000000002s)]
*  trials were mounted against other Nazi leaders, including 22 SS officers responsible for killing [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3225.7s)]
*  more than a million people, not in concentration camps, but in towns and villages across Eastern [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3232.4199999999996s)]

*  You look so young. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3244.02s)]
*  I was so young. I was 27 years old. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3245.54s)]
*  Had you prosecuted trials before? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3249.7s)]
*  Never in my life. I don't recall if I'd ever been in a courtroom actually. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3252.18s)]
*  Ferenz had immigrated to the U.S. as a baby, the son of poor Jewish parents from a small [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3256.9s)]
*  town in Romania. He grew up in a tough New York City neighborhood where his father found work [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3262.9s)]
*  as a janitor. Ferenz learned quickly. He became the first in his family to go to college, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3268.98s)]
*  then got a scholarship to Harvard Law School. But during his first semester, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3275.3s)]
*  the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and he, like many classmates, raced to enlist. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3279.94s)]
*  He wanted to be a pilot, but the Army Air Corps wouldn't take him. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3285.94s)]
*  You're too short. Your legs won't reach the pedals. The Marines, they just looked at me and said, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3291.46s)]
*  forget it, kid. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3296.02s)]
*  So he finished at Harvard, then enlisted as a private in the Army. Part of an artillery [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3298.18s)]
*  battalion, he landed on the beach at Normandy and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3304.1s)]
*  Toward the end of the war, because of his legal training, he was transferred to a brand new unit [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3309.46s)]
*  in General Patton's Third Army created to investigate war crimes. As U.S. forces liberated [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3315.3s)]
*  concentration camps, his job was to rush in and gather evidence. Ferenz told us he is still [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3322.26s)]
*  haunted by the things he saw and the stories he heard in those camps. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3329.3s)]
*  A father who, his son told me the story, his father had died just as we were entering the camp. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3334.42s)]
*  And the father had routinely saved a piece of his bread for his son, and he kept it under his arm. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3342.2599999999998s)]
*  He kept it under his arm at night so the other inmates wouldn't steal it, you know. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3354.1s)]
*  So you see these human stories which are not, they're not real, they're not real, but they were real. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3359.46s)]
*  Ferenz came home, married his childhood sweetheart, and vowed never to set foot in Germany [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3367.7s)]
*  again. But that didn't last long. General Telford Taylor, in charge of the Nuremberg Trials, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3374.66s)]
*  asked him to direct a team of researchers in Berlin, one of whom found a cache of top secret [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3381.22s)]
*  documents in the ruins of the German Foreign Ministry. Gave me a bunch of [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3387.7s)]
*  binders, four binders, and these were daily reports from the Eastern Front, which unit entered which [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3393.3799999999997s)]

*  Einsatzgruppen, or action groups. Their job had been to follow the German army as it invaded the [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3413.46s)]

*  at work. It isn't easy to watch. Well this is typical operation. Well see here, this they rounded [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3447.86s)]

*  Okay. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3465.14s)]
*  This footage came to light years later. At the time, Ferenz just had the documents and he started [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3469.22s)]
*  adding up the numbers. When I reached over a million people, murdered that way, over a million [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3476.1s)]
*  people, more people than you've ever seen in your life. I took a sample, I got on the next plane, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3480.9s)]
*  flew from Berlin down to Nuremberg, and I said to Taylor, General, we've got to put on a new trial. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3486.58s)]
*  But the trials were already underway and prosecution staff was stretched thin. Taylor told [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3491.78s)]
*  Ferenz adding another trial was impossible. And I started screaming. I said look, I got here, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3498.1800000000003s)]
*  mass murder, mass murder on a parallel scale. And he said, can you do this in addition to your other [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3503.78s)]
*  work? And I said, sure. He said, okay, so you do it. And that's how 27-year-old Ben Ferenz became [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3509.38s)]
*  the chief prosecutor of 22 Einsatzgruppen commanders at trial number nine at Nuremberg. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3515.62s)]
*  How do you plead to this indictment? Guilty or not guilty? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3523.22s)]
*  Standard routine. Not guilty. Guilty or not guilty? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3528.58s)]
*  They all say not guilty. Same thing. Not guilty. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3534.58s)]
*  But Ferenz knew they were guilty and could prove it. Without calling a single witness, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3537.2999999999997s)]
*  he entered into evidence the defendant's own reports of what they had done. Exhibit 111. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3543.3s)]
*  In the last 10 weeks, we have liquidated around 55,000 Jews. Exhibit 179 from Kiev in 1941. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3550.02s)]
*  The Jews of the city were ordered to present themselves. About 34,000 reported, including [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3559.46s)]
*  women and children. After they had been made to give up their clothing and valuables, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3565.46s)]
*  all of them were killed, which took several days. Exhibit 84 from Einsatzgruppen D in March of 1942. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3570.9s)]
*  Total number executed so far, 91,678. Einsatzgruppen D was the unit of Ferenz's [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3580.5s)]
*  lead defendant Otto Ohlendorf. He didn't deny the killings. He had the gall to claim they were done [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3589.3s)]
*  in self-defense. He was not ashamed of that. He was proud of that. He was carrying out his [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3596.1s)]
*  government's instructions. How did you not hit him? There was only one time I wanted to really, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3602.18s)]
*  one of these, my defense, he gets up and he says, which is what? The Jews were shot. I hear it here [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3609.54s)]
*  for the first time. Boy, I felt if I had a bayonet, I would have jumped over the thing. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3620.74s)]
*  I put a bayonet right through one ear and let it come out the other. You know? Son of a bitch. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3625.2999999999997s)]
*  And you had his name down on a piece of- I've got his reports of how many he killed. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3630.3399999999997s)]
*  Innocent clam. Did you look at the defendant's faces? Defendants' faces were blank all the time. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3635.7s)]
*  Defendants absolutely blank. They could like this. They're waiting for a bus. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3642.58s)]
*  What was going on inside of you? Me? Yeah. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3647.0600000000004s)]
*  I'm still churning. To this minute? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3652.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm still churning. All 22 defendants were found guilty, and four of them, including Olandorf, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3660.42s)]
*  were hanged. Forenz says his goal from the beginning was to affirm the rule of law [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3667.86s)]
*  and deter similar crimes from ever being committed again. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3674.42s)]
*  Did you meet a lot of people who perpetrated war crimes who would otherwise, in your opinion, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3678.58s)]
*  have been just a normal, upstanding citizen? Of course, is my answer. These men would never [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3685.14s)]
*  have been murderers had it not been for the war. These were people who could quote Goethe, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3691.06s)]
*  who loved Wagner, who were polite. What turns a man into a savage beast like that? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3696.26s)]
*  He's not a savage. He's an intelligent, patriotic human being. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3703.3s)]
*  He's a savage when he does the murder, though. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3706.1800000000003s)]
*  No. He's a patriotic human being acting in the interest of his country in his mind. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3708.6600000000003s)]
*  You don't think they turn into savages even for the act? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3714.9s)]
*  Do you think the man who dropped the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima was a savage? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3717.46s)]
*  Now I will tell you something very profound, which I have learned after many years. War makes [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3723.1400000000003s)]
*  murderers out of otherwise decent people. All wars and all decent people. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3728.34s)]
*  So, Ferenz has spent the rest of his life trying to deter war and war crimes by establishing an [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3736.82s)]
*  international court like Nuremberg. He scored a victory when the International Criminal Court [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3743.78s)]
*  in The Hague was created in 1998. He delivered the closing argument in the court's first case. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3749.6200000000003s)]
*  Now you've been at this for 50 years, if not more. We've had genocide since then. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3758.34s)]
*  Yes. Going on right this minute. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3764.98s)]
*  Going on right this minute. In Sudan, we've had Rwanda, we've had Bosnia. You're not getting very far. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3766.42s)]
*  Well, don't say that. People get discouraged. They should remember from me, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3773.06s)]
*  it takes courage not to be discouraged. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3777.54s)]
*  Did anybody ever say that you're naive? [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3780.1000000000004s)]
*  Of course. Some people say I'm crazy. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3783.46s)]
*  Are you naive here? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3785.06s)]
*  Well, if it's naive to want peace instead of war, let them make sure they say I'm naive, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3786.58s)]
*  because I want peace instead of war. If they tell me they want war instead of peace, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3791.62s)]
*  I don't say they're naive. I say they're stupid. Stupid to an incredible degree to send young people [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3795.86s)]
*  out to kill other young people they don't even know, who never did anybody any harm, never harmed [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3801.94s)]
*  them. That is the current system. I am naive. That's insane. Thank you very much. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3807.46s)]
*  Ferenz is legendary in the world of international law, and he's still at it. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3814.82s)]
*  Are you going to help me save the world? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3820.02s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3821.54s)]
*  It's up to you. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3822.5800000000004s)]
*  He never stops pushing his message. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3823.78s)]
*  War, not war. Never give up. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3825.7000000000003s)]
*  And he's donating much of his savings to a genocide prevention initiative at the Holocaust [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3829.6200000000003s)]
*  Museum. He says he's grateful for the life he's lived in this country, and it's his turn to give [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3835.2200000000003s)]
*  back. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3841.2200000000003s)]
*  You are such an idealist. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3841.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't think I'm an idealist. I'm a realist, and I see the progress. The progress has been [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3843.86s)]
*  remarkable. Look at the emancipation of women in my lifetime. You're sitting here as a female. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3848.1000000000004s)]
*  Look what's happened to the same-sex marriages. To tell somebody a man can become a woman, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3853.1400000000003s)]
*  a woman can become a man, and a man can marry a man, they always said you're crazy. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3857.6200000000003s)]
*  But it's a reality today. So the world is changing, and you shouldn't, you know, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3862.1000000000004s)]
*  be despairing, because it never happened before. Nothing new ever happened before. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3867.38s)]
*  But what about the role? We're a marching poet. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3872.02s)]
*  Ben, I'm sitting here listening to you, and you're very wise, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3874.58s)]
*  and you're full of energy and passion, and I can't believe you're 97 years old. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3878.34s)]
*  Well, I'm still a young man. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3884.34s)]
*  Clearly. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3886.1s)]
*  And I'm still in there fighting, and you know what keeps me going? I know I'm right. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1CZGpa50k&t=3886.74s)]
