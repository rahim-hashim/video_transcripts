*  espionage operation against the U.S. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=66.0s)]
*  in its history. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=68.0s)]

*  agencies spans more than [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=76.0s)]
*  30 years. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=78.0s)]
*  He says since [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=80.0s)]
*  President Xi Jinping came to power [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=82.0s)]

*  spies no longer seem to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=86.0s)]
*  fear the U.S. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=88.0s)]
*  Why do China's espionage [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=90.0s)]
*  efforts appear to be growing so big, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=92.0s)]
*  so fast, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=94.0s)]
*  under Xi Jinping? Xi Jinping thinks [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=96.0s)]
*  it's China's time to move to the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=98.0s)]
*  center of the world stage. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=100.0s)]
*  Xi Jinping looks at the West [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=102.0s)]
*  and at the U.S. and says, these people are [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=104.0s)]
*  feeble-minded, and I'm going to be able [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=106.0s)]
*  to beat them. It may not be a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=108.0s)]
*  household name in the U.S., [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=110.0s)]
*  but according to Lewis, China's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=112.0s)]
*  Ministry of State Security, or [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=114.0s)]
*  MSS, is now the largest [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=116.0s)]
*  and most active spy agency [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=118.0s)]
*  in the world. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=120.0s)]
*  In a propaganda video the spy [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=124.0s)]
*  agency posted last year on [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=126.0s)]
*  China's largest social network, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=128.0s)]
*  a voiceover boasts that the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=130.0s)]
*  MSS senses things [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=132.0s)]
*  before they happen and fights [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=134.0s)]
*  against evil. The slick [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=136.0s)]
*  production is a public message [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=138.0s)]
*  to both foreign adversaries [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=140.0s)]
*  and China's own citizens [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=142.0s)]
*  about the ministry's growing [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=144.0s)]
*  power. It's sort of the equivalent [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=146.0s)]
*  of the CIA, but it has [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=148.0s)]
*  much greater powers. One [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=150.0s)]
*  estimate says the MSS [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=152.0s)]
*  might have 600,000 employees, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=154.0s)]
*  and they are committed [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=156.0s)]
*  to going after the United States. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=158.0s)]
*  We are target number two for them. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=160.0s)]
*  Who's target number one? Target number one [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=162.0s)]
*  is China's own people. When Xi [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=164.0s)]
*  Jinping wakes up screaming in the middle [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=166.0s)]
*  of the night, he's really worried that the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=168.0s)]
*  Chinese Communist Party was on the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=170.0s)]
*  path that the Soviet Communist Party [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=172.0s)]
*  was on. Lewis says to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=174.0s)]
*  maintain absolute power at [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=176.0s)]
*  home, President Xi looks [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=178.0s)]
*  abroad. Xi Jinping [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=180.0s)]
*  probably remembers that a lot of revolutions [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=182.0s)]
*  start outside the home country, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=184.0s)]
*  and he doesn't want that to happen to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=186.0s)]
*  China. So there's a huge effort [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=188.0s)]
*  to pay attention to the ex-patriot [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=190.0s)]
*  population. One [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=192.0s)]
*  way Beijing paid attention, according [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=194.0s)]
*  to the FBI, was to secretly [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=196.0s)]
*  open an overseas Chinese [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=198.0s)]
*  police station right in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=200.0s)]
*  the middle of New York City. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=202.0s)]
*  It was discovered in 2022, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=204.0s)]
*  hidden among businesses [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=206.0s)]
*  in a commercial building in Manhattan's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=208.0s)]
*  Chinatown. While Chinese [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=210.0s)]
*  ex-pats could renew government [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=212.0s)]
*  documents there like driver's licenses, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=214.0s)]
*  federal prosecutors [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=216.0s)]
*  said the main purpose of the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=218.0s)]
*  outpost was to target [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=220.0s)]
*  and harass Chinese dissidents. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=222.0s)]
*  They've done it in the Netherlands, they've done it in Canada, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=224.0s)]
*  but the idea that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=226.0s)]
*  you'd open a police station in another [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=228.0s)]
*  country, that's a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=230.0s)]
*  signal disrespect [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=232.0s)]
*  of the sovereignty of that nation. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=234.0s)]
*  After the station was shut down, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=236.0s)]
*  two Chinese Americans [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=238.0s)]
*  who allegedly opened it were [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=240.0s)]
*  charged with conspiracy to act [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=242.0s)]
*  as unregistered foreign agents [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=244.0s)]

*  within the U.S. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=260.0s)]
*  And one of the accused [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=262.0s)]

*  about who attended these meetings and what [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=366.0s)]
*  they said? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=368.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=370.0s)]
*  When did you start sharing that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=372.0s)]
*  information with China's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=374.0s)]

*  That is a very big misunderstanding. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=380.0s)]
*  In 2022, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=382.0s)]

*  by the U.S. Department of Justice [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=386.0s)]
*  for sharing dissident's names, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=388.0s)]
*  contact information, and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=390.0s)]
*  private conversations at the direction [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=392.0s)]
*  of the MSS for 17 years. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=394.0s)]
*  When we spoke with him in February [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=398.0s)]
*  through an interpreter, he was at times [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=400.0s)]
*  combative and disputed basic [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=402.0s)]
*  facts of his case. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=404.0s)]
*  So we eventually asked Mr. Wang [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=406.0s)]
*  point blank. Were you spying [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=408.0s)]
*  for the Chinese government? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=410.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=412.0s)]
*  Throughout the entire trial, they were [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=414.0s)]
*  very careful. They never used the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=416.0s)]
*  word spy. Just look at the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=418.0s)]
*  record and you'll see that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=420.0s)]
*  We did. And while [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=422.0s)]
*  lying to 60 Minutes may not be [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=424.0s)]
*  a crime, lying to the FBI [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=426.0s)]
*  is. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=428.0s)]
*  Mr. Wang repeatedly told [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=430.0s)]
*  federal agents he had no [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=432.0s)]
*  contact with the Ministry of State [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=434.0s)]
*  Security. But according to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=436.0s)]
*  federal prosecutors, he met [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=438.0s)]
*  with these MSS officers [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=440.0s)]
*  in China, and they offered him plane [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=442.0s)]
*  tickets and helped his family with [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=444.0s)]
*  a business dispute. In [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=446.0s)]
*  2021, someone claiming [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=448.0s)]

*  up at Mr. Wang's door [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=452.0s)]
*  to help delete communications from [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=454.0s)]
*  his computer that might incriminate [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=456.0s)]
*  him. Video from the encounter [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=458.0s)]
*  showed he welcomed the man's [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=460.0s)]
*  help. Unfortunately [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=462.0s)]
*  for Mr. Wang, the Chinese [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=464.0s)]
*  operative was actually an [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=466.0s)]
*  undercover FBI agent. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=468.0s)]
*  Mr. Wang [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=470.0s)]
*  had pled not guilty. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=472.0s)]
*  This past August, he was [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=474.0s)]

*  an unregistered foreign agent [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=484.0s)]
*  of China. Our position [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=486.0s)]
*  has always been that he never had [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=488.0s)]
*  the intent to be an [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=490.0s)]
*  agent of the Chinese government. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=492.0s)]
*  Mr. Wang's lawyers, Zachary [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=494.0s)]

*  their client was in touch with [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=498.0s)]
*  Chinese intelligence. But they [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=500.0s)]
*  argue he didn't break the law [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=502.0s)]
*  and claim FBI agents [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=504.0s)]
*  went after him once they were [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=506.0s)]
*  unable to recruit him for the [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=508.0s)]

*  roll over and identify [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=512.0s)]
*  handlers, hire up the food chain [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=514.0s)]
*  though he did not do so. And they [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=516.0s)]
*  felt a little vindictive and angry and frustrated [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=518.0s)]
*  about their inability to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=520.0s)]

*  actual espionage and [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=524.0s)]
*  they turned him into this fall guy. But when you look [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=526.0s)]
*  at the reality, he didn't have any [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=528.0s)]
*  access to secret, top [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=530.0s)]

*  And collecting that information for whom? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=626.0s)]
*  For Beijing. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=628.0s)]
*  Why do you think China goes to such [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=630.0s)]
*  lengths to spy [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=632.0s)]
*  on pro-democracy [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=634.0s)]
*  activists here in the U.S.? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=636.0s)]
*  This is their tactics, right? They try [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=638.0s)]
*  to silence you, harass [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=640.0s)]
*  you, or intimidate you so that [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=642.0s)]
*  you stop what you're doing. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=644.0s)]
*  They want to cripple me and cripple my [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=646.0s)]
*  ability to advocate for Hong Kong. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=648.0s)]
*  Anna Kwok now [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=650.0s)]
*  runs the pro-democracy organization [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=652.0s)]
*  that Anna Young Chung [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=654.0s)]
*  co-founded. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=656.0s)]
*  Because of her outspoken activism, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=658.0s)]
*  the Hong Kong government [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=660.0s)]
*  has placed a $130,000 [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=662.0s)]
*  bounty on her [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=664.0s)]
*  head. So every single day I [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=666.0s)]
*  wake up, I open my social media, and [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=668.0s)]
*  then I would see people talking about how [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=670.0s)]
*  if I keep talking here [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=672.0s)]
*  in the United States, they will come [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=674.0s)]
*  kidnap me and take [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=676.0s)]
*  my body to the Chinese consulate so [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=678.0s)]
*  that they can send me back to China. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=680.0s)]
*  How are you viewed by the Chinese government? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=682.0s)]
*  If I do go back to Hong Kong, it's going to be [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=684.0s)]
*  life imprisonment. So basically [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=686.0s)]
*  they see me as a traitor, as [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=688.0s)]
*  someone who betrays the Chinese [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=690.0s)]
*  government and the Hong Kong government. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=692.0s)]
*  And what's the crime you've committed? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=694.0s)]
*  They think that fighting for democracy, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=696.0s)]
*  wanting a say in [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=698.0s)]
*  our own future, is a crime. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=700.0s)]
*  The United States is known as the land of [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=702.0s)]
*  the free. Do you feel free here? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=704.0s)]
*  Honestly, with China's long arm [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=706.0s)]
*  repression, it's difficult to feel free [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=708.0s)]
*  anywhere in the world. The thing about the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=710.0s)]
*  Chinese government is that you can leave [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=712.0s)]
*  the country, you can leave the territory, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=714.0s)]
*  but you can never actually leave [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=716.0s)]
*  their governance. After we met her, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=718.0s)]
*  Anna Kwok's father and brother [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=720.0s)]

*  political asylum in the U.S. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=726.0s)]
*  In March, the Trump administration [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=728.0s)]
*  announced sanctions against officials [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=730.0s)]
*  in Hong Kong who have targeted her [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=732.0s)]
*  and 18 other [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=734.0s)]
*  prominent activists living abroad. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=736.0s)]
*  As for Shujun Wang, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=738.0s)]
*  on April 14th, a federal judge [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=740.0s)]
*  sentenced him to three years [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=742.0s)]
*  supervised release. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=744.0s)]
*  He spared Mr. Wang prison time [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=746.0s)]
*  because of health problems, including [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=748.0s)]
*  cognitive decline. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=750.0s)]
*  But the judge reiterated he had [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=752.0s)]
*  committed serious crimes against [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=754.0s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=756.0s)]
*  He was an agent. He worked with the Chinese [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=758.0s)]
*  government to identify targets for them [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=760.0s)]
*  to surveil and compromise. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=762.0s)]
*  According to China analyst Jim [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=764.0s)]
*  Lewis, there's still no [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=766.0s)]
*  substitute for on-the-ground [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=768.0s)]
*  human intelligence, even if [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=770.0s)]
*  Mr. Wang was [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=772.0s)]
*  an expendable asset for China's [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=774.0s)]
*  top spy agency. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=776.0s)]
*  Not exactly James Bond. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=778.0s)]
*  Definitely not James Bond. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=780.0s)]
*  Definitely not. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=782.0s)]
*  That's the scary part though, is that [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=784.0s)]
*  the Chinese are very good. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=786.0s)]
*  And so he was not number one [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=788.0s)]
*  on the list of [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=790.0s)]
*  assets to protect. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=792.0s)]
*  That means there are other assets who are being protected. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=794.0s)]
*  In April of last year, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=804.0s)]
*  a career American ambassador [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=806.0s)]

*  the highest levels of security [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=816.0s)]
*  clearance. For 40 years, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=818.0s)]
*  he was a covert agent. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=820.0s)]
*  Before Ambassador Rocha was exposed, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=822.0s)]
*  there was another prolific Cuban spy [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=824.0s)]
*  named Ana Montes, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=826.0s)]
*  a Pentagon official who was the lead [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=828.0s)]
*  analyst on Cuba policy. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=830.0s)]
*  She spied for 17 [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=832.0s)]
*  years. But Cuban spycraft [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=834.0s)]
*  isn't just a relic of the Cold [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=836.0s)]

*  reported in 2024, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=844.0s)]
*  Cuba's main export isn't [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=846.0s)]

*  of damage [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=960.0s)]
*  that he did to national security? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=962.0s)]
*  Manuel Rocha did enormous damage [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=964.0s)]

*  Brian Lattel was the CIA's [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=968.0s)]
*  top Cuba analyst at the height [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=970.0s)]

*  in the 1980s, Rocha cold [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=974.0s)]
*  called and struck up a professional [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=976.0s)]

*  What can you tell me about the trade [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=994.0s)]
*  craft that Cuba uses? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=996.0s)]
*  They do it very, very well [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=998.0s)]
*  in mostly rudimentary [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1000.0s)]

*  and success has been in the dimension [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1008.0s)]
*  of human intelligence. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1010.0s)]
*  Their officers, their intelligence agents [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1012.0s)]
*  and officers are very, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1014.0s)]
*  very good. They know [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1016.0s)]
*  their trade craft. They practice [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1018.0s)]
*  it with great skill [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1020.0s)]
*  and with discipline. And [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1022.0s)]
*  when they recruit, they're very [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1024.0s)]
*  careful about how they recruit and how they [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1026.0s)]

*  do with the information it gets [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1030.0s)]
*  from all these spies? They have [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1032.0s)]
*  no scruples about sharing the information [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1034.0s)]
*  or perhaps marketing it, selling [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1036.0s)]
*  it to other [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1038.0s)]
*  countries. The Russians, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1040.0s)]
*  maybe the Chinese, if they [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1042.0s)]

*  Tehran, it would be of interest [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1050.0s)]
*  to those countries. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1052.0s)]
*  That was this man's job when he was a [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1054.0s)]
*  Cuban intelligence officer, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1056.0s)]

*  Cuba shared that information [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1066.0s)]
*  with enemies of the United States, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1068.0s)]

*  Countries like the Soviet Union for years, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1072.0s)]
*  countries like North Korea, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1074.0s)]

*  information about the operation of the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1078.0s)]
*  Defense Department. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1080.0s)]
*  You say Cuba may not have the weapons, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1082.0s)]
*  Cuba may not have the arms, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1084.0s)]
*  but they sell these secrets [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1086.0s)]
*  to the enemies of the United States. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1088.0s)]
*  The strongest enemies of the United States [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1092.0s)]
*  all of that was what made me realize [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1094.0s)]
*  this is a battle between good and evil. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1096.0s)]
*  Cuba was at the service of all [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1098.0s)]
*  the enemies of the United States. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1100.0s)]
*  After Jose Cohen [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1102.0s)]
*  set foot on U.S. soil, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1104.0s)]

*  with the FBI. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1108.0s)]

*  100 suspected Cuban agents [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1112.0s)]

*  and ultimately one very important [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1116.0s)]
*  spy. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1118.0s)]
*  Cohen handed over an increasing [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1120.0s)]

*  and up the East Coast as far north as [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1150.0s)]

*  Over the course of her career, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1330.0s)]
*  she became such an expert [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1332.0s)]
*  that she was known in the intelligence community [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1334.0s)]
*  as the queen of Cuba. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1336.0s)]
*  All the while, she was exposing [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1338.0s)]
*  national secrets to Havana. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1340.0s)]
*  The FBI surveilled her for [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1342.0s)]
*  a year before her arrest, as [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1344.0s)]
*  she walked to work and called her Cuban [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1346.0s)]
*  handler. By that time, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1348.0s)]
*  she had revealed the existence of a [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1350.0s)]
*  top-secret satellite program [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1352.0s)]
*  used by the U.S. to spy on other [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1354.0s)]
*  countries. She also gave [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1356.0s)]
*  Havana the names of 450 [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1358.0s)]

*  officers stationed in Cuba. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1366.0s)]
*  And she got away with it [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1368.0s)]
*  for 17 years, until [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1370.0s)]

*  Special Agent Peter Lapp and his [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1376.0s)]
*  partner Stephen McCoy. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1378.0s)]
*  She didn't fit the profile of a typical spy? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1380.0s)]
*  No. Being a woman [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1382.0s)]
*  is incredibly unique, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1384.0s)]
*  so it doesn't fit that typical [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1386.0s)]
*  what we would look for [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1388.0s)]
*  in a spy, which is mostly men. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1390.0s)]
*  Montes pleaded guilty to [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1392.0s)]
*  espionage, and in exchange for [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1394.0s)]
*  not spending the rest of her life in prison, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1396.0s)]
*  she agreed to tell the FBI [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1398.0s)]
*  everything she had done. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1400.0s)]
*  I wouldn't mind at all meeting [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1402.0s)]
*  two Fridays a month. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1404.0s)]
*  Through a public records request, we obtained [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1406.0s)]
*  this footage, seen here for the first [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1408.0s)]
*  time, of Montes wearing [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1410.0s)]
*  prison stripes, speaking with FBI [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1412.0s)]
*  investigators. Citing [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1414.0s)]
*  Montes' right to privacy, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1416.0s)]
*  the FBI denied our request for [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1418.0s)]
*  the recorded audio of their interviews. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1420.0s)]
*  But we obtained a declassified [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1422.0s)]
*  transcript of the first day [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1424.0s)]
*  where Montes described how deep in [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1426.0s)]
*  she was. She said, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1428.0s)]
*  Ever since I started helping the [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1430.0s)]
*  I don't really know how a person does it [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1432.0s)]
*  without feeling morally bound. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1434.0s)]
*  It's a full commitment, mentally, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1436.0s)]
*  physically, emotionally. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1438.0s)]
*  I feel that what I did was morally right, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1440.0s)]
*  that I was faithful to principles [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1442.0s)]
*  that were right. Montes [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1444.0s)]
*  told the agents her only regret [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1446.0s)]
*  was that she was forced to cooperate [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1448.0s)]
*  with the FBI as part of her plea deal. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1450.0s)]
*  It's tearing me up, she said, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1452.0s)]
*  but if the only way I'm going to see [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1454.0s)]
*  my family again, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1456.0s)]
*  it's the only way. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1458.0s)]
*  Agent Lapp sat across from Ana Montes [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1460.0s)]
*  in the interrogation room for seven [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1462.0s)]
*  months. He said one of the most [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1464.0s)]
*  sobering moments was when she said [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1466.0s)]
*  how far she would have been willing to go [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1468.0s)]
*  for the Cubans in the week after [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1470.0s)]
*  9-11. She said [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1472.0s)]
*  if the Cubans asked me to [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1474.0s)]
*  provide them with intelligence [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1476.0s)]
*  about what we were doing in Afghanistan, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1478.0s)]
*  I absolutely would have [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1480.0s)]
*  done that. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1482.0s)]
*  And if men and [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1484.0s)]
*  women were killed, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1486.0s)]
*  men and women were killed [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1488.0s)]
*  as a result of my intelligence [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1490.0s)]
*  in Afghanistan, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1492.0s)]
*  she told us that's the risk that they took. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1494.0s)]
*  What was the extent of the damage [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1496.0s)]
*  that she did? I do [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1498.0s)]
*  think she's in that [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1500.0s)]

*  some of the most notorious spies [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1504.0s)]
*  in American history, and I think the damage [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1506.0s)]
*  that she did was [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1508.0s)]
*  incredibly significant. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1510.0s)]
*  After serving 20 years in federal [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1512.0s)]

*  Saad Al-Jabri was number two in Saudi intelligence and he was among the best friends America had [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1607.6s)]
*  against terrorism. Now Saad is asking America's help. Truth is hard to triangulate among spies, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1614.24s)]
*  despots in the Middle East and as we first reported in October, you're going to hear that [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1622.16s)]
*  Saad Al-Jabri may not be spotless, but as a spymaster Saad says he has one more favor for [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1628.0s)]
*  America, a warning about a prince with the power to trouble the world. I am here to sound the alarm [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1636.0s)]
*  about a psychopath killer in the Middle East with infinite resources who poses threat to his people [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1647.12s)]
*  to the Americans and to the planet. Saad Al-Jabri is talking about Mohamed bin Salman who seized [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1657.44s)]
*  power behind the back of the man greeting President Obama. That's Mohamed bin Nayef [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1667.1200000000001s)]
*  then heir to the throne, but in 2017 Nayef was arrested by Prince Mohamed bin Salman. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1674.48s)]
*  A psychopath? A psychopath with no empathy, doesn't feel emotion, never learned from his experience [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1682.8s)]
*  and we have witnessed atrocities and crimes committed by this killer. A source from US [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1694.48s)]
*  intelligence told us Saad Al-Jabri would never show up for this interview. He'd lived too long [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1703.6799999999998s)]
*  in a silent profession. The fact that he did show up is a measure of his desperation. Saad is 63, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1709.6s)]
*  married, eight children. He started as a cop but rose to the top of Saudi intelligence [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1718.24s)]
*  and earned a PhD in the science of artificial intelligence. He could be seen in the Oval Office [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1724.6399999999999s)]
*  with American ambassadors, the US military command and with Michael Morell, former acting director [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1731.6s)]
*  of the CIA. I'm a big admirer. I found Dr. Saad to be extraordinarily bright. I found him to be [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1739.28s)]
*  incredibly loyal to his country. Would you say honorable? Honorable, yes absolutely. But in 2017, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1747.84s)]
*  Saad found himself on the wrong side of Prince Mohamed's coup. The deposed Prince Nayef was Saad's [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1756.24s)]
*  boss. Saad fled to Canada where he remains and refuses to return. Now Prince Mohamed is making [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1763.52s)]
*  Saad's family pay. The very day of the coup, two of his children were barred from leaving the [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1771.44s)]
*  kingdom. This is his daughter Sarah and his son Omar. Both plan to be in American colleges. They [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1778.0s)]
*  are now in Saudi prisons. Next, the family says Prince Mohamed targeted Saad's son-in-law. They [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1790.96s)]
*  claim the son-in-law was kidnapped in a third country and returned to the kingdom. The first [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1798.96s)]
*  night he was kidnapped, he received more than 100 lashes. He was tortured. He was beaten on his back, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1804.88s)]
*  on his legs. Khalid Al-Jabri is Saad's eldest son. What was he told he was being detained for? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1813.6s)]
*  He was being told that he was detained and tortured as a proxy for his father-in-law, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1822.08s)]
*  meaning my dad. They even asked him a question, who do you think we should arrest and torture [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1826.9599999999998s)]
*  so Dr. Saad can come back to the kingdom? Their story recalls Washington Post columnist Jamal [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1832.9599999999998s)]
*  Khashoggi, a critic of Prince Mohamed. In 2018, a year after his coup, U.S. intelligence says Prince [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1839.52s)]
*  Mohamed sent a team to Turkey to lure Khashoggi to a Saudi consulate and dismember him. Saad told [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1847.84s)]
*  us that days later, before Khashoggi's murder was known to the public, he received a warning. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1856.08s)]
*  A friend in a Middle Eastern intelligence service said another hit team was headed for Saad in Canada. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1864.0s)]
*  And the warning I received, don't be in a proximity of any Saudi mission in Canada. Don't go to the [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1871.6s)]
*  consulate. Don't go to the embassy. Why? They dismembered the guy, they kill him. You are in the [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1878.16s)]
*  top of the list. Saad says a six-person team landed at the Ottawa airport in mid-October 2018. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1885.28s)]
*  He says members of the team lied to customs about knowing one another and they carried suspicious [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1894.32s)]
*  equipment for DNA analysis. The team was deported. Canada seems to confirm at least part of this [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1900.3999999999999s)]
*  story saying, we are aware of incidents in which foreign actors have attempted to threaten those [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1908.56s)]
*  living in Canada. It is completely unacceptable. Is that the way intelligence organizations work [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1915.36s)]
*  in this world? It's not a norm in this world. It's a norm for countries like Russia and North Korea. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1922.96s)]
*  It's not a norm for almost any other country in the world. Do you think Mohamed bin Salman fears you? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1929.52s)]
*  He fears my information. Saad told us his information includes a 2014 meeting between Prince [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1939.12s)]
*  Mohamed on the left and the then head of intelligence Mohamed bin Nayef. It was three years before the [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1947.52s)]
*  coup. Saad claims the young prince boasted to Nayef that he could kill the sitting king, Abdullah, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1955.28s)]
*  to clear the throne for his own father. And he told him, I want to assassinate King Abdullah. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1963.68s)]
*  I get a poisoned ring from Russia. It's enough for me just to shake hand with him and he will be done. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1972.0s)]
*  A poison ring from Russia? That's what he said, whether he's just bragging or but he said [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1980.0800000000002s)]
*  that and we took it seriously. By we, Saad means Saudi intelligence took it seriously. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1987.44s)]
*  The alleged threat, he says, was handled within the royal family. Saad told us he watched the [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=1994.0800000000002s)]
*  meeting on a video recording. Does this video recording still exist? Yes. I know where it is [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2000.8s)]
*  now. I know there are two cupboards of that. I know where they are. Prince Mohamed is 36 and [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2008.0800000000002s)]
*  wields unlimited power on behalf of his ailing 86 year old father, King Salman. The prince is [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2015.44s)]
*  admired by some for allowing women to drive, permitting movie theaters and disbanding the [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2023.04s)]
*  religious police who once assaulted couples for holding hands. There's two groups of people in [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2029.76s)]
*  Saudi Arabia. There are those who are very happy with Mohammed bin Salman, the 70% of the population [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2036.48s)]
*  that's under 30. He is not popular with the old guard, with the royal family because he changed [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2045.84s)]
*  the system. But much of that change has been reckless. His war in Yemen has killed thousands [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2054.0s)]
*  of civilians in what the UN says may be war crimes. He invited Lebanon's leader to visit [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2061.36s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, took him hostage and forced him to resign. He detained hundreds of potential rivals [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2067.92s)]
*  until they signed over their wealth, jailed women calling for human rights and murdered Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2075.36s)]
*  I expect to be killed one day because this guy will not rest off until he sees me dead. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2083.36s)]
*  But what does America owe Saad Al-Jabri? We asked former CIA Acting Director and CBS News [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2091.36s)]
*  consultant Michael Morell, who worked closely with Saad from 2010 to 2013. Is it too much to [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2098.96s)]
*  say that Saad may have saved American lives? He absolutely, Dr. Saad absolutely saved American [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2106.1600000000003s)]
*  lives. He saved Saudi lives, many of them, and he saved American lives. Can you name any of those [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2113.76s)]
*  cases? The one I can talk about is the so-called printer cartridge plot. In 2010, Al-Qaeda hid [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2120.08s)]
*  bombs in two desktop printers. They were in the air as cargo headed to the U.S. on two planes, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2128.3199999999997s)]
*  perhaps intended to explode over American cities. But thanks to intelligence relayed by Saad Al-Jabri, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2136.48s)]
*  the bombs were intercepted during layovers. Are there any other examples of times that Saad had [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2144.08s)]
*  saved American lives? There are. What are they? I can't talk about them because they're still [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2152.16s)]
*  classified. Are there several? There are many, many. While working in that classified world, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2157.68s)]
*  Saad Al-Jabri became enormously wealthy. Prince Mohammed typically accuses potential rivals of [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2168.72s)]
*  corruption, and Saudi entities are suing Saad in the U.S. and Canada, claiming he stole as much as [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2176.0s)]
*  $500 million from the counterterrorism budget. Did you steal the money? No. If you didn't steal the [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2184.0s)]
*  money, how did you get so rich? You know, I have served a royal manakee in a close approximately [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2192.56s)]
*  for two decades. Three kings, four crowns, they've been nice to me. They've been very generous. It's [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2204.08s)]
*  a tradition in Saudi Arabia, royal family. They take care of people around them. I don't know if [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2213.84s)]
*  Dr. Saad was corrupt in any way. I wouldn't be surprised if he wasn't because he's such an [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2220.48s)]
*  honorable man, but I also wouldn't be surprised if he was because everybody, to some extent, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2228.72s)]
*  had their hand in the kitty, and King Abdullah allowed it, permitted it. But in the Saudi lawsuit [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2235.44s)]
*  against Saad, the Canadian judge has said there is, quote, overwhelming evidence of fraud, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2242.96s)]
*  and so she has frozen his assets as the case moves forward. The Saudi government declined an [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2250.0s)]
*  interview, but in a statement it said, Saad Al-Jabri is a discredited former government official with a [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2256.56s)]
*  long history of fabricating and creating distractions to hide the financial crimes he committed. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2263.76s)]
*  He implies that stealing was acceptable at the time, but it wasn't acceptable nor legal then, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2271.12s)]
*  and it isn't now. Saad says he's thinking only of his imprisoned children. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2277.7599999999998s)]
*  I have to speak out. I am appealing to the American people and to the American administration [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2284.7999999999997s)]
*  to help me to release those children and to restore their life. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2291.68s)]
*  Saad Al-Jabri told us he's recorded a death video that reveals more secrets of the royal family and [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2296.3199999999997s)]
*  some of the United States. He gave us a short silent clip of the video which he told us, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2303.6s)]
*  quote, could be released if he is killed. It includes a message to Omar and Sarah, his imprisoned [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2310.24s)]
*  children. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2318.24s)]
*  Does the United States as a country owe anything to Saad? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2330.56s)]
*  It's been hard for presidents to stand up to Mohammed bin Salman. Neither the Trump nor Biden [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2348.24s)]
*  administrations publicly sanctioned him after Khashoggi. Saudi oil isn't as important as it [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2360.24s)]
*  once was, but countering Iran is, which has led to a certain tolerance of a menacing prince. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2366.56s)]
*  Kevin Mallory was a down on his luck former clandestine case officer for the CIA when he was [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2378.4799999999996s)]
*  approached by a man the Department of Justice believes was a Chinese spy. Officials say Mallory [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2383.7599999999998s)]
*  was a prime target for recruitment. He was out of work, three months behind on his mortgage, and [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2389.3599999999997s)]
*  thousands of dollars in debt. But as we first reported in December and as the Chinese would [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2394.9599999999996s)]
*  discover, Kevin Mallory was a Chinese spy. He was a Chinese spy. He was a Chinese spy. He was a [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2400.16s)]
*  Chinese spy. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2406.56s)]
*  But as the Chinese would discover, Kevin Mallory wasn't exactly James Bond. The Department of [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2408.56s)]
*  Justice agreed to show us how they caught Mr. Mallory and why they believe his recruitment by [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2413.6s)]
*  China is part of a massive clandestine campaign to steal not just national security secrets from [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2418.88s)]
*  the U.S. government, but industrial and technological secrets from American companies. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2425.04s)]
*  The man standing on the right in the yellow shirt is Kevin Mallory, who once held a top secret [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2431.28s)]
*  security clearance while working for the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency. Footage from a [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2436.6400000000003s)]
*  surveillance camera at a Virginia FedEx store in April of 2017 caught him as he prepared to hand [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2442.2400000000002s)]
*  a clerk stacks of classified documents to be scanned onto an SD card, the kind that can be [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2448.56s)]

*  So this is the rare moment, right, in an investigation and an espionage case where we [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2456.8799999999997s)]
*  actually have video footage of the individual preparing the classified material for transmission [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2461.04s)]
*  to the Foreign Intelligence Service. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2467.04s)]
*  We watch the tape with Ryan Gaynor, the FBI's supervisory special agent who investigated Mallory [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2469.04s)]
*  and Jennifer Jelly, who prosecuted the case against him for the National Security Division [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2475.12s)]
*  of the Department of Justice. They say Kevin Mallory sent national security secrets to a Chinese [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2479.9199999999996s)]
*  spy on a covert communication device. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2485.92s)]
*  So here you see him talking with the store clerk about the scanning job, and throughout this video [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2488.96s)]
*  you see little pops of yellow, little yellow pieces of paper that flash by when he's showing [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2493.76s)]
*  the documents. That was important for us because the document that he successfully passed consisted [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2498.16s)]
*  of a typed up white piece of paper, that was the classified information, followed by two yellow [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2503.04s)]
*  sheets of paper with his handwriting on them. And here you can see... [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2508.8s)]
*  So that's those are the yellow sheets? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2512.2400000000002s)]
*  You can see the yellow sheets going through that scanning process. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2513.44s)]
*  Prosecutors say some of the information Mallory sent could have revealed the identity of a couple [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2516.56s)]
*  who had secretly spied on China for the U.S. It was a very personal betrayal. Mallory had [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2521.84s)]
*  supervised the couple years before. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2528.56s)]
*  He was betraying people. This is people's lives at stake. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2530.88s)]
*  Correct. These were documents that specifically talked about human beings. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2533.6s)]
*  Whose lives could be in danger. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2536.7200000000003s)]
*  If they had traveled to China, they could have been arrested. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2538.48s)]
*  At the time he gave the information to the Chinese intelligence officer, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2541.12s)]
*  he knew they were planning on traveling to China. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2545.68s)]
*  John Demers is the top official in charge of the Department of Justice's National Security Division, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2548.56s)]
*  which helps guard the U.S. against terrorism, cyber attacks, and espionage. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2554.08s)]
*  He's responsible for coordinating activities across law enforcement and U.S. intelligence agencies. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2559.04s)]
*  He says Kevin Mallory's recruitment is just one of many efforts by the Chinese Ministry [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2565.7599999999998s)]
*  of State Security, or MSS, to spy on the United States. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2570.8s)]
*  What is MSS? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2575.1200000000003s)]
*  So MSS is the principal intelligence agency of the Chinese government. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2576.4s)]
*  And in rough terms, it is like the CIA and FBI put together. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2581.76s)]
*  Their capabilities are world class. They have cyber capabilities. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2587.52s)]
*  They have expertise in turning people into cooperators. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2591.44s)]
*  They have all of the tools and expertise of a very capable intelligence organization. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2595.52s)]
*  John Demers says Kevin Mallory hadn't worked for any U.S. intelligence agency in five years, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2602.4s)]
*  but he was still of interest to China. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2608.1600000000003s)]
*  He spoke Mandarin, was desperate for money, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2610.32s)]
*  and had classified information he might be willing to sell. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2612.96s)]
*  You're looking for people who will be willing to work with you for one reason or another. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2616.48s)]
*  You start very slowly. You start to see what information they're willing to share with you [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2621.92s)]
*  originally, innocuous information, then something maybe slightly more sensitive, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2626.32s)]
*  and so forth. And that relationship develops over time. It's a patient process. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2630.6400000000003s)]
*  It's a grooming of an intelligence asset. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2636.08s)]
*  It's a grooming, and it's a constant testing to see what the person is willing to do. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2638.56s)]
*  The Chinese didn't reach out to Kevin Mallory in a dark alley like in a movie. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2642.7200000000003s)]
*  They made contact with him like any job recruiter would. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2647.52s)]
*  They sent him a message on the career networking site LinkedIn. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2650.96s)]
*  What could the Chinese tell from reading his LinkedIn page? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2654.8s)]
*  When you look at this LinkedIn page, it's very clear immediately that he worked in national [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2657.68s)]
*  security, that he had the type of background that the Chinese intelligence services are [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2662.08s)]
*  most interested in. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2665.84s)]
*  He's got a national security, military, international relations, counterterrorism, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2666.88s)]
*  security clearance, dispute resolution. This is a signpost to I was a former intelligence official. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2670.96s)]
*  And it led to what you would expect. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2676.4s)]
*  Mallory ended up in contact with this man, who called himself Michael Yang, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2678.56s)]
*  and claimed to be an employee at a Chinese think tank. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2682.96s)]
*  So he's a Chinese intelligence officer. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2686.2400000000002s)]
*  We believe him to be a Chinese intelligence officer. And more importantly, Mr. Mallory, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2688.16s)]
*  when meeting with him, believed him to be an intelligence officer. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2692.16s)]
*  Over the next several weeks, Michael Yang paid Mallory $25,000 to come to Shanghai twice, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2695.44s)]
*  and Mallory reached out to former colleagues at the CIA, asking to be put in touch with [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2702.16s)]
*  people who had current intelligence on China. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2707.36s)]
*  Prosecutors say his former colleagues grew suspicious and reported him to CIA security, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2711.1200000000003s)]
*  putting him on the radar of law enforcement. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2717.2000000000003s)]
*  When Mallory returned from his second trip to China, he was stopped by customs at Chicago's [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2720.08s)]
*  O'Hare airport. He had lied on this form about how much money he was carrying, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2724.96s)]
*  more than $16,000 in cash. And agents discovered this box with a phone in it. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2729.92s)]
*  Mallory claimed it was a gift for his wife, but it was actually a covert communication device [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2736.24s)]
*  that had been given to him by Chinese intelligence. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2741.6s)]
*  This looks just like a regular phone. What makes it a covert communication device? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2744.56s)]
*  So it's not so much the hardware. The phone itself had a unique piece of software installed on it, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2749.68s)]
*  designed to allow secure communication, both in text and also the secure transmission of documents [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2755.2s)]
*  later. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2760.24s)]
*  You might think a former CIA officer would be cautious about the text he sends to a Chinese [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2760.72s)]
*  spy. But Kevin Mallory was remarkably direct, complaining about the money he was paid and the [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2766.08s)]
*  risk he was taking. Your object is to gain information, he told Michael Yang, and my object [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2772.3199999999997s)]
*  is to be paid for. I'll destroy all electronic records after you confirm receipt, Mallory wrote [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2778.3999999999996s)]
*  to Yang. I already destroyed the paper records. I cannot keep these around. Too dangerous. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2784.3199999999997s)]
*  At this point, all the risk is on me. So he says, I'm taking all the risk. But then he goes on a [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2789.92s)]
*  few bubbles later to actually try to transmit additional information to the Chinese. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2794.48s)]
*  But technology wasn't Mallory's strong suit. He complained to Michael Yang that the phone [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2799.12s)]
*  wasn't working properly. This system sucks. It's too cumbersome, he wrote. I put all these messages [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2804.4s)]
*  and then and you can't read them because you're not logged in the same time. That's a poor system. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2811.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I reverse at this point, prosecutors say Mallory was scared. He'd been stopped at [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2816.48s)]
*  customs and he feared the CIA and FBI were on to him. Prosecutors say he decided to come up with [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2821.76s)]
*  a cover story and reached out to the CIA telling them he thought he was being recruited by Chinese [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2828.48s)]
*  spies. The CIA called him in for an interview. My judgment is, and we haven't got through the [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2834.08s)]
*  conversation, that these guys work for Chinese intelligence. So my sense is that they are looking [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2840.32s)]
*  for government secrets, US government secrets at some level. In this meeting, Mallory admitted the [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2847.6800000000003s)]
*  phone was a covert communication device given to him by the Chinese. But prosecutors say he lied [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2852.88s)]
*  about the classified documents he'd already sent. Did you send them anything on that phone? I sent [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2859.36s)]
*  some tests of some sort just to see if I could do it right and I couldn't figure it out. I [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2865.28s)]
*  messed that up. He's trying to control the narrative. So what you have here likely is an [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2869.52s)]
*  attempt to steer the story to explain away some of the more alerting pieces while not admitting to [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2874.88s)]
*  the criminal activity of providing the classified information to the foreign intelligence services. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2880.08s)]
*  We now know that at this point in time, Kevin Mallory has successfully sent the classified table [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2884.4s)]
*  of contents, the classified white paper, and tried to send several other documents unsuccessfully. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2888.96s)]
*  Mallory offered to bring in the phone to be examined by the CIA, confident that all his [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2894.56s)]
*  messages to Michael Yang had automatically been deleted. So he believes everything he sent has [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2899.7599999999998s)]
*  disappeared from the device. So that's why he's willing to bring the device in. We have every [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2905.68s)]
*  reason to believe that he believed at the time that those communications would be gone. Two weeks [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2911.2799999999997s)]
*  later, Mallory arrived at a hotel room in Ashburn, Virginia for a second meeting with the CIA. When he [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2916.32s)]
*  got there, the FBI was waiting for him along with a computer forensic examiner. He agreed to show [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2922.72s)]
*  them how the phone worked. When he goes to demonstrate it up on the screen where he expects to [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2929.52s)]
*  have his whole chat history basically deleted, up on the screen comes some of the chat history. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2934.3999999999996s)]
*  The FBI recorded the meeting. I'm not trying to get this much. So you may comment that you're [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2939.6s)]
*  surprised that there was this much there. Right, because in the past, maybe it's the screen size, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2947.04s)]
*  because some of it's just disappeared. One of the most incriminating messages that appeared on the [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2954.88s)]
*  phone was Mallory planning another trip to China. I can also come in the middle of June, he wrote. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2959.2799999999997s)]
*  I can bring the remainder of the documents I have at that time. From the FBI perspective, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2965.2799999999997s)]
*  this is a pivotal moment in the investigation. Four weeks later, the FBI arrested Kevin Mallory [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2970.4s)]
*  and searched his home. Hidden in the back of this closet in a junk drawer, agents discovered an SD [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2976.72s)]
*  card wrapped in tin foil on which he'd placed eight secret and top secret documents, the same [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2983.2799999999997s)]
*  ones he scanned at that FedEx store in April. It is our belief that it was intention to take this [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2989.6s)]
*  SD card to China to provide to them. Does the Mallory case fit a pattern that you're seeing [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=2995.68s)]
*  coming from Chinese intelligence? Yes, we currently have three pending cases against [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3001.2s)]
*  former intelligence officers and they're alleged to have been spying on behalf of the Chinese. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3007.4399999999996s)]
*  It's hard to overstate how unusual it is to have three cases like this ongoing. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3012.72s)]
*  It's not unusual, it's unprecedented. To me, it's disappointing and it's really hurtful, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3018.08s)]
*  I think, to everyone to know that we still have people who are willing to betray the U.S. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3022.7999999999997s)]
*  for a few dollars. Bill Avenina is director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3027.92s)]
*  a division of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. He serves as the U.S. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3033.7599999999998s)]
*  government's top counterintelligence official. When it comes to espionage against the United States, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3038.56s)]
*  does China pose the greatest threat or Russia? When it comes to espionage, China poses the [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3043.68s)]

*  you include economic espionage, industrial espionage, it's not even in the same ballgame. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3053.6s)]
*  When most people think of espionage, they think of somebody in a trench coat trying to steal a [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3058.7999999999997s)]
*  state's secret. What's happening now with China, it's not just about state secrets, it's about [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3062.56s)]
*  technological secrets. That's the prize that China wants. That's correct. It's trade secrets, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3069.52s)]
*  proprietary data, intelligence, emerging technology, nanotechnology, hybrid, anything that they can see [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3073.92s)]
*  that is the future, supercomputing, encryption. Those are the issues that they look at and they [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3079.92s)]
*  have a prioritized schedule that they look at and they send people forward to go collect that data. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3085.76s)]
*  John Demers of the Justice Department's National Security Division says since 2011, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3091.52s)]
*  more than 90 percent of the economic espionage cases they've charged have involved China, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3096.88s)]
*  which has stolen secrets about everything from genetically modified rice seeds to wind turbine [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3102.56s)]
*  technology. This is a persistent campaign you're seeing. Yes, very persistent, very sophisticated, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3108.08s)]
*  very well resourced, very patient, and very broad in scope. Demers says Chinese operatives have [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3114.48s)]
*  intensified their efforts on industries critical to Chinese President Xi Jinping's Made in China [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3121.04s)]

*  artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and other cutting-edge industries. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3133.84s)]
*  I think some people who see this are going to think, well, this is something the U.S. must do as well. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3138.48s)]
*  The U.S. intelligence community doesn't take trade secrets from foreign companies for the benefit of [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3144.2400000000002s)]
*  American companies. That doesn't happen. This is not something that we do. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3149.84s)]
*  As for former CIA officer Kevin Mallory, he continues to deny sending any classified [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3153.28s)]
*  information to the Chinese. Last June, a jury in Virginia found him guilty of conspiracy under [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3159.2s)]
*  the Espionage Act and lying to the FBI. In May, Mallory was sentenced to 20 years in prison. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3166.08s)]
*  Last month, the head of NORAD and NORTHCOM, the military commands that defend North America, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3182.56s)]
*  told Congress some of those mysterious drones seen flying inside the United States may indeed [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3188.72s)]
*  have been spying. He did not say for whom. 60 Minutes has been looking into a series of eerily [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3195.2799999999997s)]
*  similar incidents going back years, including those attention-getting flyovers in New Jersey [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3202.0s)]
*  recently. In each, drones first appeared over restricted military or civilian sites, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3207.6s)]
*  coming and going, often literally under the radar. The wake-up call came just over a year ago [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3214.16s)]
*  when drones invaded the skies above Langley Air Force Base in Virginia over 17 nights, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3221.2s)]
*  forcing the relocation of our most advanced fighter jets. Our story starts with an eyewitness [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3227.52s)]
*  and an iPhone. Close around seven o'clock, I would say, I started seeing these reddish-orange [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3234.0s)]
*  flashing lights that were starting to come in from the Virginia Beach area. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3242.2400000000002s)]
*  It began slowly, like one at a time. Jonathan Butner's close encounter with drones came on [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3246.88s)]
*  December 14, 2023. He was at his family's cabin on the James River in Virginia, about 100 miles [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3253.04s)]
*  south of Washington, D.C., with a commanding view of several military installations across the water. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3261.04s)]
*  They started really coming in, like almost like on a conveyor belt. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3267.92s)]
*  How many in total? I probably saw upwards of 40 [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3271.92s)]
*  plus. When I first saw that, I was like, dude, those are going directly over Langley Air Force Base. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3275.52s)]
*  Langley is one of the most critical air bases on the East Coast, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3282.48s)]
*  home to dozens of F-22 Raptors, the most advanced stealth fighter jets ever built. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3288.7200000000003s)]
*  Butner says from his perch, he has seen it all. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3295.84s)]
*  I'm very familiar with all the different types of military craft. We have Black Hawks, we have [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3299.28s)]
*  the F-22s, and these were like nothing I've ever seen. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3304.0s)]
*  Butner took these iPhone videos of the objects coming and going for nearly an hour and a half. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3308.4s)]
*  These are the only public videos of the drones over Langley. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3314.56s)]
*  They're so familiar. They're so familiar. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3318.56s)]
*  From each other. Yes. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3319.44s)]
*  He shared this video with the FBI for its investigation. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3320.64s)]
*  And another. Yes. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3324.56s)]
*  The reports were coming in 20 to 30 sightings, same time every evening, 30 to 45 minutes after [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3326.08s)]
*  sunset. Retired four-star general Mark Kelly was the highest ranking officer at Langley to [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3332.32s)]
*  witness the swarm. A veteran fighter pilot, Kelly went up to the roof of a squadron headquarters for [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3338.56s)]
*  an unobstructed view of the airborne invaders. So what did you see? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3344.72s)]
*  Well, what you saw was different sizes of incursions of aircraft. You saw different [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3349.6800000000003s)]
*  altitudes, different airspeed. Some were rather loud. Some weren't near as loud. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3355.28s)]
*  What was the smallest one? What was the largest one? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3360.32s)]
*  The smallest, you know, you're talking about a commercial size quadcopter. And then the [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3363.36s)]
*  largest ones are probably size what I would call a bass boat or a small car. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3369.04s)]
*  The size of a small car. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3373.84s)]
*  Hmm. At the time, General Glenn Van Hurk was joint commander of NORAD and NORTHCOM, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3374.96s)]
*  the military commands that protect North American airspace. He has since retired. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3381.6800000000003s)]
*  I actually provided support in the form of fighters, airborne warning and control platforms, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3386.96s)]
*  helicopters to try to further categorize what those drones were at the time. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3393.76s)]
*  Ten months earlier, he ordered an F-22 from Langley to shoot down that Chinese spy balloon [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3399.92s)]
*  over the Atlantic after it had sailed across the U.S. But this time, he found himself ill-equipped [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3405.68s)]
*  to respond. NORAD's radar systems, designed during the Cold War to detect high-altitude air, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3412.56s)]
*  space or missile attacks, were unable to detect low-flying drones that could be seen with the [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3419.7599999999998s)]
*  naked eye. Why don't we just shoot them down? Well, first you have to have the capability to [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3426.16s)]
*  detect, track, identify, make sure it's not a civilian airplane flying around. If you can do [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3431.6s)]
*  that, Bill, then it becomes a safety issue for the American public. Firing missiles in our homeland [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3439.2799999999997s)]
*  is not taken lightly. We're not able to track them? We're not able to see where they originate? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3446.3999999999996s)]
*  No, it's the capability gap. Certainly, they can come and go from any direction. The FBI is looking [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3454.72s)]
*  at potential options, but they don't have an answer right now. And there haven't been answers [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3460.56s)]
*  for similar encroachments for more than five years. There are multiple UASs in the vicinity of [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3465.92s)]
*  Alhamlinson, CPA 100 feet in altitude off the bow. In 2019, naval warships training off the [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3470.96s)]
*  California coast were shadowed for weeks by dozens of drones. We have visual for probable [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3477.92s)]
*  with course unknown and unknown. For years, the Pentagon did little to dispel speculation. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3487.12s)]
*  These images taken with night vision equipment were UFOs, but ships logs show they were identified [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3493.84s)]
*  as drones at the time. And the Navy suspected they came from this Hong Kong flag freighter [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3501.2000000000003s)]
*  sailing nearby, but couldn't prove it. Since then, the defense news site, the war zone has [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3507.28s)]
*  documented dozens of drone intrusions at sensitive infrastructure and military installations. In 2019, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3514.4s)]
*  the Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona, the largest power producer in the country. In 2024, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3522.1600000000003s)]
*  an experimental weapons site in Southern California, where defense contractors are building [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3529.28s)]
*  the next generation of stealth bombers. Last December, the army confirmed 11 drone sightings [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3534.48s)]
*  over the Picatinny arsenal in Northern New Jersey, where advanced weapons are designed and built. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3541.04s)]
*  What is that? Which ignited a public frenzy with sightings of unidentified flying objects [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3546.96s)]
*  all over the region. New Jersey remains the epicenter of the drone mystery. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3553.6s)]
*  While much of the country was fixated on New Jersey, another swarm of drones was disrupting [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3559.2s)]
*  operations at an air base in the UK, where US nuclear weapons have been stored. Clearly, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3564.72s)]
*  there is a military intelligence aspect of this. Republican Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3572.16s)]
*  is chairman of the Armed Services Committee that oversees the Pentagon. We talked to him this past [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3578.96s)]
*  December. Do you believe that these drones are a spying system, a spying platform? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3585.28s)]
*  What would a logical person conclude? [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3592.7200000000003s)]
*  That. That these are spying incursions. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3596.5600000000004s)]
*  And yet, I can tell you, I am privy to classified briefings at the highest level. I think the [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3600.88s)]
*  Pentagon and the national security advisors are still mystified. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3611.44s)]
*  Still mystified? Yes. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3616.56s)]
*  More alarming? With drones overhead, some of the F-22s stationed at Langley were moved to a nearby [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3618.8s)]
*  air base for their own protection. There's a new wartime reality. Drones that can spy can also [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3626.2400000000002s)]
*  destroy. Deep inside Russia, advanced aircraft have been destroyed by Ukrainian drones. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3633.36s)]
*  General Van Hurk told us drones could do the same thing here. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3640.72s)]
*  I have seen video of drones in various sizes flying over the F-22 flight line at Langley. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3644.9599999999996s)]
*  What's your reaction to that? They could drop ordnance on them, drop bombs on them. They could [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3652.7999999999997s)]
*  crash into them to disable them. Was that a concern? Absolutely, it's a concern. Small UAS [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3658.72s)]
*  or drones can do a myriad of missions. President Biden was informed of the Langley intrusions, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3665.76s)]
*  and meetings were held at the White House to figure out how to bring the drones down. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3672.5600000000004s)]
*  But after 17 nights, the drone visitation stopped. A senior official in the Biden White House later [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3677.6800000000003s)]
*  downplayed the incident to 60 minutes, saying it was likely the work of hobbyists. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3684.7200000000003s)]
*  From what you saw, did you rule out that these might be hobbyists sending these drones up? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3690.8s)]
*  No, it would be my assessment they weren't hobbyists because of the magnitude of the events, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3699.52s)]
*  the sizes of some of the drones, and the duration. So what's going on? Well, I wish I had the answer. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3705.36s)]
*  It certainly could have a foreign nexus, a threat nexus. They could be doing anything from surveilling [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3712.0s)]
*  critical infrastructure, just to the point of embarrassing us from the fact that they can do [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3718.56s)]
*  this on a day-to-day basis, and then we're not able to do anything about it. In overseas war zones, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3724.88s)]
*  the U.S. military has broad authority to bring down menacing drones with gunfire, missiles, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3731.7599999999998s)]
*  and electronic jamming. Here at home, any of those actions would pose a threat to civilians on the [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3738.16s)]
*  ground and in the air. Well, we certainly need new systems to counter this threat. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3744.72s)]
*  A year ago, General Gregory Geo, a combat veteran, took control of NORAD and NORTHCOM. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3752.16s)]
*  He ordered a 90-day assessment of operations and says the drones or UAVs at Langley became [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3758.7999999999997s)]
*  the centerpiece. We're the most powerful military on the face of the earth, and yet drones could [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3765.7599999999998s)]
*  fly over a major Air Force base, and we couldn't stop them? How is that possible? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3774.72s)]
*  Well, I think the threat got ahead of our ability to detect and track the threat. I think all eyes [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3783.4399999999996s)]
*  were rightfully overseas, where UAVs were being used on one-way attack to attack U.S. and coalition [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3792.48s)]
*  service members, and the threat into the U.S. probably caught us by surprise a little bit. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3799.7599999999998s)]
*  As it stands today, could you detect a swarm of drones flying over or flying into the airspace [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3806.24s)]
*  at Langley? Could you detect that today? At low altitude, probably not with your standard [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3817.2s)]
*  FAA or surveillance radars. Complicating his efforts? Bureaucracy. When the drones flew [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3826.3999999999996s)]
*  outside the perimeter of Langley Air Force base, other agencies had jurisdiction. The Coast Guard, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3835.8399999999997s)]
*  FAA, FBI, and local police. There was no one agency in charge. So what did you determine [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3842.48s)]
*  went on at Langley? Well, that investigation is still ongoing, so I don't think [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3850.64s)]
*  we know entirely what happened. You know, when we hear things from the White House that it's not [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3858.32s)]
*  deemed a threat, it seems to me that this is alarming. I mean, this is kind of hair on fire [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3863.04s)]
*  time. It is alarming, and I would say that our hair is on fire here in North Comm in a controlled [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3871.44s)]
*  way, and we're moving out extremely quickly. This past November, General Guillault was given [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3878.88s)]
*  the authority to cut through the red tape and coordinate counter drone efforts across multiple [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3884.6400000000003s)]
*  government agencies. He says new, more sensitive radar systems are being installed at strategic [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3890.6400000000003s)]
*  bases, and North Comm is developing what it calls flyaway kits with the latest anti-drone technology [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3897.36s)]
*  to be delivered to bases besieged by drones. My goal is inside of a year that we would have [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3904.8s)]
*  the flyaway capability to augment the services and the installations if they're necessary. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3911.04s)]
*  So within a year, were Langley to happen again, there'd be some ability to respond. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3917.2000000000003s)]
*  That's my goal. His predecessor, Glenn Van Hurk, says the Pentagon, White House, and Congress [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3925.76s)]
*  have underestimated this massive vulnerability for far too long. It's been one year since Langley [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3932.08s)]
*  had their drone incursion, and we don't have the policies and laws in place to deal with this. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3940.4s)]
*  That's not a sense of urgency. Why do you think that is? I think it's because there's a perception [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3946.24s)]
*  that this is Fortress America, two oceans on the east and west with friendly nations north and south, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3954.08s)]
*  and nobody's going to attack our homeland. It's time we move beyond that assumption. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1LhUT87xQ&t=3960.64s)]
