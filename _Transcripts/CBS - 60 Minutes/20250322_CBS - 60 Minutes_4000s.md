# Stories About Cryptocurrency | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [March 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA)
*  The Cryptocurrency Business [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=0.0s)]
*  Rarely in American politics has a new industry spent so much money with such apparent impact [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=11.84s)]
*  as the cryptocurrency business did in the last election. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are digital assets created and maintained by networks of computers, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=21.68s)]
*  mystifying to some and mesmerizing to others, they're used for transactions [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=28.24s)]
*  and as high-risk investments with potentially high rewards. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  At least 17 million Americans own crypto, and how the industry should be regulated in the US [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=37.44s)]
*  has been the subject of much dispute. With an important piece of legislation now before [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=43.44s)]
*  Congress, perhaps it's no surprise that big crypto companies were among the top donors [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  in this past election. And since the election, the price of Bitcoin has hit record highs. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=54.88s)]
*  It isn't clear whether the crypto industry will get Congress or the incoming Trump administration [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=61.6s)]
*  to craft the regulation or the legitimacy that they seek, but they've been investing [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=67.28s)]
*  a whole lot of their own cash to get something. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=72.80000000000001s)]
*  In the final months of a hotly contested race for a Senate seat in Ohio, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=79.76s)]
*  Republican Bernie Marino received $40 million of positive ads from a political action committee [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=84.16s)]
*  known as the SuperPAT. Defend American jobs is responsible for the content of this ad. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=90.08s)]
*  The ads didn't mention cryptocurrency at all, but they were paid for by crypto companies, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=95.12s)]
*  and they helped Marino defeat Democrat Sherrod Brown. This is a disappointment. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=100.56s)]
*  The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and an outspoken critic of crypto. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=105.12s)]
*  In a close election, that kind of money makes a huge difference, particularly in the end of a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=110.0s)]
*  cycle. Do you think you tip the scales? Do I think that putting that amount of money [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  in the Ohio election had an impact? Absolutely. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=121.2s)]
*  Brad Garlinghouse is the CEO of a company called Ripple, whose cryptocurrency XRP became the third [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=124.96s)]
*  largest in the world this past week. Ripple and two other companies contributed $144 million to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=130.96s)]
*  SuperPACs that supported pro-crypto Republicans and Democrats. Do I think we had an impact to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=138.4s)]
*  elect a Democratic Senator in Michigan, Alyssa Slotkin? Yes, absolutely. Do I think we had an [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=144.8s)]
*  impact in Arizona? A Democratic Senator in Arizona, Gallego? Absolutely. Overall, crypto companies [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=150.72s)]
*  contributed one-third of all direct corporate contributions to SuperPACs. Of the 29 Republicans [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=158.16s)]
*  and 33 Democrats the industry backed in congressional races, 85% won. It's incredible. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=164.4s)]
*  So you see this election as a major victory? For sure. But some people will look at that and say, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=171.6s)]
*  you teamed up and bought an election. I think the thing, voters voted. We educated voters, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=177.28s)]
*  as many industries do, about candidates. But you helped supercharge the candidates with the money [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=183.28s)]
*  in the coffers, right? We absolutely did. On whatever they is that they wanted to talk about. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=189.36s)]
*  That's absolutely right. So in your mind, is the message for any lawmaker looking to run for office [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=192.8s)]
*  that they have to take your industry seriously, fear your industry? I think all citizens should [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=200.08s)]
*  want people in Congress, on the Senate and the House, who are going to look to how do we use [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=207.36s)]
*  technologies in a way to benefit citizens. But the best news for the crypto industry came at the top [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=211.68s)]
*  of the ticket. The United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=218.88s)]
*  superpower of the world and we'll get it done. Before this cycle, in June of 2021, Donald Trump [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=225.04s)]
*  was saying Bitcoin seems like a scam. Do you understand what happened with that transformation? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=231.92s)]
*  I didn't have a front row seat to that. I think it's clear that Donald Trump embraced crypto and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=237.12s)]
*  crypto embraced Donald Trump. Big news, the World W financial token sale is now live. Three weeks [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=241.68s)]
*  before the election, Trump announced the launch of a new digital coin that he had a financial stake [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=248.16s)]
*  in. Is that a conflict of interest in your point of view? Whether or not it's a conflict of interest, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=253.2s)]
*  the voters have knowingly said we want this person to be our president. The voters have spoken more [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  so than I have. Trump's cabinet picks have had very positive things to say about crypto. Here's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=264.64s)]
*  what his choice for Treasury Secretary Scott Besson told Fox Business News. Crypto is about [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay. Perhaps most significantly, this past week, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=275.84s)]
*  Trump selected a new head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Paul Atkins, a former SEC [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  commissioner who's done some consulting for crypto companies, is expected to take a very [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=290.08s)]
*  different approach than Biden-era chair Gary Gensler, who filed more than 120 lawsuits against [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=294.96s)]
*  crypto companies. Last year, Gensler told the House Financial Services Committee, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=300.88s)]
*  I've never seen a field that's so non-compliant with laws written by Congress. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=306.24s)]
*  Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says the SEC's approach was the main reason his company and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  two others created the biggest industry super PAC called Fair Shake. People are like, why did [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=317.6s)]
*  these companies come together and organize and say this matters? And it's a reaction to a war [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=323.36s)]
*  on crypto. So if there had been a different SEC chair than Gary Gensler? I'm not sure Fair [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=331.04s)]
*  Shake would exist. Really? Absolutely. In response, an SEC spokesperson said, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=336.16s)]
*  any amount spent by the crypto industry on legal defense or influence peddling pales in comparison [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=343.36s)]
*  to the savings lost by crypto investors to frauds and failures. It was definitely a war on crypto. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=349.6s)]
*  John Reed Stark, former chief of internet enforcement at the SEC, says he owns no [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=356.88s)]
*  cryptocurrency and has never worked for the industry. Like Garlinghouse, he believes voters [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  have given president-elect Trump a mandate to govern. As far as these election results are [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=366.72s)]
*  concerned, the clear mandate is the SEC needs to lay off crypto, and that's exactly what's going to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  happen. But that doesn't mean this former SEC official thinks the agency's actions were wrong. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=376.96s)]
*  Crypto is a scourge. It's not something that you want in your society. It has no utility. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=382.88s)]
*  It's just pure speculation. Remember, there's no balance sheet to crypto. There's no financial [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=389.12s)]
*  statements. You're talking about SEC filings. There's no public disclosure mandate. Exactly. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=393.44s)]
*  Nothing. But also there's no audit, inspection, examination, net capital requirements, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=397.84s)]
*  no licensure of the individuals involved, and there's no transparency into it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=403.12s)]
*  That creates real systemic risks, not just risk for investors. But the other part that people [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=407.28s)]
*  don't really talk about enough are the dire externalities that are enabled by crypto. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=418.48s)]
*  Every single crime you can conceive up is easier to do now because of crypto, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=420.32s)]
*  especially ransomware, human sex trafficking, sanctions evasion, money laundering. North Korea [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=425.76s)]
*  is financing their nuclear weapons program using crypto. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=433.04s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried's conviction for fraud at one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=437.44s)]
*  is a case study of what can happen without proper oversight. Based in the Bahamas, the FTX exchange [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=442.8s)]
*  collapsed in 2022, imperiling $8 billion of customer assets, much of it beyond the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=449.76s)]
*  reach of U.S. regulators. There were crimes there. There was fraud there. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  I view that as not this is similar than if we say Bernie Madoff went to jail. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=460.8s)]
*  That doesn't make every hedge fund manager a criminal. There's a lot of good actors in crypto. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=465.2s)]
*  Ripple's CEO says his company employs 900 people and has been working with regulated [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=470.48s)]
*  financial institutions to create a faster and cheaper way for people to send money overseas. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=475.84s)]
*  XRP is the digital currency it uses to do that. But Ripple also sold the digital currency XRP [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  to investors, and XRP now trades on exchanges where people can buy or sell it in the hope [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=488.56s)]
*  of making a profit. So the SEC sued your company in December of 2020. That was the tail end of the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=494.32s)]
*  Trump administration. Why? Well, their allegation was that Ripple in our sales of XRP [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=500.8s)]
*  represented the sale of an unregistered security. A security like a stock or another asset class? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=507.6s)]
*  Correct. Garlinghouse says Ripple has spent over $150 million fighting the SEC in court, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=513.04s)]
*  arguing that the digital currency XRP shouldn't be subject to the agency's registration and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=520.48s)]
*  disclosure requirements, as if it were a stock offering. I went to Harvard Business School. I [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=526.0s)]
*  think I'm reasonably intelligent about something like what is a security. So never once had I [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=531.28s)]
*  considered the possibility that, okay, maybe XRP is a security. I've read every case. I've read [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=536.32s)]
*  every motion. And judges had said over and over again that these are securities. And they haven't [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=542.0s)]
*  said it like this is a close call. They said this is an obvious call. Brad Garlinghouse disputes [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=546.48s)]
*  that. He also argues that existing securities laws don't fit well with the new technology, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=552.56s)]
*  and Congress needs to draft new rules for these new digital assets. We haven't been asking to be [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=558.4799999999999s)]
*  deregulated. We've been asking to be regulated. So we have been saying, hey, look, just give us [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=564.56s)]
*  clear rules of the road. So what was your strategy with putting money to work in the election? Was it [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=569.52s)]
*  to then go write those rules of the road that you want written? No, our goal has been to simply get [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=575.92s)]
*  rules written. I mean, the good news is there was a... Not just any rules. Well, there was a bill [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=581.92s)]
*  passed this summer in the House, bipartisan support, called FIT 21. It was a Republican bill. 71 Democrats [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=588.16s)]
*  supported it. The bill is passed. FIT 21 tries to create a new regulatory framework for digital [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=594.88s)]
*  assets. While the SEC will still play a role, the legislation gives more responsibility for regulating [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=602.4799999999999s)]
*  cryptocurrencies to the CFTC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees futures [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=609.52s)]
*  markets for everything from gold to pork bellies and already has some jurisdiction over Bitcoin. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=616.16s)]
*  The SEC is about maybe 10 times the size of the CFTC. The SEC's mandate is one of investor [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=622.16s)]
*  protection. They have legions of attorneys who go out and do these inspections, examinations, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  and audits. The CFTC is more about the integrity of the marketplace. I don't blame the crypto [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=633.04s)]
*  industry for wanting to be under the CFTC. It's a much easier regulatory regime. It has bipartisan [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=639.04s)]
*  support and it passed the House. It doesn't surprise me at all that it has the support it has [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=645.68s)]

*  about, doesn't pay for them to be anti-crypto. There's no one that's going to give them [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=654.88s)]
*  contributions because of that. Lawmakers from both parties told us crypto firms will not escape [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=659.04s)]
*  scrutiny since there are consumer protections in the bill. And while it's not clear whether [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=665.2s)]
*  Republican leaders will reintroduce FIT21 in the new Congress, there is bipartisan agreement that [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=670.24s)]
*  something must be done to plug regulatory gaps and prevent confusion in a market that already exists. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=676.72s)]
*  Where is the United States better served? Are we served by creating clear rules of the road and [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=683.84s)]
*  having this industry thrive here at home, or should we push it offshore where people are less [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=688.48s)]
*  protected? But even some of the big financial names on Wall Street have been skeptical of [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=692.64s)]
*  crypto. Jamie Dimon called it Pet Rock. There are big skeptics, I think, anytime a new technology, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=697.92s)]
*  new industry emerges. The counter to what you're describing is the most successful ETF ever in the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=703.04s)]
*  United States- Exchange traded fund. ... was the Bitcoin ETF. The Bitcoin ETF went live, I think, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=709.6s)]
*  in January of this year and attracted more assets in a faster amount of time than any ETF ever before. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=714.8s)]
*  Exchange traded funds, or ETFs, are like mutual funds. Offered by well-known investment firms and [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=721.92s)]
*  big banks, they make it easy for people to invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies without [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=727.92s)]
*  directly buying it themselves. Even Jamie Dimon's bank offers clients investments in these assets [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=733.68s)]
*  he once described as Pet Rocks. Am I surprised that these big banks have gotten into the crypto [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=740.08s)]
*  space? No, because there's huge amounts of money to be made in fees. Do you think that everyday [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=746.0s)]
*  people who want to make money in the crypto space understand the risk that they assume? I think many [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=752.72s)]
*  people understand it's a volatile market and I think many people choose to participate. Many [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=758.72s)]
*  people choose to participate in the gambling market, also very risky. Should we, as a government, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=763.6s)]
*  tell people how they should and shouldn't use their hard-earned money? With the value of Ripple's XRP [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=768.48s)]
*  currency up more than 300 percent since the election, Brad Garlinghouse recently announced [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=774.8s)]
*  the company was putting another 25 million into the industry super PAC, Fairshake. With that donation, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=780.4s)]
*  Fairshake already has 103 million dollars to spend on pro crypto candidates in the midterm elections [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  two years from now. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=794.16s)]
*  Michael Lewis has made a literary career finding jump-off-the-page characters and using them to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=796.64s)]
*  help tell complicated stories. And what could be more complicated than explaining cryptocurrency? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=809.12s)]
*  Lewis gained all hours access to Sam Bankman Fried, known for a time as the J.P. Morgan of crypto. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=815.68s)]
*  His sector, as ungoverned as his hair, Bankman Fried was worth more than 20 billion dollars [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=822.24s)]
*  before he turned 30. An unlikely celebrity, his life braided finance, politics, sports, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=827.52s)]
*  and pop culture. Then the empire crumbled and today Bankman Fried sits in jail on various [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=833.44s)]
*  federal charges and faces potential sentences of more than 100 years. Lewis, though, didn't [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=839.52s)]
*  panic sell. He simply went where the story took him. His latest book, Going Infinite, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=845.44s)]
*  comes out Tuesday, which is also the opening day in the trial of Sam Bankman Fried. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=850.4s)]
*  You had so much access to Sam Bankman Fried writing this book. What ultimately is the purpose here? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=856.72s)]
*  I realized I had an ambition for the book. I saw it as a kind of letter to the jury. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=863.76s)]
*  I mean, there's going to be this trial and the lawyers are going to tell two stories. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=867.76s)]
*  And so there's a story war going on in the courtroom and I think neither one of those [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=872.48s)]
*  stories is as good as the story I have. Michael Lewis didn't set out to write this book. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=876.72s)]
*  Two autumns ago, he was at home in the Bay Area when he got a call from a friend [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=882.24s)]
*  interested in investing with a young billionaire. Could Lewis meet with this wonder kind and size [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=886.4s)]
*  him up? So it was Lewis brought Sam Bankman Fried here in the Berkeley Hills for a hike in the park. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=892.32s)]
*  You gotta remember, I knew nothing about him. All I knew was I was supposed to evaluate his character [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=899.12s)]
*  and that 18 months earlier he had nothing. Now he had $22.5 billion and was the richest person [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=904.0s)]
*  in the world under 30. He cared much about like spending it on yachts. He was going to spend it [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=910.08s)]
*  to save humanity from extinction kind of thing. So the whole walk was like my jaw was on the floor [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=914.48s)]
*  by here after I heard all that. As an author whose stock and trade is finding interesting characters, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=920.96s)]
*  is your story meter starting to beep about now? I was on a red alert and I said this to him. I said, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=926.32s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen to you. Something's going to happen to you. Can I just [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=932.5600000000001s)]
*  come and you know ride shotgun? Now riding shotgun ended up being like hanging on for dear life [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=936.4s)]
*  to you know an automobile that's going 270 miles an hour and taking every hairpin turn. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=942.64s)]
*  My instinct was we should very slowly be trickling out these positions. Sam Bankman Fried and Lewis [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=947.0400000000001s)]
*  would end up meeting more than a hundred times over two years, speaking for countless hours. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=953.76s)]
*  As our camera rolled in July, note how Bankman Fried shuffled cards and jackhammered his legs [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=959.84s)]
*  and avoided eye contact. Lewis considers Bankman Fried the most challenging and fascinating [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=965.76s)]
*  character he's ever encountered. This from an author who's been writing non-fiction since the 80s. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=972.08s)]
*  I want to talk about that guy. The story of Sam's life is people not understanding him, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=978.0s)]
*  misreading him. He's so different, he's so unusual. I mean I think in a funny way that [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=983.36s)]
*  the reason I have such a compelling story is I have a character that I do come to know and [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=988.4s)]
*  that the reader comes to know that the world still doesn't know. A graduate of MIT, Bankman [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=994.08s)]
*  Fried saw the world in numbers, framing everything in his life as a probability exercise, including [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1001.2800000000001s)]
*  philanthropy. He committed to making as much money as possible so he could give it away as [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1007.2800000000001s)]
*  efficiently as possible, guided by a social movement, effective altruism. What it means in [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1013.6s)]
*  Sam's instance is you can go out and have a career where you do good, you can go be a doctor in [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1019.84s)]
*  Africa, or you can go out and make as much money as possible and pay people to be doctors in Africa. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1024.96s)]
*  If you're a doctor in Africa you get you end up saving a certain number of lives but you're only [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1030.8s)]
*  one doctor. But if you can pay 40 people to become doctors in Africa you're going to save [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1034.72s)]
*  40 times the number of lives. This is like a strategy game. Well you don't understand Sam [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1041.52s)]
*  Bankman Fried unless you understand that he turns everything into a game. Everything is gamified. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1045.52s)]
*  Bankman Fried worked as a Wall Street trader before moving to Berkeley at age 25 to start his own [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1050.48s)]
*  trading firm, Alameda Research. Instead of buying and selling stocks or bonds he would [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1056.0s)]
*  traffic in crypto, a digital form of currency not tied to a centralized system. The basic idea was [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1061.8400000000001s)]
*  to be the smartest person in the crypto markets, to be the one who did the kind of trading in crypto [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1069.12s)]
*  that the smartest Wall Street traders did in stocks. So these quant skills he had as a trader on [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1073.6799999999998s)]
*  regular stocks and equities markets he was going to bring to this new ascending crypto world. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1078.4799999999998s)]
*  Correct. What's the difference between crypto finance and traditional finance? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1083.9199999999998s)]
*  Well the promise of crypto finance is the promise of an absence of intermediaries. If I want to wire [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1087.1999999999998s)]
*  you $10,000 a bank has to do it. A bank records a transaction, a bank takes some little slice of it. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1092.7199999999998s)]
*  If I want to wire you $10,000 worth of bitcoin I can just hit a button and you get it. So you remove [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1098.8s)]
*  the institutions. Coming out of the 2008 financial crisis crypto took hold as an anti-establishment [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1103.76s)]
*  punk rock version of a financial system which Lewis finds ironic. In the beginning especially [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1111.36s)]
*  it's a crowd of people who are incredibly mistrustful of institutions. What attracts them to it is they [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1118.08s)]
*  hate the government, they hate banks, but then they somehow this pool of incredibly mistrustful [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1123.52s)]
*  people proceed to trust each other in ways that I wouldn't trust you. They're parking their money [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1129.52s)]
*  in a sector that's unregulated, there are no physical properties. Provenly squirrely and [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1135.28s)]
*  unreliable over and over. But it's predicated on trust. They are Charlie Brown kicking the [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1140.24s)]
*  football. They're sure that this time Lucy's going to hold it. Still Bankman Fried made a fortune at [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1145.28s)]
*  Alameda Research and then he really got rich. Instead of simply trading Bankman Fried seized [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1151.92s)]
*  on the idea of opening his own cryptocurrency exchange. One of the things he notices is that [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1158.48s)]
*  all the crypto exchanges are screwed up in one way or another. There are dozens of these places [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1164.8000000000002s)]
*  where you can trade crypto but they are they're not structured for a professional trader. The [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1169.04s)]
*  technology is bad, they'll lose their customers money. It's the Wild West. He realizes that if [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1174.16s)]
*  you built a better exchange, he wanted to build an exchange he could trade on. So he creates FTX [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1180.4s)]
*  and once he created it, it went boom. And when it went boom, he realized that, well, that's the [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1186.64s)]
*  gold mine. It actually isn't trading the crypto. This is owning the casino. He started as a gambler [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1194.16s)]
*  and he realized that building the better casino was actually going to be more valuable. FTX has [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1200.16s)]
*  seen explosive growth. Soon roughly $15 billion a day in trades were executed on his new exchange, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1205.04s)]
*  FTX. If you're sitting in the middle of those transactions and you're taking out even a tiny [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1212.32s)]
*  fraction of a percentage point, there's a lot of money to be made. Indifferent to the outcome of [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1216.72s)]
*  the trade. You're taking no risk. You're taking no risk at all. It didn't matter to him whether [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1221.04s)]
*  crypto went up or crypto went down. As long as people are trading crypto, it made money. It's [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1224.96s)]
*  the best business. I had one venture capitalist tell me that several venture capitalists thought [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1229.12s)]
*  that Sam might be the world's first trillionaire. They're looking for the next Google. They're [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1234.8s)]
*  looking for the next Apple. They thought FTX had that kind of possibility, that it had a chance to [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1239.84s)]
*  be the single most important financial institution in the world. As he began accumulating billions [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1244.6399999999999s)]
*  as if they were Pokemon cards, Bankman Freed began attracting something else he wasn't accustomed to. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1250.8799999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of leveraging cryptocurrency markets. Attention. He changed not at all. You know, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1256.72s)]
*  he'd never been on TV. He goes on TV in his cargo shorts and his messy hair and he's playing video [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1261.52s)]
*  games while he's on the air. Oh wait, he's playing video games on the air. You would think your first [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1265.92s)]
*  television appearance, you might be a little, a little, a little uptight, a little nervous. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1270.16s)]
*  And if you watch the clip, you can see his eyes going back and forth and forth. This is because [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1273.6000000000001s)]
*  he's trying to win his video game at the same time he's on the air. Whether it was his smarts, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1277.2s)]
*  his fierce indifference to appearance or simply his vast wealth, the beautiful people suddenly [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1281.44s)]
*  found him irresistible. As his net worth goes up, so does his social capital. You write about a [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1286.88s)]
*  zoom meeting you walked in on. He says, I got to go do a zoom. I said, what is it? And he says, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1293.44s)]
*  there's this person named Anna Wintour and he didn't know who she was. He had no idea who she was. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1298.48s)]
*  No. So I sat off to one side where she couldn't see me and I watched this zoom. Now your thing, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1303.28s)]
*  what does Anna Wintour want to do with a schlub like Sam? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1308.8000000000002s)]
*  Exactly. He is the worst dressed person in America. He is the worst dressed billionaire [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1311.2s)]
*  in the history of billionaires. What she wants him to do is to sponsor the Met Gala, her great ball [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1316.88s)]
*  that she throws every year, which is all about dress and appearances. Sam was a social experiment. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1323.76s)]
*  He is a person who has nothing, all of a sudden has seemingly infinite dollars. Will give it away, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1329.52s)]
*  is unbelievably open-handed about it and doesn't ask a whole lot of questions. What that attracts, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1336.16s)]
*  who shows up when that, when this person exists, everybody, everyone comes to the trough. Everybody [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1341.28s)]
*  comes to the trough. Everybody is, wants to be his best friend. FTX is the safest and easiest way to [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1346.0800000000002s)]
*  buy and sell crypto. Bankman Fried wanted it known that FTX was the go-to player in crypto. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1350.72s)]
*  Hey, it's Shaquille O'Neal and I'm excited to be partnering with FTX. He turned to the sports world [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1356.4s)]
*  to bring his exchange both legitimacy and edge. Lewis saw the FTX internal marketing documents. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1361.2s)]
*  He paid Tom Brady $55 million for 20 hours a year for three years. He paid Steph Curry $35 million [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1368.24s)]
*  for same thing for three years. Pretty good hourly wage. He spent a hundred and something million [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1374.88s)]
*  dollars buying the naming rights for the Miami Heat Arena. I don't think so. He spent $25 million [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1379.52s)]
*  making a Super Bowl ad with Larry David. It's FTX? I don't think so. For which he then paid Larry [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1385.28s)]
*  David another $10 million. It's breathtaking what's on that list. Did any of the people [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1390.88s)]
*  surrounding him, these celebrities, do it because they found him interesting or was it all because [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1395.1200000000001s)]
*  he's worth $27 billion? It's probably not fair for me to speak for them, but I will speak for them. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1399.68s)]
*  Tom Brady, I think adored him. I think Tom Brady thought he was just a really interesting person. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1406.8000000000002s)]
*  I think he'd like to hear what he had to say. What's up, guys? I'm here with my boy Sam from FTX. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1412.0800000000002s)]
*  And he really liked Tom Brady. And Sam wasn't like a big sports person. So it was funny to watch [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1416.8s)]
*  that interaction. It was like these two people actually get along. It's like the class nerd [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1421.84s)]
*  and the quarterback. The two high school tribes. The nerd of all nerds. Like even the nerds don't [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1426.48s)]
*  hang out with this nerd. He's such a nerd. The quarterback somehow likes him and he somehow [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1431.44s)]
*  likes the quarterback. Lewis writes in his book that Bankman Freed's philanthropic ambitions kept [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1436.32s)]
*  pace with his wealth. Never mind doctors in Africa, he set out to confront what he saw as [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1442.56s)]
*  existential threats to all of humanity. Sam Bankman Freed ends up with a portfolio [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1448.1599999999999s)]
*  heavily concentrated in two things. Pandemic prevention because there really are things the [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1453.9199999999998s)]
*  government should be doing. And the other thing that made his list that was so interesting [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1458.56s)]
*  was Donald Trump. He took the view that all the big existential problems are going to require the [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1462.8s)]
*  United States government to be involved to solve them. And if the democracy is undermined, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1468.8s)]
*  we don't have our democracy anymore. All these problems are less likely to be solved. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1474.8799999999999s)]
*  And he saw Trump trying to undermine the democracy and he thought Trump belongs on the list of [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1479.36s)]
*  existential risks. To that end, Lewis writes that in 2022 Bankman Freed met with the most unlikely [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1484.8799999999999s)]
*  of allies. Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. You're flying with Sam and he tells you [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1491.36s)]
*  about a meeting he's going to have with Mitch McConnell. Well, the interesting thing starts [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1497.2s)]
*  before we even get on the plane. I meet him at the airport and he comes tumbling out of a car [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1500.24s)]
*  and he's in his cargo shorts and his t-shirt and he's got balled up in his hand. It takes me a while [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1504.4s)]
*  to see what it is, but it's a blue suit. It's got more wrinkles than any blue suit ever had. It's [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1510.0800000000002s)]
*  been just jammed in his little ball and a shoe falls out of the pile that he's got in his arms. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1513.68s)]
*  And I say, why do you have the suit? He says, Mitch McConnell really cares what you wear, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1519.92s)]
*  what you meet with him. And he's having dinner in six hours with Mitch McConnell. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1525.44s)]
*  And I said, well, you got the suit. Is there, you got a belt? He goes, no, I don't have a belt. I [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1530.4s)]
*  said, you got, you have a shirt? He goes, no, no shirt. And the suit, you really can't really [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1534.64s)]
*  wear that suit. And he goes, yeah, but they told me to bring a suit. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1539.3600000000001s)]
*  According to Lewis, Bankman Freed wanted to help McConnell fund Republican candidates at odds with [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1543.2s)]
*  Donald Trump. What is the subtext of this dinner is Sam is going to write tens of millions of [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1549.36s)]
*  dollars a check to Super PAC that Mitch McConnell is then going to use to get elected people who [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1554.8799999999999s)]
*  are not hostile to democracy. Wait, so Mitch McConnell has a list of Republican candidates [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1561.1999999999998s)]
*  who are sort of on the playing field for democracy versus what he deemed outside. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1566.6399999999999s)]
*  He and his people had done the work to distinguish between actual deep Trumpers and people who were [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1570.8799999999999s)]
*  just seeming to approve of Donald Trump, but were actually willing to govern. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1575.92s)]
*  Bankman Freed ended up giving multi-millions in support of Republican candidates. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1580.8000000000002s)]
*  Back in 2020, Bankman Freed had ranked among Joe Biden's biggest donors. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1586.24s)]
*  As 2024 approached, he planned on spending more, albeit in the most unconventional way. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1590.96s)]
*  One of the most shocking passages in this book, I thought, came with this revelation that Sam had [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1597.76s)]
*  looked into paying Donald Trump not to run. That only shocks you if you don't know Sam. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1602.0s)]
*  Sam's thinking we could pay Donald Trump not to run for president. Like how much would it take? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1608.32s)]
*  Did he get an answer? So he did get an answer. He was floated. There was a number that was kicking [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1614.48s)]
*  around and the number was kicking around when I was talking to Sam about this was $5 billion. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1618.32s)]
*  Sam was not sure that number came directly from Trump. Wait, wait. So Sam's looking into paying [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1622.08s)]
*  Trump not to run. And he actually get, didn't mean to come from Trump himself, but he actually [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1627.2s)]
*  got a price? He got one answer. Yes. The question Sam had was not just is $5 billion enough to [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1632.0800000000002s)]
*  pay Trump not to run, but was it legal? Well, why didn't this happen? Why didn't you follow through? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1640.16s)]
*  Well, they were still having these conversations when FTX blew up. So why didn't happen? He didn't [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1645.8400000000001s)]
*  have $5 billion anymore. Approached for comment by 60 Minutes, neither former President Trump nor [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1650.4s)]
*  Senator McConnell responded. Last November, in a matter of days, mega billionaire Sam [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1656.8s)]
*  Bankman Fried lost virtually everything. And he soon faced an onslaught of federal fraud charges. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1662.72s)]
*  When we return the fall of Sam Bankman Fried. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1669.2s)]
*  Meteoric as the rise of Sam Bankman Fried was, the fall came faster still. In a span of days, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1680.1599999999999s)]
*  a celebrity multi-billionaire became a pariah, his wealth largely evaporated as federal prosecutors [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1686.16s)]
*  mounted a case against him. In his new book out this week, Michael Lewis details the crash [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1692.5600000000002s)]
*  and leaves it to readers to decide if Sam Bankman Fried was a cryptocurrency conman in cargo shorts [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1698.5600000000002s)]
*  or a really smart guy, singularly ill equipped to run and manage a business. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1705.28s)]
*  By spring of 2022, Sam Bankman Fried had planted his flag in the Bahamas. He decided to move his [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1709.76s)]
*  high-flying cryptocurrency exchange FTX to the islands, not for the beaches, but for the friendly [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1715.92s)]
*  regulatory climate. With the Prime Minister on hand, they put shovels in the ground for a new [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1722.0s)]
*  headquarters. Bankman Fried openly discussed paying off the country's $9 billion national debt. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1727.68s)]
*  By this point, Michael Lewis and Bankman Fried had a dynamic that went beyond author subject. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1734.16s)]
*  And he started using me as a sounding board. For what? For just like decisions he was making. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1739.28s)]
*  Should I join Elon Musk in buying Twitter? You know, should we do this? Should we do that? What'd you [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1743.76s)]
*  tell him? Mostly my answers were no, no, and no. And he would look at me and say, you're a boring [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1749.68s)]
*  grownup. In Bankman Fried, now 31, told Lewis, now 62, that anyone on Twitter would be a conman. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1754.64s)]
*  In 1992, that anyone older than 45 was useless. But Lewis noted that if ever there were a corporate [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1762.32s)]
*  leader in need of adult input to manage 400 employees, it was Sam Bankman Fried. What kind [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1769.6s)]
*  of a manager was he? Horrible. I mean, even his best friends inside the company said Sam is just [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1776.3999999999999s)]
*  not built to manage people. Had Sam managed anything before? His sole experience of leadership [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1782.08s)]
*  was running puzzle hunts for math nerds at a high school and actually thought deep down, if you asked [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1788.56s)]
*  him, people shouldn't need to be managed. So he proceeded to act on that and basically didn't [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1794.8799999999999s)]
*  manage them. Is there any checks and balances happening in this environment then? Well, what [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1800.24s)]
*  checks and balances would you imagine there might be in a corporation? Chief financial officer? No, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1804.8s)]
*  there's no chief financial officer. HR department? No, there was no HR department. Compliance office? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1809.84s)]
*  Oh no, no. There was no board of directors. Or rather, I asked Sam, I said, who's your board of [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1814.88s)]
*  directors? And he said, we don't really have one. I said, what do you mean you don't have one? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1820.24s)]
*  Everyone has one. He says, there are two other people on something called a board of directors, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1824.0800000000002s)]
*  but it's changed and I don't even know their names. And their job is just to docusign with it. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1828.0s)]
*  He didn't know the name of the board of directors. No, he didn't know who was on it. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1831.7600000000002s)]
*  So he's running this like a lemonade stand and he's doing enough volume of business. This could [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1834.4s)]
*  be a public traded company if you wanted to. Oh, if it was a publicly traded company, it would [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1839.2s)]
*  be a publicly traded company worth $40 billion. No, it was all Sam's world. And there was nobody [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1842.64s)]
*  there to say, like, don't do that. FTX purchased a $30 million executive penthouse in the Bahamas [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1848.48s)]
*  resort, flush with an exclusive Marina. It was lost on Sam, who worked feverishly in the office [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1856.72s)]
*  and slept on a beanbag chair. But there was another reason he avoided the Luxe penthouse. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1863.1200000000001s)]
*  His girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, a former Wall Street trader herself, had kicked him out. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1868.88s)]
*  Compounding matters, he had put her in charge of running Alameda Research, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1874.72s)]
*  Bankman Freed's privately held trading firm. So the romance between Sam and Caroline go sideways. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1879.2s)]
*  How does that impact what happens to FTX and Alameda Research? Coincidentally, the romance [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1885.2800000000002s)]
*  more than go sideways. They have a falling out where they're basically not speaking to each other. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1891.2800000000002s)]
*  She's not speaking to him at precisely the time crypto collapses. Explain why that's a problem. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1894.48s)]
*  It's a problem because Alameda Research is one of the traders on FTX. Translation, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1900.88s)]
*  though Bankman Freed owned the FTX exchange, he was also trading crypto on FTX through his other [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1908.56s)]
*  business, Alameda Research. And he was gambling in his own casino. And it created conflicts of [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1915.28s)]
*  interest. So he owns a casino, but he's still gambling. Yes, he didn't stop gambling. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1922.4s)]
*  Crypto is destabilized. The value of crypto had been eroding throughout the summer of 2022. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1926.3200000000002s)]
*  Then came a one-two punch, a leak of Alameda's unflattering balance sheet in early November. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1933.1200000000001s)]
*  And days later, Cheng Peng Zhao, head of a rival exchange, took to Twitter to question FTX's [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1939.44s)]
*  viability. This triggered a classic panic run, digital style on FTX. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1945.36s)]
*  How fast was money flowing out of FTX? In the run, you know, a billion dollars a day [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1950.9599999999998s)]
*  was leaving and billion dollars a day. This thing's gushing. Yeah, it unravels because the depositors [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1956.8799999999999s)]
*  at FTX want their money back and it's not all there. It wasn't all there in large part because [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1961.52s)]
*  the investors money intended for FTX had wound up in Bankman Freed's privately held fund, Alameda [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1967.12s)]
*  Research, more than $8 billion. Do you think he knowingly stole customers money, Sam? Put that way, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1973.68s)]
*  no. So there's another side of this. In the very beginning, if you were a crypto trader who wanted [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1981.76s)]
*  to trade on FTX and wanted to send dollars or yen or euros onto the exchange so you could buy crypto, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1987.76s)]
*  FTX couldn't get bank accounts. So Alameda Research, which could get bank accounts, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=1996.72s)]
*  created bank accounts for people to send money into so that it would go to FTX. But it was held [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2001.76s)]
*  in Alameda Research, Alameda Research bank accounts. And $8 billion something piles up inside of [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2008.0s)]
*  Alameda Research that belongs to FTX customers that never gets moved. It never gets transferred. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2015.2s)]
*  It never gets transferred. That sounds like a problem. It's a huge problem. What's the toughest [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2021.76s)]
*  question you think Sam's going to have to answer? How do you not know that $8 billion that's not [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2025.84s)]
*  yours is in your private fund? I mean, really, how do you not know? Explain. $8 billion is in [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2031.04s)]
*  your private fund that belongs to other people and you're saying you didn't know. Please explain [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2037.36s)]
*  how that's possible. Did you do that? Yeah, I did. What did he say? He said you have to understand [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2042.1599999999999s)]
*  that when it went in there, it was a rounding error that I felt like we had infinity dollars in [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2045.44s)]
*  there that I wasn't even thinking about it. I could see people watching this saying, come on, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2049.36s)]
*  guys, this is Elizabeth Holmes in cargo shorts. And this is all a ruse. Don't fall for this. This [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2052.8s)]
*  was a bad actor. It is a little different supplying phony medical information to people [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2057.76s)]
*  that might kill them. And in this case, what you're doing is possibly losing some money [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2062.6400000000003s)]
*  that belonged to crypto speculators in the Bahamas. On the other hand, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2067.84s)]
*  this is not to excuse. He shouldn't have done that. Early in the morning of November 11th, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2071.84s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried reluctantly docu-signed FTX into bankruptcy. It had taken five days for FTX to [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2077.2000000000003s)]
*  implode. You go back to the Bahamas as Pompeii is falling. What did you see when you landed? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2084.96s)]
*  I got back the day on the Friday of the collapse. It was the afternoon that Sam had signed the [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2091.44s)]
*  bankruptcy papers. And by then, they'd been a mass exodus. Most of the employees had fled [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2096.96s)]
*  and fled in such a way that it kind of a ridiculous way. They'd taken the company cars and ditched [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2103.6s)]
*  them at the airport with the keys inside. Where they were going to get the hell out of it. Nobody [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2108.4s)]
*  knew what had happened, but they were just scared that they were going to be detained by the local [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2111.44s)]
*  authorities. We drove into the lot and Sam Bankman Fried is walking loops around the parking lot. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2115.92s)]
*  He'd been brought over there earlier to be interviewed by Bahamas authorities and nobody [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2122.7200000000003s)]
*  had given him a ride home. And he was just sitting there all alone. How do you divorce Michael Lewis, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2128.16s)]
*  the empathetic human being from Michael Lewis, the journalist and author who recognizes what a [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2133.44s)]
*  third act this is? Pretty dramatic, right? If I were a better person, I would have been [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2138.8s)]
*  deeply distressed by all of this. It took about a nanosecond before I thought, oh my god, this is [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2145.52s)]
*  an incredible story. A month later, Bankman Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to New [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2151.36s)]
*  York to face federal charges that he had fraudulently used customer deposits to finance [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2157.1200000000003s)]
*  billions of dollars of venture capital investments, real estate purchases and political donations. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2162.5600000000004s)]
*  What's your response to someone who hears us and says it's a fun story and it's crypto in the [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2169.04s)]
*  Bahamas, but this is the oldest architecture of a financial collapse that's been going on for [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2173.6000000000004s)]
*  centuries? This isn't a Ponzi scheme. Like when you think of a Ponzi scheme, I don't know, Bernie [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2178.6400000000003s)]
*  Madoff, the problem is there's no real business there. The dollar coming in is being used to pay [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2183.1200000000003s)]
*  the dollar going out. And in this case, they actually had a great real business. If no one [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2189.04s)]
*  had ever cast aspersions on the business, if there hadn't been a run on customer deposits, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2195.2s)]
*  they'd still be sitting there making tons of money. Inside the Beltway, in the Hollywood [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2200.24s)]
*  Hills and in sports arenas, suddenly, if predictably, it was Sam Bankman who? He becomes [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2204.72s)]
*  toxic. Like nobody wants to talk to him. He has no friends. You watch everybody who rushed in rush [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2211.68s)]
*  out. Had Tom Brady react to this? The first reaction was very sad. It was sadness. He clearly [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2217.3599999999997s)]
*  really liked him and he really liked the hope that he brought. I mean, a lot of people wanted [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2223.12s)]
*  there to be a Sam. There is still a Sam Bankman-Friede-shaped hole in the world that [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2227.2799999999997s)]
*  now needs filling. That character would be very useful. What he represented. What he wanted to do [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2231.6s)]
*  with the resources. And Brady was, I think, crushed and I think his time has gone by and he [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2237.2s)]
*  ceased to get a really good explanation about what's happened. I think he's just like, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2242.56s)]
*  he tricked me. I'm angry. I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2249.36s)]
*  Starting in December, Lewis began driving the 45 miles from Berkeley to Stanford, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2253.76s)]
*  where Bankman-Friede was living with his parents, who have also been ensnared in [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2259.04s)]
*  legal proceedings tied to FTX. Out on bail, but wearing an ankle monitor, he left the door open [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2263.52s)]
*  for Lewis so they could continue their conversations. We anticipated speaking with Bankman-Friede in [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2270.1600000000003s)]
*  August, but the judge in his case instituted a gag order and then put him in a Brooklyn jail [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2276.4s)]
*  for violating terms of his release. Bankman-Friede has pled not guilty. He genuinely thinks he's [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2282.32s)]
*  innocent. I can tell you his state of mind four or five months ago. It's like if you offered me [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2288.7200000000003s)]
*  plead guilty and do six months of house arrest, I'd still say no. What do you suspect his biggest [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2294.4s)]
*  fear is if he has to go to prison? Not having the internet. Now that sounds crazy, but I do [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2299.6s)]
*  think that if he had the internet, he could survive jail forever. Without having a constant [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2306.24s)]
*  stream of information to react to, I think he may go mad. If you gave Sam Bankman-Friede a choice, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2310.56s)]
*  this is quite serious, of living in a $39 million penthouse in the Bahamas without the internet, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2316.9599999999996s)]
*  or the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn with the internet, there's no question in my mind [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2325.3599999999997s)]
*  he'd take the jail. Michael Lewis has never before written something that dovetails so dramatically [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2332.4s)]
*  with a sensationalized news event. Lewis's book Going Infinite comes out Tuesday, the same day [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2339.44s)]
*  Sam Bankman-Friede's trial begins. He made a mockery of crypto in the eyes of many. He's sort of [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2346.0s)]
*  taken away the credibility of effective altruism. How do you see him? Everything you say is just [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2352.56s)]
*  true. It's more interesting than that. Every cause he sought to serve, he damaged. Every cause [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2357.28s)]
*  he sought to fight, he helped. He was a person who set out in life to maximize the consequences of [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2363.52s)]
*  his actions, never mind the intent. And he had exactly the opposite effects of the ones he set [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2369.44s)]
*  out to have. So it looks to me like his life is a cruel joke. If you feel like you've been hearing [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2375.84s)]
*  a lot about Bitcoin lately, those aren't voices in your head. Last month, in an attempt to skirt [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2392.7200000000003s)]
*  harsh financial sanctions, a top Russian lawmaker said Russia may start accepting Bitcoin for oil [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2398.4s)]
*  and gas. If you watched the Super Bowl this year, you probably saw the ads for crypto companies. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2404.8s)]
*  And now President Biden has turned his attention to digital assets, signing an executive order [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2410.7200000000003s)]
*  to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. So we thought it was time to try and get our heads [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2416.8s)]
*  around the complicated world of cryptocurrencies, specifically the largest one, Bitcoin. To do that, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2423.04s)]
*  we went to one of the simplest places in the world, a remote town known as Bitcoin Beach. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2430.16s)]
*  On the coast of El Salvador, about an hour from the capital, is a town called Elzante. Black [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2439.04s)]
*  volcanic sand gives way to warm water and an exceptional point break that draws surfers from [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2445.12s)]
*  around the world. But wander down Elzante's winding dirt roads and it's easy to spot [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2451.2799999999997s)]
*  a different kind of tourist. Do you surf? I don't yet but I might take it off here. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2459.92s)]
*  We met Andreas Kohl, visiting from Liechtenstein. He came to Elzante because it's one of the first [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2465.2000000000003s)]
*  places in the world you can use Bitcoin to pay for just about anything, tamales, hotels or souvenirs. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2471.12s)]
*  Bitcoin city is happening here and it might be the next Singapore I want to see it happen. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2478.16s)]
*  Singapore? It's hard to imagine. The only traffic jams in Elzante are caused by loose livestock. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2482.88s)]
*  To understand how this remote town of 3000 became part of a grand Bitcoin experiment [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2490.2400000000002s)]
*  and how it all works, we were told to head to this break and look for a middle-aged blonde guy [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2497.36s)]
*  locals call the man. That's him, Mike Peterson, an expat from San Diego with a degree in economics [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2502.8s)]
*  and a nose for decent waves. I wound up here on a surf trip I think like 18 years ago. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2511.6800000000003s)]
*  Fell in love with the warm water, the nice waves but most especially the people here. Peterson, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2520.56s)]
*  who once worked as a financial planner, moved to Elzante a few years later and started helping [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2526.64s)]
*  those people. In 2015 he started MissionSake, a charity that supports missionaries and funded [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2531.92s)]
*  scholarships and created local jobs. At that time most young people here left town or the country [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2539.04s)]
*  to find work. That's kind of the cycle that we've seen of destruction of people having to leave [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2545.44s)]
*  because there's not enough opportunity then their kids are growing up without their parents here so [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2550.64s)]
*  they're very vulnerable to the gangs. They join the gangs, the gangs grow, even you have this kind [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2555.6s)]
*  of destructive cycle. This is how we grew up here like the opportunities were almost nothing. You [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2560.4s)]
*  had to leave if you wanted to do something. That was like the paradigm. Roman Martinez grew up in [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2568.32s)]
*  Elzante and started working with Peterson's charity to help kids like Ismael Galdemez. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2574.56s)]
*  He quit school at 13. All I wanted to do is to work hard and to live that's it, not about my future. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2580.08s)]
*  It was just surviving the day, getting through the day. Exactly as my parents did. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2587.52s)]
*  It's sad but it's the reality. But then in 2019 Elzante got an unexpected break. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2591.36s)]
*  Peterson says he was introduced to someone representing an anonymous donor [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2598.64s)]
*  with a fortune in bitcoin who wanted to see it put to good use with one stipulation. The stipulation [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2603.36s)]
*  was you can't just convert it into dollars because they believe that actual the usage of bitcoin [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2610.0s)]
*  would be what would benefit the people and so for me it was like wow this is somebody that wants to [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2615.2000000000003s)]
*  actually see a circular economy generated using bitcoin and they're willing to actually put the [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2620.32s)]
*  funds behind it. Peterson and a team of community leaders got to work creating the Bitcoin Beach [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2626.2400000000002s)]
*  initiative. They used the anonymous donation to create dozens of much needed jobs in Elzante [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2632.56s)]
*  but they'd have to pay everyone in bitcoin. Be honest what did they say when you brought up [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2638.7999999999997s)]
*  let's use bitcoin? First they just kind of looked at you with this blank stare like [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2645.2s)]
*  well show me these bitcoins and how you hold them and what do they look like? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2649.92s)]
*  All fair questions without an easy answer but Mike Peterson offered his neighbors and us his [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2655.7599999999998s)]
*  best explanation to what might be the most challenging question of all. What's bitcoin? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2661.84s)]
*  So bitcoin is the the world's first decentralized money that's not controlled by any government [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2667.84s)]
*  there's no gatekeepers in it it's you know obviously lives on the internet it can be [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2675.92s)]
*  transferred in electronic form that actually lets people own it themselves truly own it. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2680.56s)]
*  In other words it's peer-to-peer digital money there isn't a bank or third party in the middle. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2686.1600000000003s)]
*  Banks have never really been part of the equation for most Salvadorans. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2692.8s)]
*  About 70 percent of the country is unbanked that means they have limited access to loans mortgages [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2696.56s)]
*  or credit cards. Cash has always been keen which made convincing people in Elzante to work for [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2702.88s)]
*  bitcoin a currency they couldn't hold or see especially difficult. So Mike Peterson and his [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2710.0s)]
*  partners turned their attention to a group much more comfortable with all things digital [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2716.56s)]
*  teenagers Ismael Galdemez was one of the first hires. So we were hiring them to do things in [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2721.84s)]
*  the community pick up trash out of the river and then we'd pay them in bitcoin and so they got into [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2728.56s)]
*  this rhythm of going out and working and earning bitcoin. And so you're giving them the bitcoin but [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2734.56s)]
*  do they have anywhere to spend the bitcoin? That's always the challenge when you're trying to bring a [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2740.4s)]
*  new system in the place you know the chicken and the egg problem. Enter Mama Rosa under a tin roof [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2745.2s)]
*  and over an open flame she runs a popular pupusa spot in town. Her son Jorge works with Mike Peterson [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2753.04s)]
*  and convinced mama to be the first in Elzante to accept bitcoin. Did she say where is the money? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2759.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah she said like okay if you pay me but how can I see you when I touch the money? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2766.16s)]
*  And she just had to trust you? Yeah so she said if you can come and teach me. Here's how it works [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2774.0s)]
*  customers scan her QR code then using a popular phone app called bitcoin beach instantly transfer [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2780.48s)]
*  bitcoin from their wallets to hers which she keeps in her apron. Mama Rosa used her bitcoin [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2787.8399999999997s)]
*  savings to buy a truck and two cows. The grandmother of 18 is now bullish on bitcoin. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2794.24s)]
*  How do you feel about being a pioneer of technology? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2800.7999999999997s)]
*  You like it? Hola. But not everyone in town has bought in. Accept us bitcoin? No. No. Can I ask you [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2805.9199999999996s)]
*  do you accept bitcoin? No. Because bitcoin is complicated. It's not backed by a government [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2816.7999999999997s)]
*  authority. There's also concern about the computer power or energy needed to support bitcoin's [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2823.52s)]
*  underlying network. Most people don't buy a whole bitcoin but a fraction of one. It's largely [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2829.04s)]
*  unregulated and extremely volatile. There's only a limited supply so its value swells and dips based [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2834.8s)]
*  on demand. Bitcoin was introduced in 2009. A year later a single bitcoin was valued at pennies. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2841.6s)]
*  Its value inched up and down peaking last November at almost 70,000 dollars a bitcoin [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2848.48s)]
*  only to lose around 30 percent of its value in the last few months. What happens when it drops 20 [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2854.8s)]
*  percent and that's a big deal to a person or a shop owner here? Are they knocking on your door? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2861.36s)]
*  Not knocking on the door but you know they'll call Jorge and like hey what's going on and so then we'll [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2867.44s)]
*  kind of connect them with people who have been in this from the beginning. They've seen like yes [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2873.36s)]
*  there's ups and down volatilities along the way but over the long-term perspective it's going up [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2877.76s)]
*  in value against the dollar. But you're not doubling down on this because you personally can [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2883.5200000000004s)]
*  get rich. I will benefit if the price of bitcoin goes up but I can't impact that and I can't [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2888.2400000000002s)]
*  influence that. That's not the driving reason behind this. The reason is we want to see [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2894.4s)]
*  Elzante transform. This is all you? Yeah. About 45 businesses are now riding the bitcoin wave in Elzante. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2899.1200000000003s)]
*  You can pay your dentist, the electric bill or for a cup of coffee with bitcoin. So I put in two dollars [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2907.2s)]
*  and send? Yes. Mike Peterson and his partners use bitcoin to help pay for this continuing education [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2913.2s)]
*  center. There are computer and english classes. I call back later. Teachers are paid in bitcoin. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2919.4399999999996s)]
*  All of it's attracted good press, bitcoin tourists and a few hoodie-wearing tech entrepreneurs. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2928.56s)]
*  Yeah so we had gone to El Salvador just to prove that our product worked and prove that we could [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2935.68s)]
*  be better at Western Union than Western Union. Jack Mallers is a 28 year old CEO from Chicago [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2941.2s)]
*  who developed an app called Strike designed to disrupt one of the biggest businesses in El [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2948.08s)]
*  Salvador remittances money sent from overseas. Last year Salvadorans received more than seven [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2953.44s)]
*  billion dollars through services like Western Union which can charge upwards of 10 percent for [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2960.56s)]
*  a transfer that can take days. Using bitcoin's digital infrastructure known as rails the strike [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2965.92s)]
*  app allows users to send U.S. dollars across borders instantly for pennies. We launch it. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2972.48s)]
*  It gets one download a day. Then it gets a hundred downloads a day. Then it gets a thousand downloads [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2978.96s)]
*  a day. Then it gets 20,000 downloads a day. Then Mallers got an unexpected message on his phone. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2983.52s)]
*  You get a direct message on Twitter from who? The brother of the president. And he wants to meet [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2990.0s)]
*  with you. He wants to meet with me and he gave me 24 hours. El Salvador's populist president Naib [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=2996.8s)]
*  Bukele once referred to himself as the world's coolest dictator. He's been accused of illegally [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3005.28s)]
*  grabbing power and ordering soldiers to occupy the nation's legislative assembly to push through his [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3011.28s)]
*  agenda. It was scary. It was really scary. I thought there were likely two outcomes is that [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3017.36s)]
*  they were not happy with me interfering with the financial system in El Salvador or they were [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3024.08s)]
*  tremendously happy and bought into the vision that this was representative of a better world for not [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3030.6400000000003s)]
*  only El Salvador but the planet. His utopian blueprint for bitcoin led to months of conversations [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3035.1200000000003s)]
*  with the government that led to this. Last summer at a bitcoin conference in Miami, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3041.44s)]
*  Bukele announced in a video message that El Salvador would become the first country in the [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3048.16s)]
*  world to adopt bitcoin as an official currency alongside the U.S. dollar. It wasn't discussed [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3053.2000000000003s)]
*  among lawmakers or no debate. We never heard anything before that day. Luis Membreño is an [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3059.84s)]
*  economist based in San Salvador and an outspoken critic of President Bukele's policies. The [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3066.56s)]
*  government wants people to think that this can be currency but this is just an asset and a speculative [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3072.72s)]
*  asset with a huge volatility. Imagine the U.S. dollar having a volatility of 20 percent in one day [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3078.96s)]
*  would be crazy. El Salvador is billions of dollars in debt and has long relied on loans from the [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3086.32s)]
*  international monetary fund to prop up its economy. In January, the IMF expressed concern [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3092.8s)]
*  about the risk of bitcoin's volatility and has delayed further relief to El Salvador. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3099.1200000000003s)]
*  But Bukele is doubling down. He spent an estimated 400 million dollars of taxpayer money [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3104.7200000000003s)]
*  to push bitcoin into circulation. Protests followed. He's calling himself the CEO of El Salvador. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3112.0s)]
*  What kind of CEO do you think he is? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3119.6s)]
*  An irresponsible one, an immature one. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3122.64s)]
*  But isn't Bukele kind of a genius in a way because he's changed the narrative? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3125.12s)]
*  You know, we're not talking about the gang problem. We're talking about look what they've [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3129.6s)]
*  done with bitcoin. Yeah, definitely. And he's so good at it. The problem is there's going to be a [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3134.96s)]
*  day in which people will find out that the government is in debt, that they will increase [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3141.44s)]
*  taxes for everybody, and the party's over. In Elzante, 19-year-old Ismael Galdemez doesn't [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3146.72s)]

*  guys out of the ice skates. You're a shark. A bitcoin shark embraces. Ismael's planning to move [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3174.88s)]
*  his parents and siblings into this new house in Elzante later this month. He plans to pay the [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3183.52s)]

*  invented a new type of money that wasn't backed by any government or kept in any bank. There were [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3204.72s)]

*  that anybody could be a part of by downloading some free software over the internet. Today, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3217.3599999999997s)]
*  that computerized currency bitcoin is well known, though little understood. And bitcoin's popularity [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3223.12s)]
*  has inspired the creation of thousands of other types of digital money known as cryptocurrency. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3229.92s)]
*  Over the last decade, you could have made a 5 million percent profit by investing in cryptocurrency [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3236.08s)]
*  or you could have lost everything. It has been a wild ride and few people have experienced the [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3242.4s)]
*  highs and lows more than a 29 year old named Charlie Schramm. It felt like I was riding a [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3248.7200000000003s)]

*  about what would happen when eventually we have to go back down. And for me, I dealt with the ultimate [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3261.7599999999998s)]
*  going back down. You crashed hard. Crashed really hard. Charlie Schramm was once described as the [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3266.72s)]
*  last kid who'd be picked for a game of dodgeball, but he always felt comfortable around computers. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3272.9599999999996s)]

*  To this day no one has the faintest idea who the paper's author Satoshi Nakamoto is. But he or she [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3381.6s)]
*  created ingenious software that anyone in the world could download onto their computer for free. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3390.2400000000002s)]
*  The computers running the bitcoin software were then able to work together over the internet [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3397.0400000000004s)]
*  and perform functions normally handled by banks like keeping accurate records and guarding against [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3402.32s)]
*  fraud. The computers maintain a constantly updated record of transactions involving bitcoin. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3408.32s)]
*  The record is called the blockchain and it's how the network keeps track of who owns what. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3414.56s)]
*  One of the most innovative features of the system is that every computer on the network [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3420.08s)]
*  can keep a copy of this record showing every transaction ever recorded. The blockchain is [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3424.2400000000002s)]
*  stored on thousands of computers around the world. Naya Nerula is the director of the digital currency [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3429.92s)]
*  initiative at the MIT media lab. The idea behind the blockchain is that it's everywhere and everyone [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3435.28s)]
*  can look at it and verify it for themselves. And so what this means is that you get this sense of [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3442.24s)]
*  trust, you get this sense of security because everyone's watching. If you're wondering what [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3447.8399999999997s)]
*  there is to watch here it is. Bitcoin's not much to look at just letters and numbers. Why would [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3452.64s)]
*  people have trust in something that is just numbers and letters? It doesn't have anything backing it up. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3459.68s)]
*  I think to answer that question you really have to go back to sort of the roots of money and what is [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3466.0s)]
*  money. The reason that the five dollar bill in my wallet has value is because I know you'll take it [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3470.96s)]
*  from me for something. I can buy a sandwich from you with that five dollar bill. So it has value [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3476.08s)]
*  because people believe in it? Exactly and that's it. That's really it. At first bitcoin was just [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3480.4s)]
*  an interesting experiment conducted at home by computer programmers like Laszlo Hunyets. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3487.52s)]
*  Because his computer was one of the computers helping to maintain the bitcoin network, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3493.84s)]
*  Satoshi Nakamoto's software rewarded Hunyets with some bitcoin. But there wasn't much he could do [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3498.88s)]
*  with it back in 2010. So he went on an internet chat forum and asked whether anyone would be [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3504.88s)]
*  willing to buy him some pizza in exchange for 10,000 bitcoin. And somebody said hey you know I'll [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3511.36s)]
*  take you up on that offer. Here you can see the original pizzas and that's my daughter's hand. She [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3517.6800000000003s)]
*  was a year old. That pizza obtained with bitcoin by Laszlo Hunyets and enjoyed by his daughter [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3523.04s)]
*  nine years ago is believed to be the first real world transaction involving cryptocurrency. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3528.88s)]
*  Do you feel like after that that that changed people's perception of it in a way? I think it [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3535.2s)]
*  made it real for some people. I mean it certainly did for me. In the years that followed bitcoin [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3540.48s)]
*  caught on. Some merchants started accepting it and it became possible to buy and sell bitcoin [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3546.0s)]
*  for dollars through businesses called exchanges. As the market price of one bitcoin rose from zero [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3552.8s)]
*  to a dollar to a hundred dollars and more, an esoteric experiment grew into a global industry. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3560.72s)]
*  On a windswept plain in Iceland these warehouses are closely guarded at all times. We were asked [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3569.2s)]
*  not to disclose their exact location. This is one of the places where the records, the blockchains [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3575.28s)]
*  of cryptocurrencies are now kept. State-of-the-art computers work 24-7 performing calculations that [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3582.1600000000003s)]
*  safeguard the records. In industry lingo this is called a mine. This does not look like any mine [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3589.52s)]
*  I've ever been in. Yes now this is a mine of the new world. This is the new gold mine. Marco String [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3596.6400000000003s)]
*  is the CEO of a company called Genesis Mining. So there's tens of thousands of processing units [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3603.44s)]
*  in here. If you add all the computing power of all the processing units together you have more [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3609.28s)]
*  than the world's number one supercomputer. Back in New York by 2013 Charlie Shrem had finally moved [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3614.16s)]
*  his company's computers out of his parents basement. He was spending a lot of time traveling [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3622.88s)]
*  to industry conferences and talking up bitcoin. Charlie was charismatic. Charlie was funny. But [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3627.92s)]
*  could Charlie be trusted to run a business? In a new book Bitcoin Billionaires Ben Mesrick describes [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3635.6s)]
*  how BitInstance biggest investors the Winklevoss twins grew concerned that their young CEO was [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3642.08s)]
*  spending too much time traveling and partying and not paying enough attention to the details of [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3648.32s)]
*  running his company. For example Charlie knew the U.S. government was concerned about how cyber [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3654.08s)]
*  thieves and money launderers were using bitcoin. His company was required to monitor its customers [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3660.08s)]
*  and report any suspicious activity. Banks have whole departments that are supposed to do this. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3666.24s)]
*  The person at BitInstance who Charlie put in charge of it was Charlie. So you were in charge [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3672.24s)]
*  of making sure that you complied with rules and regulations regarding financial transactions. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3677.6s)]
*  Was that a good idea? No very bad idea. In 2013 Charlie had other problems too. A documentary [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3682.08s)]
*  called The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin showed what happened when the price of bitcoin rapidly rose [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3691.92s)]
*  and fell. Charlie's company and an exchange it did business with couldn't keep up with customers [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3697.7599999999998s)]
*  orders. People can't buy and sell and they can't withdraw and they can't deposit because the whole [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3703.68s)]
*  thing is just it's just a fritz. BitInstance went out of business in July 2013 a victim of [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3708.56s)]
*  bitcoin's volatile landscape and Charlie's many mistakes. I look back at myself and I say I don't [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3715.2799999999997s)]
*  even know if I would do business with myself. Essentially you're saying you couldn't be trusted [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3721.52s)]
*  then? 100 percent. Six months later in January 2014 he was returning from a trip abroad when he got [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3725.84s)]
*  stopped at passport control in Kennedy airport. I got surrounded by a whole poo poo platter of [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3733.28s)]
*  federal agents. A poo poo platter of federal agents? Like all the next year you have DEA, IRS, NYPD, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3740.0800000000004s)]
*  JFK security all of them. Federal agents had evidence that Charlie knew one of his customers [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3746.7200000000003s)]
*  was buying bitcoin and then reselling it on a website where it was used to buy illegal drugs. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3752.96s)]
*  When I got arrested the first thing I told my lawyer is I'm guilty let's make a deal because [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3758.8799999999997s)]
*  I knew immediately that I had done what they said I did. One of bitcoin's first millionaires was now [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3765.2799999999997s)]
*  one of its first felons but that didn't stop the market price of bitcoin from rising from about [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3770.8799999999997s)]
*  250 dollars when Charlie went to prison in 2015 to nearly 20 000 at the end of 2017. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3776.24s)]
*  It then plunged 84 percent before climbing back to more than 8 000 this past week. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3785.04s)]
*  Remember a bitcoin was worth less than a penny when Laszlo Hunyats first traded bitcoin for pizza [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3793.04s)]
*  nine years ago. We calculated that if Hunyats had held on to all the bitcoin he used back then [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3799.04s)]
*  to get various items much of it pizza by the time of our interview those bitcoins would have been [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3805.6800000000003s)]
*  worth 800 million dollars. Yeah. So okay sorry let me just get this straight you used to spend [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3812.0s)]
*  about 800 million dollars on pizzas. Well if you look at today's exchange rate. Are there nights you [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3818.16s)]
*  wake up like in a cold sweat where you think I could have had 800 million dollars if I hadn't [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3823.28s)]
*  bought those pizzas? I think thinking like that is is not really good for me. There's a long list of [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3828.88s)]
*  financial leaders who think bitcoin's not good for anyone. Lail Brainard one of the governors of the [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3835.04s)]
*  federal reserve agreed to speak with us because she wanted to make sure ordinary investors [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3840.56s)]
*  understand the risks of cryptocurrency. There are people who say that cryptocurrency it's better [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3845.68s)]
*  than real currency because it's not controlled by any government and it means it's not subject to [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3851.44s)]
*  manipulation by central bankers like you no offense. The U.S. currency has a whole set of [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3856.16s)]
*  legal protections around it the federal reserve and ultimately the U.S. treasury stand behind it [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3863.36s)]
*  and when you hold your dollars in a bank account you have deposit insurance. And that doesn't [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3868.72s)]
*  exist with cryptocurrencies? None of those accountability mechanisms exist for bitcoin. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3872.7999999999997s)]
*  Charlie Shrem spent a year in prison when he got out the man once described as bitcoin moses [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3880.08s)]
*  worked in a restaurant parting seas of dirty dishes for eight dollars an hour [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3887.2799999999997s)]
*  but like bitcoin Charlie Shrem bounced back. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3891.84s)]
*  Three years after getting out of prison he's living very comfortably in Florida. He told us [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3899.2000000000003s)]
*  he's made money blogging consulting and investing in cryptocurrency and is now [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3904.4s)]
*  captain of his own destiny. He's even got a boat named Satoshi after bitcoin's mysterious creator. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3911.2000000000003s)]
*  After watching this you may be wondering why the world needs cryptocurrencies. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3918.24s)]
*  Neha Nerula of MIT's digital currency initiative argues they can make a difference. The thing that [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3923.36s)]
*  excites me about cryptocurrencies is that we can experiment with the transfer of value. We can put [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3929.6s)]
*  new features into money we can change the way money works. She says cryptocurrency has already [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3935.04s)]
*  helped people in countries like Venezuela where the monetary system is in crisis and in the future [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3940.16s)]
*  it may be able to do things like speed up and lower the cost of worldwide money transfers. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3946.16s)]
*  People used to say why do we need email? I can just call someone on the phone and now we can't [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3952.08s)]
*  live without it. So this is one of those conversations that 20 years from now someone [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3958.16s)]
*  could replay and have a good laugh because I'm asking such moronic questions that will be so [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3963.52s)]
*  obvious to everybody. Or they'll be laughing at me because I said cryptocurrencies were going to [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3969.6s)]
*  be a thing and they totally flamed out and died. It still could go either way. It could really go [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3974.96s)]
*  either way. That's what makes it so exciting and interesting. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSh_KzcY_dA&t=3979.36s)]
