# Notre Dame; Smith Island; Kate Winslet; Welcome to the Wedding | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw)
*  Tonight, 60 Minutes brings you on a tour of the restoration of Notre Dame. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=0.0s)]
*  Since more than eight centuries, this cathedral was here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=13.16s)]
*  It resisted to two world wars, so many battles and campaigns. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=18.32s)]
*  The decision to rebuild Notre Dame, it was about our capacity to save, restore, sometimes [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=22.68s)]
*  reinvent what we are by preserving where we come from. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=28.48s)]
*  This is a message of achievement. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=33.12s)]
*  Smith Island is a tapestry of marshland, winding creeks and mudflats. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=38.6s)]
*  Waterfowl outnumber people here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=43.56s)]
*  Then again, the population, having dwindled by more than half since the 1990s, hovers [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  around 200. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=50.72s)]
*  With no airport or bridge, everything, groceries, utility workers, doctors, even the pastor, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=52.7s)]
*  comes by boat. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=58.36s)]
*  Life on the island must abide by Mother Nature's fickle nature. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=59.96s)]
*  If the weather is bad, you're stuck. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=64.12s)]
*  When we met Kate Winslet last month outside London, we found the actress to be remarkably [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=69.4s)]
*  un-Hollywood and capable of sounding remarkably, well, un-British. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=75.84s)]
*  She's probably lying at the bottom of the Delaware River right now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  And why is it Philly so hard? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=86.04s)]
*  It's actually the I sound in the Philadelphia and the Delco dialect that is really difficult. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=87.76s)]
*  They don't say, that's nice. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=93.32s)]
*  They say, that's nice. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=96.08s)]
*  I like your bike. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=97.72s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=101.96s)]
*  I'm Bill Whittaker. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=103.48s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=104.8s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=107.44s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=108.64s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on this special 90-minute edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=111.4s)]
*  Next Sunday, the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris will open to the public [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=117.72s)]
*  for the first time since April 2019, when a devastating fire nearly destroyed the Great [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=130.36s)]
*  Gothic Church. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=136.44s)]
*  Two formal Masses will be celebrated, and then as many as 40,000 visitors a day will [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=137.96s)]
*  begin streaming through. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=143.88s)]
*  What they will see is something of a modern miracle. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=146.04s)]
*  Notre Dame has been rebuilt and restored five years after the world watched it burn. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=149.56s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we were given unique access inside the cathedral as workers and artists [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=155.72s)]
*  applied the final touches. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=162.28s)]
*  Many people deserve credit for the resurrection of Notre Dame, but none more than French President [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  You made a promise the day after Notre Dame burned in 2019, and you said, quote, we will [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=173.84s)]
*  rebuild Notre Dame more beautiful than before, and I want it done in the next five years. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=180.86s)]
*  Did you have any doubts when you said that that might be possible? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=188.84s)]
*  If you have a doubt, it's already over. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=194.72s)]
*  Someone we spoke to called it a moonshot moment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=197.56s)]
*  This five years was a sort of new frontier. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=200.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  It's perfectly true. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=204.44s)]
*  When I announced the five years, all the experts, a lot of people just made comments to say [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=205.44s)]
*  he's crazy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=211.32s)]
*  So what gave you the confidence while Notre Dame was still smoking it? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=212.6s)]
*  I saw these guys, these firemen. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, just going beyond their own capacities with such energy and commitment. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=223.0s)]
*  I think this is exactly, this is sort of the metaphor of what our societies, and especially [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=229.08s)]
*  our democracies, need. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=235.48s)]
*  Make possible the unthinkable. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=239.24s)]
*  We are all very proud of what we have done together. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=243.64s)]
*  Last year, President Macron appointed Philippe Jost to lead the team restoring Notre Dame. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=248.2s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we met him just inside what was still an active construction zone. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=254.32s)]
*  What words come to mind when you first walk in? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=260.52s)]
*  The light is very breathtaking, and the space. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=264.76s)]
*  In this monument, there is a soul. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=270.96s)]
*  A soul. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=274.0s)]
*  A soul. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=275.0s)]
*  And we feel that when we enter now, we feel that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=276.0s)]
*  To walk into Notre Dame today is to see no sign of 2019. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=282.28s)]
*  Then the cathedral's nave was littered with burnt wood and stone rubble, a gaping hole [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  in the ceiling where the flaming spire crashed through. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  Even when we visited in 2023, a dense forest of scaffolding remained. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  Now it is open and airy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=304.52s)]
*  Every stone shines. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=307.79999999999995s)]
*  Every stained glass window is polished. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=309.76s)]
*  Every masterpiece glows, all topped by a new spire and a new roof, replacing the utter [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=312.92s)]
*  destruction of five years ago. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=319.82s)]
*  We had the big vault there to rebuild. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=322.92s)]
*  So there was a gaping hole? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=327.8s)]
*  A big hole there. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=329.68s)]
*  When President Macron said five years, we knew that this point here was the most challenging [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  space of the restoration. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  If Philippe Jost is now commander-in-chief of the restoration, Philippe Villeneuve remains [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=345.32s)]
*  its artistic director. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=351.0s)]
*  Chief architect of the cathedral since well before the fire, we saw him in 2023 supervising [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=353.24s)]
*  every detail and every artisan. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=360.08s)]
*  You also told us that rebuilding Notre Dame was in a way rebuilding yourself after the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  fire. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=371.35999999999996s)]
*  Do you feel rebuilt now? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=372.64s)]
*  Yes, Villeneuve told us. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=375.36s)]
*  Today I can watch images of the fire, see the spire falling into the flames. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=378.64s)]
*  It's something I couldn't watch before. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=389.72s)]
*  Last year Villeneuve supervised the construction of a new wooden spire and its lead covering [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=394.48s)]
*  and designed a new rooster, a symbol of the French people, for its very peak. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=400.24s)]
*  It was put in place last December. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=405.16s)]
*  When I saw the spire and the lead roof appear, Villeneuve said, when we put the rooster and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=412.28000000000003s)]
*  the cross in place, I felt that a wound had been closed. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=418.08s)]
*  Since more than eight centuries this cathedral was here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=423.76s)]
*  It resisted to two world wars, so many battles and campaigns. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=428.91999999999996s)]
*  The decision to rebuild Notre Dame was about our capacity to save, restore, sometimes reinvent [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=433.32s)]
*  what we are by preserving where we come from. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=440.44s)]
*  This is a message of achievement. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=443.76s)]
*  Many of the achievements, like the new spire and roof, are massive. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=446.24s)]
*  Notre Dame's huge bells were removed after the fire for cleaning and repair, then returned [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=451.2s)]
*  and tested a few weeks ago. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=456.6s)]
*  Its organ, with 8,000 pipes, the largest in France, was also removed, repaired and reinstalled. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=463.12s)]
*  The day we were there, an organist filled the cathedral with thunderous, soaring sound. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=475.76s)]
*  Somehow small achievements feel just as noteworthy. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=491.64s)]
*  Outside, workmen dangling on ropes to hammer wood into place, and carefully cementing paving [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=495.48s)]
*  stones. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=505.79999999999995s)]
*  Inside, delicately applying wax to ancient wood, ensuring that every light bulb is lit [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=506.79999999999995s)]
*  and every floor polished. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=515.04s)]
*  Our job is mostly to bring back all the value of mural painting. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=517.72s)]
*  Painting Restorer Diana Castillo has been working in the many small chapels of Notre [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=523.3s)]
*  Dame, where centuries ago murals were painted onto stone walls and ceilings. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=528.56s)]
*  We had a lot of work to clean them. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=534.76s)]
*  Diana shared photos and video of what the chapels and paintings looked like when she [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=537.96s)]
*  and other restorers began their work after the fire, cloudy and dim, and their appearance [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=543.4s)]
*  now after cleaning. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=550.36s)]
*  So we did one chapel after another, after another, and after we finished the cleaning [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=553.52s)]
*  process. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=558.84s)]
*  It was really almost one year. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=561.1600000000001s)]
*  We were like, OK, now we can see the paint, now we can appreciate it and start the restoration. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=565.1600000000001s)]
*  So you were not just removing the soot from the fire, but you were removing the grime [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=573.1600000000001s)]
*  from centuries. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=578.44s)]
*  Exactly, exactly, exactly. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=579.88s)]
*  From 1850, actually. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=581.64s)]
*  Many of them had never been touched since 1850, so you imagine, 170 years. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=583.6s)]
*  Today, the murals are gleaming. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=589.36s)]
*  Ceilings show starry nights of deep blue and gold, and stone columns that had been gray [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=592.52s)]
*  are now kaleidoscopes of color. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=598.72s)]
*  And you have brought those colors back to life. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=601.8000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely, yes, and I'm sure many people will be shocked. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=604.04s)]
*  And the result like this is very satisfying for us, of course. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=607.72s)]
*  Similar transformations are everywhere in the new Notre Dame. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=611.76s)]
*  The wooden walls and ceilings that had been dark and gloomy seem to shine, and so do the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=615.9599999999999s)]
*  many marble statues and decorative metalworks. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=621.56s)]
*  The workers and craftspeople who have pulled all this off are known as companions, and [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=625.1999999999999s)]
*  their work is celebrated on huge banners overlooking the River Seine. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=630.8399999999999s)]
*  We've heard of something called the Notre Dame Effect, which is young people being drawn [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=635.8399999999999s)]
*  to traditional crafts and trades because of the work they're doing and seeing being done [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=642.32s)]
*  here at the cathedral. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=649.4000000000001s)]
*  Have you witnessed that? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=651.36s)]
*  It's true, Philippe Villeneuve told us, that Notre Dame was a formidable school for all [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=658.2s)]
*  the different crafts, carpenters, metalworkers, stone carvers, painters. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=663.6s)]
*  All these kinds of jobs were boosted by the restoration. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=669.16s)]
*  I visited the site a few times, and each time what's dropping the most was the commitment [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=673.0799999999999s)]
*  and the joy and the responsibility of the companions that I met. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=679.0799999999999s)]
*  Anne-Diess Griffin was born in France and educated in the U.S., where she runs an investment [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=683.28s)]
*  firm. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=689.16s)]
*  She has helped mobilize financial support in America to revitalize Notre Dame. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=690.1999999999999s)]
*  Why do you think this symbol of Paris and of France inspires such strong feelings, not [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=696.24s)]
*  just here, but in the U.S. and around the world? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=704.24s)]
*  Notre Dame symbolizes something universal, and that's something to be cherished. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=709.24s)]
*  Anne's contribution to the restoration effort was one of the largest from anyone in the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=714.24s)]
*  U.S. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=720.24s)]
*  The support from Americans was just tremendous. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=721.24s)]
*  There were over 45,000 donors who contributed funds to the cathedral for a sum of over [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=724.28s)]
*  $57 million. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=731.28s)]
*  So we should be incredibly proud of that. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=732.28s)]
*  Every penny of that has been needed. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=735.28s)]
*  The total cost of restoring Notre Dame is nearing a billion dollars, including, Philippe [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=737.28s)]
*  Jos told us, for measures to prevent another tragedy. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=744.28s)]
*  So you have new fire detection, new fire suppression systems that have all been installed? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=748.3199999999999s)]
*  Installed in the roof. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  So that would prevent another catastrophe like this from ever happening again? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=759.3199999999999s)]
*  We are very confident in that. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  It will not happen again. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  Jos also expressed confidence that rebuilding the new Notre Dame, using the old materials [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=770.3199999999999s)]
*  of wood and stone and lead, will help it to last. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=776.36s)]
*  The cathedral is 860 years old, and we will restore it for 860 years. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=780.36s)]
*  That it will last another 860 years. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=789.36s)]
*  And perhaps more. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=794.36s)]
*  Architect Philippe Villeneuve championed the use of traditional materials, especially to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=796.36s)]
*  build the towering new spire just as the old one had been constructed. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=801.4s)]
*  But he let us in on a secret. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=806.4s)]
*  There is one new touch up there. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=809.4s)]
*  I left a small mark of myself, he told us. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=817.4s)]
*  In one of the hooks of the new spire is my face, with an admiring and affectionate look [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=820.4s)]
*  to represent all the companions who rebuilt the cathedral. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=826.4s)]
*  How are you? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=831.4s)]
*  Bonjour Monsieur le President. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=832.4s)]
*  President Macron visited Notre Dame while we were there, when it was still buzzing with [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=834.4s)]
*  preparations for opening day. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=839.4s)]
*  It's impressive and very moving to see that we still have dozens of people working hard [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=841.4s)]
*  to finish the job. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=850.4s)]
*  And as Notre Dame's great doors reopen, might that spirit be even a little bit contagious? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=852.4s)]
*  There's a lot of political division here in France as there is in the United States. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=860.4399999999999s)]
*  So in this climate, how important is it to have a project like this that unifies rather [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=865.4399999999999s)]
*  than divides? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=874.4399999999999s)]
*  We speak about moments of unity and pride. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=876.4399999999999s)]
*  And this is exactly what our nations need, especially in that times. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  We should try to consider this type of moment and great projects and think, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=884.48s)]
*  if we're already unable to do so, why don't we try to fix other, perhaps more abstract [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=889.48s)]
*  but very important big issues of our countries? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=896.48s)]
*  So the impossible is not impossible, huh? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=900.48s)]
*  Definitely, it's the French motto. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=903.48s)]
*  Impossible is not French. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=905.48s)]
*  Smith Island doesn't sit in the middle of Chesapeake Bay so much as it bobs there. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=914.48s)]
*  Time marches on while the land recedes, turning to marsh as sea levels rise, storms come [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=920.48s)]
*  fierce, and erosion unleashes its ground gate. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=926.48s)]
*  We talk often about what climate change does to faraway continents, countries, and cities. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=929.48s)]
*  But its impact in the U.S. might be felt most sharply in a small coastal community, a Maryland [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=934.48s)]
*  island struggling to survive, where crabs are plentiful, crime is non-existent, and [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=941.52s)]
*  the residents who trace their lineage and dialect back to the 1600s might be among this [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=947.52s)]
*  country's first climate refugees. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=953.52s)]
*  Not even 100 miles from D.C. and Baltimore, Smith Island is a tapestry of marshland, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=958.52s)]
*  winding creeks, and mudflats. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=963.52s)]
*  Waterfowl outnumber people here. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=965.52s)]
*  Then again, the population, having dwindled by more than half since the 1990s, hovers [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=968.56s)]
*  around 200. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=973.56s)]
*  With no airport or bridge, everything, groceries, utility workers, doctors, even the pastor, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=974.56s)]
*  comes by boat 40 minutes from the mainland. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=980.56s)]
*  Life on the island must abide by Mother Nature's fickle nature, tides, winds. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=983.56s)]
*  If the weather is bad, you're stuck. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=990.56s)]
*  Love people, love doing what I do, make cakes, crab cakes. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=992.56s)]
*  So it is that native Smith Islanders like Mary Ada Marshall persist on a combination [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=996.5999999999999s)]
*  of spine, heart, and guts. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1002.5999999999999s)]
*  How do you characterize this place to people who have never been here? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1004.5999999999999s)]
*  All right, well, I've been here my entire life. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1007.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't feel isolated, but people that come here sometimes, they feel like, I can't get [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1009.5999999999999s)]
*  off, I can't get to my car. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1015.5999999999999s)]
*  We learn we're survivors. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1017.5999999999999s)]
*  We learn how to adapt with the weather. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1019.5999999999999s)]
*  It's like a big family. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1022.5999999999999s)]
*  But let me tell you something, if you do wrong, everybody knows it too. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1024.6399999999999s)]
*  Here, the school bus floats. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1027.6399999999999s)]
*  The ambulance flies. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1030.6399999999999s)]
*  Incomes are modest. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1032.6399999999999s)]
*  This is part of the poorest county in Maryland. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1034.6399999999999s)]
*  The citizens live by an unwritten code based on personal morality. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1036.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm wondering what role faith plays on Smith Island. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1041.6399999999999s)]
*  Big part. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1046.6399999999999s)]
*  That's the government of our island. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1047.6399999999999s)]
*  It really is. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1050.6399999999999s)]
*  It really is. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1051.68s)]
*  We don't really have government much. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1052.68s)]
*  I mean, we don't have any law. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1054.68s)]
*  We don't need it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1057.68s)]
*  We don't want to be a crime. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1058.68s)]
*  No crime. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1059.68s)]
*  The speed limit's a golf cart. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1062.68s)]
*  I mean, how fast can you go in a golf cart? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1064.68s)]
*  And here, I feel so safe. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1066.68s)]
*  I do. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1069.68s)]
*  I mean, I just feel like if I need anything, that I can pick up my phone. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1070.68s)]
*  And I don't care what anybody's doing. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1075.68s)]
*  They'll come and say, what's the matter? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1077.68s)]
*  What do you need? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1078.68s)]
*  That's golden. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1079.68s)]
*  And you've got to have a lot of faith to live right here in the middle of this bay. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1080.72s)]
*  The island was first chartered by Captain John Smith in 1608. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1084.72s)]
*  Today, most residents can draw a direct line to the first Smith Islanders to brave a life here. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1089.72s)]
*  Tyler, Evans, Marshall. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1095.72s)]
*  The same last names adorning the weather gravestones adorn the mailboxes now. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1098.72s)]
*  Among those born and raised here, Eddie Summers and Mark Kitching. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1103.72s)]
*  How far do your families go back? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1107.72s)]
*  My grandmother, grandmother Kitching was originally in Evans, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1109.76s)]
*  and she goes back to the Tyler and Evans way back. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1114.76s)]
*  1785, on the Tyler and Evans part of me. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1118.76s)]
*  And Summers came in 1870, around 1870. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1124.76s)]
*  Here, the past courses through the blood and also the brogue. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1128.76s)]
*  Linguists come to study the singular accent, part Elizabethan English, part Southern. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1132.76s)]
*  Can we talk about the accent? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1138.8s)]
*  You know what I tell people about our accent? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1140.8s)]
*  I'll say, we were here first, you all screwed it up. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1142.8s)]
*  The accent is original, and so is the signature Smith Island backwards talk, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1146.8s)]
*  saying the opposite of what you mean. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1151.8s)]
*  It's about timing, tone, and it's best left to the locals. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1153.8s)]
*  I walk off the boat and I say, Smith Island isn't anything special. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1157.8s)]
*  How does that get received? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1161.8s)]
*  I hope, Tyler, to get back on the boat. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1163.8s)]
*  Also learning the lingo, Shannon Abbott, a newcomer from New Jersey. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1168.8s)]
*  I made our neighbors a casserole, I don't know, a few weeks ago, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1172.8s)]
*  and they said, that ain't fair. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1177.8s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, that means it's good. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1181.8s)]
*  How do you explain this place to people from South Jersey? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1184.8s)]
*  It's like that feeling when you were a kid, like that first day of summer vacation. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1187.8s)]
*  And you're like, hmm, what am I going to do today? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1192.8s)]
*  I'm going to go find bugs, make mud pies, whatever it is, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1194.8s)]
*  stay out till the fireflies are out at night. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1197.84s)]
*  That's what this place is to me. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1201.84s)]
*  Transports you back to being a girl. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1203.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1205.84s)]
*  Time has largely been frozen here for centuries. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1206.84s)]
*  The economy and everything else on Smith Island was and is based in on and around the water. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1209.84s)]
*  The skipjack sailors of Chesapeake Bay, who propelled only by sail, hunt the oyster. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1216.84s)]
*  Walter Cronkite saw romance in Smith Island and its watermen. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1222.84s)]
*  That was 1965. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1226.8799999999999s)]
*  Not much about this culture has changed since. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1230.8799999999999s)]
*  Same methods, same rhythms. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1233.8799999999999s)]
*  Crabs in the summer, oysters in the winter. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1235.8799999999999s)]
*  Modern day watermen like Mark Kitching see the job, yes, as a means of income, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1238.8799999999999s)]
*  but also as an inheritance. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1243.8799999999999s)]
*  What do watermen mean to this community? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1246.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, going back, you know, you go back seven to five years ago, that's all it was. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1249.8799999999999s)]
*  There was no other thing but watermen. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1254.92s)]
*  How many watermen now? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1257.92s)]
*  We're down to about 20. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1259.92s)]
*  By the turn of this century, fear surfaced that Smith Island might not last another century. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1261.92s)]
*  Better job opportunities on the mainland caused an exodus. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1267.92s)]
*  There are now so few children, the island's only school recently closed. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1271.92s)]
*  According to the Army Corps of Engineers, erosion eats away up to 12 feet of shoreline a year, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1276.92s)]
*  and the bay is trespassing on homes. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1282.96s)]
*  Rising tides that don't lift boats. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1285.96s)]
*  In 2013, concerned about the island's bleak and vulnerable future, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1288.96s)]
*  the state of Maryland earmarked $1 million, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1293.96s)]
*  encouraging residents to relocate to the mainland. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1296.96s)]
*  The deal? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1299.96s)]
*  We'll buy your property and tear down the buildings. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1300.96s)]
*  The homes on them had to be demolished and nothing could ever be built on them. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1303.96s)]
*  And so that's the death of Smith Island. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1310.0s)]
*  Surprisingly, or maybe not, community has always outweighed money here. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1315.0s)]
*  Not one resident took the easy payout, and the state abandoned the plan. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1320.0s)]
*  What was your reaction the first time you heard about the buyout offers that were coming from the government? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1325.0s)]
*  You really want to know? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1330.0s)]
*  I said, I ain't going nowhere, just like everybody else. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1331.0s)]
*  Still, the moment was the equivalent of a foghorn blowing. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1335.0s)]
*  A warning. Smith Island needed saving. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1339.04s)]
*  Suddenly, watermen and retirees were learning how to apply for grants and lobby state legislators. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1342.04s)]
*  And they've been strikingly successful, receiving more than $43 million for elevating roads, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1348.04s)]
*  building jetties, restoring buildings, and drawing in tourists. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1356.04s)]
*  But the environmentalists and climate scientists we consulted worry that even Smith Island grit [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1361.04s)]
*  is no match for a rapidly changing environment. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1367.08s)]
*  Here we are getting to see a major thoroughfare on Smith Island. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1370.08s)]
*  Hilary Harp Falk is the CEO of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1375.08s)]
*  She lives in Annapolis and travels all around the mid-Atlantic, fighting to preserve the bay. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1379.08s)]
*  But her work around Smith Island is personal. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1385.08s)]
*  This is where she spent her childhood summers. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1388.08s)]
*  These pelicans we see. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1391.08s)]
*  You're saying these weren't here when you were a girl? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1394.12s)]
*  No, so these nesting pelicans have been moving north. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1397.12s)]
*  They're summering now in more northern places. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1400.12s)]
*  As a result, a changing climate. Correct. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1404.12s)]
*  How does the rising sea level here at Chesapeake Bay compare to other bodies of water? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1407.12s)]
*  Right now, we're expecting in Maryland to see an increase in sea level rise by 1 to 2 feet by 2050 [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1412.12s)]
*  and more than 4 feet by 2100. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1421.1599999999999s)]
*  For the record, that means the bay has the highest rate of sea level rise on the East Coast. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1424.1599999999999s)]
*  The water that has sustained places like Smith Island has now become a threat. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1430.1599999999999s)]
*  Explain why we have this high rate of sea level here. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1435.1599999999999s)]
*  Mostly because it's really low-lying. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1440.1599999999999s)]
*  We have that. We also are seeing issues of erosion as well as issues of subsidence. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1442.1599999999999s)]
*  Some of the land is actually sinking. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1447.2s)]
*  Some environmental scientists will say that Smith Island could be some of the first climate refugees in the country. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1450.2s)]
*  I think we're seeing with the projections, they could be right. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1457.2s)]
*  What does that tell you about the people who did stay? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1462.2s)]
*  If you ask them, it would be because this is home. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1465.2s)]
*  It would be asking someone to leave their home or their hometown, to leave whole histories. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1468.2s)]
*  I think when you spend time here, there's a saying that you get mud between your toes. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1474.24s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1479.24s)]
*  It means that Smith Island never leaves you. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1481.24s)]
*  That you will always be connected to this place. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1484.24s)]
*  For those of us that have mud between our toes, I think we can understand what it means to not have Smith Island anymore. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1487.24s)]
*  And it's not just an abstract concern. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1497.24s)]
*  Holland Island, just 10 miles north, was once bustling. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1500.28s)]
*  But erosion came, people left, and now names on gravestones are the only indication of what once was. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1503.28s)]
*  Nevertheless, the Smith Island locals say grim projections have always been part of life here. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1510.28s)]
*  When I was a little girl, they used to say, the island's a-sinking. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1516.28s)]
*  Now this weren't yesterday, this has been a long time ago. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1519.28s)]
*  Well, fast forward 60, 70 years, we're still here, you know. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1522.28s)]
*  Besides, they pride themselves on adapting to meet challenges. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1526.32s)]
*  Mark Kitching isn't driving an Uber to supplement his income. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1530.32s)]
*  He's using his boat to host eco tours around the Pelican Rookery. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1534.32s)]
*  Mary Ada Marshall runs her business out of her kitchen, making Smith Island cakes. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1539.32s)]
*  Once baked by the island's women to sustain their husbands during the oyster harvest, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1545.32s)]
*  these eight-layer confections are now celebrated as the Maryland state dessert. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1550.36s)]
*  Mary Ada takes orders by phone and then ships her creations off-island to just about anywhere. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1555.36s)]
*  Well, I did one for Okinawa and one for Iran, and they got there. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1562.36s)]
*  And I don't take a cent until they get their cake, then they mail me a check. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1568.36s)]
*  They don't have to pay in advance? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1572.36s)]
*  I don't have no credit card machine or nothing, no. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1574.36s)]
*  And it's not just that the natives won't give up. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1578.3999999999999s)]
*  Despite the specter of sea level rise, there's been a real estate boom here. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1581.3999999999999s)]
*  20% of the homes on the island have changed hands in the past three years. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1585.3999999999999s)]
*  A chance at affordable island life and optimism about the government's infrastructure investment [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1590.3999999999999s)]
*  have led folks like Shannon Abbott to defy the warnings for a slice of Smith Island charm. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1596.3999999999999s)]
*  Does the isolation worry you at all? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1602.3999999999999s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1604.3999999999999s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1606.44s)]
*  Because back home, I'm just the street address. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1608.44s)]
*  Here, I'm Shannon. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1611.44s)]
*  Moving here, I made a difference right away, just by moving here. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1614.44s)]
*  Because we were having dinner with our neighbors, she said, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1618.44s)]
*  it's so great just seeing the lights on. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1621.44s)]
*  You know, because for years it would just, you know, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1624.44s)]
*  they would see people move away and the house go dark. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1628.44s)]
*  She and her husband paid $80,000 for this waterfront home they are now rebuilding, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1631.48s)]
*  not just as a place to live out their days, but as a legacy. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1636.48s)]
*  Did you elevate this? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1641.48s)]
*  We did. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1642.48s)]
*  Let's be clear, this is no weekend house. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1643.48s)]
*  This is no weekend house. This is it. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1645.48s)]
*  We have four kids, a grandson, and we're hoping that they will be able to bring their grandchildren and their grandchildren here. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1647.48s)]
*  How do you reconcile hearing these pretty grim reports [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1655.52s)]
*  with your desire to make this a generational house? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1658.52s)]
*  Five years ago, we never thought we would have a pandemic and live through COVID. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1662.52s)]
*  I mean, things can change tomorrow. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1668.52s)]
*  So why worry about it? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1670.52s)]
*  We can live in New Jersey where it's safe, or we can say, forget it, let's really live. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1672.52s)]
*  Let's be passionate about what time we have left. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1679.52s)]
*  And who cares if we only have 100 years left or 75 years left? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1683.56s)]
*  It doesn't matter because something could come tomorrow and it'll all be gone anyway. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1688.56s)]
*  Kate Winslet was just 20 years old when she was plucked from relative obscurity to star in Titanic. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1704.56s)]
*  She's had her pick of lead roles ever since. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1710.6s)]
*  Film critics we spoke to compare her to greats like Katharine Hepburn and Meryl Streep. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1713.6s)]
*  Winslet has a propensity for playing tough, angst-ridden women, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1718.6s)]
*  and that's exactly who she becomes in her latest film, Lee, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1722.6s)]
*  which she also produced about American photographer Lee Miller, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1726.6s)]
*  one of the few female journalists on the front lines of World War II. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1730.6s)]
*  We met Winslet last month at the theater where she performed as a teenager. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1734.6s)]
*  And found her to be remarkably un-Hollywood. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1739.6399999999999s)]
*  She drove herself to the interview, showed up alone, and dropped a few F-bombs. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1742.6399999999999s)]
*  Well the idea of going back on this stage still terrifies me. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1749.6399999999999s)]
*  So how do you get over the nerves? What do you tell yourself? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1752.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, honestly, it's a whole bunch of mind-f*****. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1755.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean it is even to this day. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1759.6399999999999s)]
*  It's like anything, going for a job interview. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1762.6399999999999s)]
*  It's absolutely terrifying if it's a job you really want. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1764.6399999999999s)]
*  Doubly terrifying. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1767.68s)]
*  You said on the first day you walk in and think, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1768.68s)]
*  everyone is in here thinking, why did they cast her? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1772.68s)]
*  Yeah, that... Oh my God. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1775.68s)]
*  You are an Oscar-winning actress. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1777.68s)]
*  So what? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1780.68s)]
*  When I was doing Lee, I would sit there and I would say, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1781.68s)]
*  this is ridiculous. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1784.68s)]
*  I can truly think of at least five other brilliant actresses [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1785.68s)]
*  who would have played this part much better than me. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1788.68s)]
*  Like a lot better. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1790.68s)]
*  And often I will turn to another crew member and I'll say, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1791.68s)]
*  they just read the wrong name off the list. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1794.68s)]
*  I'm telling you, they didn't mean for me to be here. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1796.72s)]
*  And I will have days where... [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1799.72s)]
*  Meryl's coming out of the back door now to take your role. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1801.72s)]
*  Welcome, come on in. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1804.72s)]
*  Delighted to have you. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1805.72s)]
*  You must be Lee Miller. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1807.72s)]
*  It's a war zone, Colonel. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1809.72s)]
*  Just Lee is fine. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1811.72s)]
*  That role that caused Kate Winslet so much angst [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1813.72s)]
*  was for the movie, Lee. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1817.72s)]
*  She didn't just star in it, she made it, her first as a producer. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1819.72s)]
*  How much time did you spend at this house? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1823.76s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1826.76s)]
*  I mean, a lot of time across seven years, yeah. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1827.76s)]
*  Those years were spent at Lee Miller's estate [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1831.76s)]
*  in the English countryside, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1834.76s)]
*  where she lived with her husband, a British painter. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1835.76s)]
*  It's where, with the help of Miller's son, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1838.76s)]
*  Winslet scoured the archives [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1841.76s)]
*  and decided to focus Miller's life story, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1843.76s)]
*  not on her history as a mother, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1845.76s)]
*  but on her life as a mother. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1847.76s)]
*  She was a great actress, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1849.76s)]
*  not on her history as a model who had many lovers. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1851.8s)]
*  We don't hire older models. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1854.8s)]
*  Don't blow a gasket. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1856.8s)]
*  I'm not a model anymore. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1858.8s)]
*  But as a troubled woman who in her late 30s [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1860.8s)]
*  left her glamorous life to become a war photographer, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1863.8s)]
*  capturing some of the most haunting images from World War II, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1866.8s)]
*  including some of the first uses of napalm [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1870.8s)]
*  and Nazi concentration camps, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1873.8s)]
*  Winslet says she knew it wouldn't be an easy sell. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1875.8s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1879.84s)]
*  what some of those phone calls were like. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1880.84s)]
*  There was one potential investor who said to me, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1882.84s)]
*  why should I like this woman? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1884.84s)]
*  I mean, she's drunk. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1885.84s)]
*  She's, you know, she's like loud. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1886.84s)]
*  She's like, I mean, he just probably stopped short [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1889.84s)]
*  of saying she has wrinkles on her face. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1893.84s)]
*  You had a director say something like, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1895.84s)]
*  I'll get your little Lee funded. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1898.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1900.84s)]
*  You want to share names now? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1901.84s)]
*  No, never, never, no. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1902.84s)]
*  That's not my vibe. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1903.84s)]
*  No. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1904.84s)]
*  No, but so this director did say, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1905.84s)]
*  yeah, tell you what, if you be in my film, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1907.8799999999999s)]
*  I'll help you get your little Lee Miller film made. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1909.8799999999999s)]
*  And he actually went like that. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1912.8799999999999s)]
*  And I was like, might just have lost signal. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1914.8799999999999s)]
*  Oop. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1917.8799999999999s)]
*  She didn't make the movie with those men. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1918.8799999999999s)]
*  Instead, she insisted on bringing in a female director, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1920.8799999999999s)]
*  co-producer and writers. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1923.8799999999999s)]
*  Winslet was intimately involved in every step of production. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1930.8799999999999s)]
*  As we saw during a scoring session last spring. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1934.92s)]
*  Kate? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1942.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1943.92s)]
*  It doesn't feel too loud to you, does it? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1944.92s)]
*  Well, it's funny. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1946.92s)]
*  OK, it's too loud. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1947.92s)]
*  Let's do it again. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1949.92s)]
*  She also enlisted a historian to make an exact replica [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1950.92s)]
*  of Miller's camera and really took pictures [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1954.92s)]
*  while she was acting. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1957.92s)]
*  Why did you feel like you had to learn this craft? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1958.92s)]
*  It couldn't just be a prop. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1963.96s)]
*  It needed to feel like an extension of my arms. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1965.96s)]
*  I had to be confident and comfortable with it. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1968.96s)]
*  And in order to do that, I had to know what I was doing. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1970.96s)]
*  She spends months, even years, preparing for roles, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1973.96s)]
*  inventing an elaborate backstory for every character, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1976.96s)]
*  down to what sport they played in school [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1980.96s)]
*  and how they feel about their mothers. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1982.96s)]
*  You know me, I'm impulsive. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1984.96s)]
*  She's learned to dig for fossils, make dresses [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1986.96s)]
*  and free dive, holding her breath from the cold. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1989.96s)]
*  She's been holding her breath for more than [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1993.0s)]
*  seven minutes for Avatar 2. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1995.0s)]
*  And she's not afraid of being exposed. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=1999.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2002.0s)]
*  Make me invisible. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2003.0s)]
*  Because to see a Kate Winslet movie often means [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2005.0s)]
*  you'll see a lot of Kate Winslet. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2008.0s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2011.0s)]
*  And then there's the accents. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2013.0s)]
*  Yeah, Mayor Shan, down at Easttown. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2016.0s)]
*  She won an Emmy for Mayor of Easttown, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2018.0s)]
*  and she's playing a vaping, beer-swinging detective [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2021.04s)]
*  nailing the specific sound of Delaware County, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2024.04s)]
*  a Philadelphia suburb. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2027.04s)]
*  She's probably lying at the bottom [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2029.04s)]
*  of the Delaware River right now. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2031.04s)]
*  And why is it Philly so hard? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2033.04s)]
*  It's actually the I sound in the Philadelphia [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2035.04s)]
*  and the Delco dialect that is really difficult. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2038.04s)]
*  They don't say, that's nice. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2041.04s)]
*  They say, that's nice. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2043.04s)]
*  I like your bike. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2045.04s)]
*  And though she may seem like someone [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2047.04s)]
*  who's been at the shelf full of Oscars, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2049.08s)]
*  she won her first and only in 2009 [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2051.08s)]
*  for her portrayal of a Nazi prison guard in The Reader. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2054.08s)]
*  I want to take out a book. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2058.08s)]
*  For years, she kept the statue in her bathroom [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2060.08s)]
*  so guests could hold it up in the mirror [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2063.08s)]
*  and pretend to win. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2065.08s)]
*  I used to get the bus into town a lot. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2067.08s)]
*  We went with Winslet to Reading, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2069.08s)]
*  the working-class town just outside London [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2071.08s)]
*  where she was born and raised. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2074.08s)]
*  This is the house? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2076.08s)]
*  Oh, my God, this is the house. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2077.08s)]
*  The front door boarded up. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2078.12s)]
*  Her family no longer lives here. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2080.12s)]
*  I lived here until when I was sort of 16 [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2082.12s)]
*  and I kind of left home really when I was 16. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2085.12s)]
*  Winslet is the second of four children. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2088.12s)]
*  Her father was a struggling actor [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2091.12s)]
*  who often gave his daughter the advice she still lives by. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2093.12s)]
*  You're only as good as your last gig. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2096.12s)]
*  He would sort of hop from job to job [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2099.12s)]
*  and then he would do, you know, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2101.12s)]
*  part-time work to make ends meet in the meantime. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2102.12s)]
*  But the thing that was interesting, I think, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2105.12s)]
*  is that even though there was so little, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2107.16s)]
*  as you can see, to go around, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2110.16s)]
*  we were really happy. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2112.16s)]
*  With financial help from a charity for actors, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2114.16s)]
*  she enrolled in a local theatre school when she was 11, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2117.16s)]
*  catching the train into London for auditions. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2120.16s)]
*  She says the scrutiny of her appearance started young. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2123.16s)]
*  You once had a drama teacher tell you [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2127.16s)]
*  settle for the fat girl parts? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2129.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2132.16s)]
*  Now, listen, Kate, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2133.16s)]
*  I'm telling you, darling, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2135.2s)]
*  if you're going to look like this, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2137.2s)]
*  you'll have to settle for the fat girl parts. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2139.2s)]
*  And I was never even fat. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2141.2s)]
*  What did that do to your spirit? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2143.2s)]
*  Your confidence? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2145.2s)]
*  It made me think, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2146.2s)]
*  I'll just show you, just quietly. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2147.2s)]
*  It was like a sort of a quiet determination, really. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2150.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'll just go in. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2154.2s)]
*  This grocery store was once the deli [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2155.2s)]
*  where 16-year-old Winslet was working [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2158.2s)]
*  when she got the news that she'd landed her first movie. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2160.2s)]
*  And I was making a sandwich, and the phone rang, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2163.24s)]
*  and I swear to God, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2166.24s)]
*  there was something about the way the phone rang. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2167.24s)]
*  You knew? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2169.24s)]
*  I was like, oh, my God, that's for me. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2170.24s)]
*  I wonder if it's about the job. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2172.24s)]
*  And then the owner was like, hey, phone for you. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2173.24s)]
*  I thought, oh, my God. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2176.24s)]
*  So I ran and was told that I'd gotten this part. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2177.24s)]
*  And then I was just so unraveled, I had to leave. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2182.24s)]
*  I was like, oh, I have to go home and tell Mom and Dad. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2185.24s)]
*  After filming that first movie, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2188.24s)]
*  Winslet went right back to making sandwiches. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2190.2s)]
*  That must have been kind of what is going on in my world. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2194.2s)]
*  Oh, no, because that was what I knew. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2197.2s)]
*  My dad would do jobs, and he'd go back to tar-macking the roads [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2199.2s)]
*  or working as a postman. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2203.2s)]
*  So I just thought, oh, well, that's what you do as an actor. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2205.2s)]
*  If you're lucky, you get a job, and then you go back to a day job. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2207.2s)]
*  At 20, she got the offer for the part [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2210.2s)]
*  that would make Hollywood history. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2213.2s)]
*  Playing Rose opposite Leonardo DiCaprio is Jack in Titanic, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2217.2s)]
*  the first film to break a billion dollars at the box office. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2222.2s)]
*  Winslet was game to discuss just about anything, but... [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2226.2s)]
*  Let's talk about Titanic. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2231.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2233.2s)]
*  I was wondering what your reaction would be if I said that to you. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2234.2s)]
*  No, I'm happy to talk about Titanic. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2238.2s)]
*  I guess it wouldn't be an interview with you [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2240.2s)]
*  if we didn't talk about Titanic in some way. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2242.2s)]
*  It could be an interview without it. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2244.2s)]
*  We tried to ask about the famous scene [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2246.2s)]
*  that has sparked decades of debates. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2248.2s)]
*  I'll never let go. I promise. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2250.2s)]
*  May I ask, true, Leo really could have fit on the raft? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2254.2s)]
*  Do you know what? I have no idea. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2260.2s)]
*  Does it annoy you at all that 27 years later, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2264.2s)]
*  this movie still comes up in this way [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2267.2s)]
*  and probably will for the rest of your life? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2269.2s)]
*  No. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2272.2s)]
*  I tell you, what I do sometimes find just curious, I suppose, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2273.2s)]
*  is whatever I say about Titanic will often be the take-home. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2279.2s)]
*  So I just think, well, there were those things that I said [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2283.2s)]
*  about the film I was talking about, and yet that's the one thing. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2286.2s)]
*  So that's the only thing that sometimes I just think, hmm. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2289.2s)]
*  What to miss? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2294.2s)]
*  To the stars. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2297.2s)]
*  While Titanic made Winslet a star, she says it came at a cost. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2299.2s)]
*  Paparazzi aggressively pursued her [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2304.2s)]
*  and just listened to how she was ridiculed for her weight. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2307.2s)]
*  There's cake a little melted and poured into that dress, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2311.2s)]
*  and you know, she just needed two sizes large [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2313.2s)]
*  and it would probably have been okay. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2315.2s)]
*  I gasped at how cruel some of that coverage was of you at that time. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2317.2s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2322.2s)]
*  It's absolutely appalling. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2324.2s)]
*  What kind of a person must they be to do something like that [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2326.2s)]
*  to a young actress who's just trying to figure it out? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2330.2s)]
*  Did you ever get face-to-face with any of those people? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2335.2s)]
*  I did get face-to-face. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2338.2s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2340.2s)]
*  I let them have it. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2341.2s)]
*  I said, I hope this haunts you. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2342.2s)]
*  It was a great moment. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2344.2s)]
*  It was a great moment because it wasn't just for me. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2351.2s)]
*  It was for all those people who were subjected to that level of harassment. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2356.2s)]
*  It was horrific. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2360.2s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2362.2s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2364.2s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2366.2s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2368.2s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2370.2s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2372.2s)]
*  When you cooked it, it didn't taste good. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2374.2s)]
*  It was터 horrific. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2376.2s)]
*  It was really bad. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2378.2s)]
*  Now 48, Winslet says she developed an armor that she brings to characters [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2380.2s)]
*  like Lee Miller. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2385.2s)]
*  People say, Oh, you were so brave for this role. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2387.2s)]
*  You didn't wear any makeup. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2390.2s)]
*  You know, you had wrinkles. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2392.2s)]
*  Do we say to them, Oh, you were so brave for this role? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2393.2s)]
*  You grew a beard? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2395.2s)]
*  No, we don't. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2397.2s)]
*  Still hapen tmay you? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2399.2s)]
*  It's playing the part. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2400.2s)]
*  Is it true that a crew member came up to you and said, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2402.2s)]
*  you might want to kind of sit up a little bit, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2406.2s)]
*  you're showing a lump? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2408.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2410.2s)]
*  You might want to kind of just sit in, suck in, sit up. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2411.2s)]
*  And I was like... [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2415.2s)]
*  You didn't. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2417.2s)]
*  I don't think Lee would have done. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2418.2s)]
*  It's about knowing that Lee's, her ease with her physical self [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2420.2s)]
*  was hard won. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2425.2s)]
*  In Hollywood, you could have a lot of great lights [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2426.2s)]
*  so that you don't see the lump that we all have, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2429.2s)]
*  the bumps that we all have. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2431.2s)]
*  You don't care about showing that. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2433.2s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2435.2s)]
*  Why not? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2436.2s)]
*  It's exhausting. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2438.2s)]
*  When she's not filming, Winslet lives far from the spotlight [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2440.2s)]
*  in a quiet English seaside village. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2443.2s)]
*  She and her husband, Ned Abel Smith, have a 10-year-old son. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2446.2s)]
*  She also has a 20-year-old son and 24-year-old daughter [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2450.2s)]
*  from previous marriages. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2453.2s)]
*  Winslet is not on social media [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2455.2s)]
*  and told us she doesn't read reviews of her work, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2458.2s)]
*  but this much she knows. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2461.2s)]
*  It's hard to make films about historical female figures. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2463.2s)]
*  Typically, those aren't films that would necessarily do well [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2467.2s)]
*  in the box office. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2470.2s)]

*  And we made a film about one woman. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2476.2s)]
*  So there's not a sense of, I told you so? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2478.2s)]
*  No, I don't feel like that, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2481.2s)]

*  led by a former army captain, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2541.2s)]
*  attempted a comparable scheme in Afghanistan, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2543.2s)]
*  this one involving nearly 400 people [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2545.2s)]
*  and no formal U.S. government support. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2547.2s)]
*  And the overarching plan, initially, is what? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2551.2s)]
*  Well, the overarching plan initially is, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2555.2s)]
*  what the hell are we doing? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2557.2s)]

*  Afghans fleeing the conquering Taliban in August 2021. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2623.2s)]
*  So desperate to get out, they overwhelmed the Kabul airport, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2628.2s)]
*  and clung to departing U.S. military planes, a last grasp at freedom. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2632.2s)]
*  Did it feel like defeat? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2639.2s)]
*  I mean, it felt like defeat because, technically, it was a defeat. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2641.2s)]
*  But it felt much more like leaving people behind personally. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2644.2s)]
*  Jason Kander had served as an Army intelligence officer in Afghanistan, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2649.2s)]
*  meeting thugs, he says, to glean information about other thugs, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2654.2s)]
*  often accompanied only by his translator, Salam Raufi. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2658.2s)]
*  To know that there were people there who had put their lives on the line for us, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2662.2s)]
*  it felt like leaving a friend behind when you had promised them you wouldn't. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2667.2s)]
*  Home in Kansas City, Kander watched in shock as Afghanistan fell, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2672.2s)]
*  and immediately he reached out to his translator, Salam, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2677.2s)]
*  who was safe and out of the country. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2680.2s)]
*  And at some point I did say to him, you know, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2683.2s)]
*  do you have anybody over there who's in danger? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2685.2s)]
*  And he told me about his nephew in Afghanistan. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2688.2s)]
*  Salam's nephew, Rahim, was squarely in Taliban crosshairs [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2691.2s)]
*  because he possessed critical documents from his work in payroll [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2694.2s)]
*  for Afghanistan International Bank. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2698.2s)]
*  What list does Rahim have that makes him such a target? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2700.2s)]
*  Rahim has access to the list of tens of thousands of Afghans [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2704.2s)]
*  who had worked directly with everybody from the U.N. to the U.S. Embassy [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2708.2s)]
*  to any other multilateral just trying to build democracy in Afghanistan. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2712.2s)]
*  Everything that the Taliban stood against [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2717.2s)]
*  and everything that once the Taliban took over, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2719.2s)]
*  one of their first priorities was to find those people [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2721.2s)]
*  and make an example of them by imprisoning them or killing them. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2724.2s)]
*  Does the Taliban ever get their hands on that list? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2727.2s)]
*  No, I never gave it. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2729.2s)]
*  Never got the list? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2732.2s)]
*  Never provide a single information. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2733.2s)]
*  Rahim Raufi's refusal to cooperate enraged the Taliban. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2736.2s)]
*  How were you threatened? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2740.2s)]
*  We just received night letters. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2742.2s)]
*  Night letters? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2745.2s)]
*  Yeah, night letters. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2746.2s)]
*  The night letters were Taliban edicts dropped under doors under the shroud of dark. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2747.2s)]
*  One sent to the Raufi home in Kabul read, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2754.2s)]
*  Your whole family is sentenced to death for betraying the Islamic Emirate, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2757.2s)]
*  using the Taliban's choice term for Afghanistan. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2762.2s)]
*  They clearly mentioned that they are going to kill me. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2765.2s)]
*  You had to get out of there? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2768.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2769.2s)]
*  For Rahim and his clan of 12, his wife, their children, including triplets, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2770.2s)]
*  his mom, his brothers, a nephew, sisters-in-law, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2775.2s)]
*  hope for a passage to safety rested with a little league dad [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2778.2s)]
*  nine and a half time zones away in Kansas City, Missouri, Jason Kander. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2782.2s)]
*  The two began exchanging encrypted text messages. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2786.2s)]
*  He was the only one, the only person who showed up for you that in your worst time. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2790.2s)]
*  But you've never seen this guy? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2796.2s)]
*  Even I don't know how he looks like. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2798.2s)]
*  My thinking was how in the world can I go on with the rest of my life [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2800.2s)]
*  thinking maybe there was something else I could have done for Rahim. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2805.2s)]
*  Yet another dynamic. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2809.2s)]
*  After Kander had been honorably discharged as an army captain, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2811.2s)]
*  a political career took off. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2814.2s)]
*  He was seen as a rising Democratic Party star, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2816.2s)]
*  and in 2016, Kander nearly won a U.S. Senate seat for Missouri. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2819.2s)]
*  Then he stepped away from politics, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2823.2s)]
*  citing his struggles with uncreated PTSD, an unhappy legacy from Afghanistan. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2825.2s)]
*  And this didn't give you pause, maybe I shouldn't jump back in the fire. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2831.2s)]
*  The very country where this PTSD took root, no less. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2836.2s)]
*  Ultimately, I just made the decision that it didn't matter. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2840.2s)]
*  I would deal with it afterwards. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2843.2s)]
*  And I made the decision, which I knew at the time was probably poor judgment, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2845.2s)]
*  to say to Rahim, no matter how long it takes, we're going to get this done. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2850.2s)]
*  I knew that I was biting off more than I could chew. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2855.2s)]
*  And we're just trying to get our friends out of Afghanistan. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2858.2s)]
*  Kander joined with other private citizens, feverishly plotting to evacuate [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2861.2s)]
*  nearly 400 endangered Afghans that included soldiers, poets, doctors, and the Raufis. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2865.2s)]
*  And the overarching plan initially is what? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2872.2s)]
*  Well, the overarching plan initially is, what the hell are we doing? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2876.2s)]
*  That didn't work, let's try this. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2880.2s)]
*  Jason's wife Diana became concerned her husband's desire to rescue the Raufi family [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2882.2s)]
*  might damage his own family. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2887.2s)]
*  Are you worried he may decide to go over there? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2889.2s)]
*  Yeah, he asked me for his, he called me from the other room, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2892.2s)]
*  he's like, hey, where's my passport, just by the by. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2897.2s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, zero chance. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2900.2s)]
*  You're even getting access to your passport. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2902.2s)]
*  You brought it up? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2904.2s)]
*  Oh, even me and some other guys. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2905.2s)]
*  We had ideas, they were all bad ideas, but we were also running out of ideas by that point. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2907.2s)]
*  Once the last American military plane departed Afghanistan on August 30, 2021, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2915.2s)]
*  the Taliban controlled the Kabul airport, choking off the most obvious escape route. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2921.2s)]
*  Kander and his ad hoc group directed the imperiled Afghans to head to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2927.2s)]
*  Let's get everybody to Mazar-e-Sharif, let's have them in hiding, and then let's charter a plane, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2934.2s)]
*  get it in there, and then we've got to figure out somehow how to take all these people who the Taliban are looking for [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2941.2s)]
*  and stage them in one place and get them into the airport. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2948.2s)]
*  The thinking at that moment? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2952.2s)]
*  In the north of the country, the Taliban wasn't quite as entrenched. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2953.2s)]
*  But for the Raufi family, the city of Mazar-e-Sharif was a treacherous 11-hour drive from Kabul, dotted with Taliban checkpoints. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2957.2s)]
*  Is there not a fear that you are potentially sending this family of 12 to their death? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2965.2s)]
*  Yeah, it was a big fear. It was all I thought about. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2971.2s)]
*  How do you reckon with that? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2975.2s)]
*  I wasn't going to walk away, and it also seemed like if we weren't successful, that's what was going to happen anyway. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2976.2s)]
*  Part of it was Rahim had to send me all the documents for the entire family. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2986.2s)]
*  That included headshots of all 12 Raufis. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2990.2s)]
*  So at this point, what's living in my phone is pictures of these little girls. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2994.2s)]
*  And for me, what I kept thinking about was, my wife came here as a refugee at the age of eight from Ukraine with her family. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=2999.2s)]
*  And when I looked at these little girls, that's what I saw. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3008.2s)]
*  I saw little Diana. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3016.2s)]
*  And so not only was quitting not an option, failure wasn't an option. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3019.2s)]
*  In the early morning of September 1st, 2021, the Raufis began their convoy to Mazar. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3026.2s)]
*  A few minutes in... [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3031.2s)]
*  Suddenly the Taliban came out in front of my car and they had a gun in their hands. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3033.2s)]
*  Oh my God. I said, now you are done. They start searching us. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3041.2s)]
*  Taliban searching your car? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3047.2s)]
*  Yeah, Taliban search me and the driver. And they have the gun and the kids are just... [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3049.2s)]
*  They thought that they are going to shoot me or the driver. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3054.2s)]
*  Only because of my kids crying and shouting, they just released. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3058.2s)]
*  If your children are not crying in the car, which gets sympathy from the Taliban, done. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3064.2s)]
*  Done. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3069.2s)]
*  They finally rolled into Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan's fourth largest city. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3070.2s)]
*  And now what? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3076.2s)]
*  The Raufis are in Mazar-e-Sharif and myself and the people I was now working with are engaged in solving a few problems, or trying to. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3079.2s)]
*  One, how do we raise the money to get an airplane chartered to fly in there to pick up close to 400 people? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3085.2s)]
*  And also, how do we make it so that the Taliban doesn't know that we are doing this? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3091.2s)]
*  The day after the Raufis arrived in Mazar in September 2021, the Taliban, in a show of strength, paraded in the center of town. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3098.2s)]
*  The Raufis went underground for weeks, finding their own safe houses. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3106.2s)]
*  One night, Rahim surreptitiously took this video of a Taliban roundup, just across the street from where the family was hiding. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3111.2s)]
*  As the Raufis dodged the Taliban, half a world away, Jason Kander and his co-conspirators were finalizing a Hail Mary plan of either genius or insanity. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3119.2s)]
*  On September 21st, it was go time. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3129.2s)]
*  Can you tell Rahim, okay, today's the day, you're moving? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3133.2s)]
*  Get ready, bring a bag, code word Bella. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3149.2s)]
*  Is it someone that I should give this code? Whom I should give? Because Jason didn't give me a name that you should go to that person. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3152.2s)]
*  He just told me to go to this location. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3159.2s)]
*  So you have a code, but you don't know who to say. You say the code to the wrong person. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3162.2s)]
*  If you say the code to the wrong person, then you're... [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3167.2s)]
*  Kander directed the Raufis to a wedding palace in Mazar. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3170.2s)]
*  There, Rahim spotted a man with a beard, a turban, and a look of authority. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3174.2s)]
*  He had a laptop. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3179.2s)]
*  That was your clue. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3181.2s)]
*  The Raufis were led to a large hall inside the wedding palace. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3203.2s)]
*  You see that there are more people. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3211.2s)]
*  There are women, men, kids with their back. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3214.2s)]
*  Just like you, hundreds and hundreds of people. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3219.2s)]
*  Yes, 370 or 380 people. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3221.2s)]
*  Do you recognize any of them? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3226.2s)]
*  None of them. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3227.2s)]
*  You didn't know any of them? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3228.2s)]
*  No one is talking with each other, just, hi, hello, salam. That's it. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3229.2s)]
*  Then I called Jason and said, brother, I'm in, but there are more people. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3234.2s)]
*  Then he told me, welcome to the wedding party. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3241.2s)]
*  Welcome to the wedding party. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3245.2s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3247.2s)]
*  Yeah. Welcome to the wedding. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3248.2s)]
*  Is there a bride? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3250.2s)]
*  No. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3251.2s)]
*  A groom? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3252.2s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3253.2s)]
*  Music? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3254.2s)]
*  Nothing at all. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3255.2s)]
*  I hope they fed you at least. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3256.2s)]
*  Very good. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3257.2s)]
*  It was a fake wedding, a ruse to slip past the unsuspecting Taliban and gather 383 Afghans in one place before a high stakes attempt to reach the airport. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3259.2s)]
*  When we come back, the wedding party makes its great escape. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3269.2s)]
*  The fake wedding threw the Taliban off the scent, but 383 Afghans with ties to the U.S. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3273.2s)]
*  and the fight for democracy were marooned for three days in a wedding hall. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3290.2s)]
*  All the while, Jason Kander, the former army captain in Kansas City, continued concocting the evacuation plan. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3294.2s)]
*  Through crowdfunding and private donations, Kander and other orchestrators frantically raised money to charter a commercial plane that would whisk away the entire wedding party to, of all places, Albania, a way station until the Afghans were granted clearance to enter the U.S. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3301.2s)]
*  But inside the wedding palace, Rahim Raoufi knew none of this. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3318.2s)]
*  It was not clear for me what Jason is doing. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3322.2s)]
*  It's a lot of trust. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3326.2s)]
*  It's just trust. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3327.2s)]
*  When did you start to realize that things might be moving in a good direction? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3329.2s)]
*  Some people start receiving travel documents, like the boarding pass. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3334.2s)]
*  How did you get your boarding pass? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3341.2s)]
*  Yeah, we just received it through email. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3343.2s)]
*  This is the one. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3346.2s)]
*  That? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3348.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3349.2s)]
*  That's your boarding pass? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3350.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's a boarding pass with my entire family names on it. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3351.2s)]
*  It says special flight. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3357.2s)]
*  This doesn't look particularly official. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3360.2s)]
*  This looks like an email from a law firm with some yearbook photos photoshopped. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3365.2s)]
*  That's what the 380 people, they had only this one. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3371.2s)]
*  This too was the handiwork of the rescue team in America in coordination with Jason Kander. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3377.2s)]
*  Explain these boarding passes, which look something less than official. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3383.2s)]
*  So the boarding passes, which were quite unofficial, only matter if there is a flight manifest document from the nation of Albania. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3388.2s)]
*  Otherwise, they're just a piece of paper you're going to present and then go to prison. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3397.2s)]
*  So what was going to happen was the Albanian government was going to send to the Taliban a visa cleared flight manifest, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3401.2s)]
*  a list of people that said these are the people who we are expecting to have land in our country. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3408.2s)]
*  Now, what these people needed to do was present something that had their pictures on it, had their names, their date of birth, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3414.2s)]
*  everything that would match up to what was on that document. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3420.2s)]
*  In other words, everything rested on the Taliban, a group more known for executions than for following international protocol. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3423.2s)]
*  The really terrifying and lethal game of capture the flag that was trying to get someone out of Afghanistan at that moment in time worked like this. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3431.2s)]
*  If the Taliban finds you and you're someone they're looking for, they can do whatever they want, they run the country. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3441.2s)]
*  If they do not find you until you have made it inside the airport and you are on a manifest for a flight that is visa cleared by another country, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3446.2s)]
*  well now, if they imprison you or shoot you in the head, you are someone that was expected to land in another country and now it's an international incident. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3456.2s)]
*  It was finally time to test the Taliban. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3464.2s)]
*  Buses arrived at the Masuri Sharif airport filled with the 383 members of the wedding party. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3467.2s)]
*  Oh my God, there was checkpoints. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3474.2s)]
*  In the terminal and on the tarmac, the Taliban was everywhere. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3477.2s)]
*  They were just coming and see to your face. I was shaking, I was sweating. Now what? Now you're in front of the Taliban. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3481.2s)]
*  They were just looking for a single mistake. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3493.2s)]
*  One little number, one misspelled name. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3496.2s)]
*  One misspelled number, misspelled name or anything to stop you. If they stop you, then you're gone. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3499.2s)]
*  From the gate, the Raufis could see their aircraft, this vessel to freedom, so tantalizingly close. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3505.2s)]
*  Are you thinking this is the big gamble? This is either going to end terribly or I'm getting on that plane. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3512.2s)]
*  It's a gambling that you even didn't see your cards. What do you have? What do you got? What will happen? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3518.2s)]
*  You just gambled your entire life. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3527.2s)]
*  The bet paid off. Astonishingly, the Taliban honored the homemade boarding passes in the Albanian manifest and relented. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3530.2s)]
*  The wedding party boarded the charter plane. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3538.2s)]
*  Back in Kansas City, Jason Kander followed the drama on a flight tracking app. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3541.2s)]
*  There's zero planes over Afghanistan. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3546.2s)]
*  And then finally they're on the plane and the transponder turns on and you see one little airplane turn on on the runway in Masri Sharif. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3549.2s)]
*  That's your plane. That was Bella. That was our plane. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3559.2s)]
*  After the plane soared safely out of Afghan airspace, the champagne came out. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3562.2s)]
*  The rescuers celebrated. The wedding party landed in Tirana, Albania and were bussed to a seaside resort, the Raffaello. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3567.2s)]
*  By sheer coincidence, a giant replica of the Statue of Liberty stands outside the front lobby. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3577.2s)]
*  That was a very beautiful hotel, one of the topest hotels near the ocean with the ocean view. So when we arrived there, I said, wow. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3582.2s)]
*  Rahim Raufi recorded this video of his kids on the beach addressing a guy they still hadn't met. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3593.2s)]
*  Thank you, Jason Uncle. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3599.2s)]
*  Thank you, Jason Uncle. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3601.2s)]
*  They get to Albania, obviously not the ultimate final destination. How long did you anticipate everyone being in Albania for? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3603.2s)]
*  So what we had been told by people at the Department of Homeland Security was that it would probably be a few weeks. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3611.2s)]
*  And what happened is that weeks went by and then somewhere I want to say two, three months after we got out, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3620.2s)]
*  the State Department made an announcement that anybody who got out after August 31st would not be part of Operation Allies Welcome. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3626.2s)]
*  And basically it was all code for you're on your own. If you got out this way, that's a private effort. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3636.2s)]
*  We got nothing to do with it. And that was a big shock and a huge problem. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3642.2s)]
*  A year passed. By the fall of 2022, the honeymoon long over, the wedding party was still stuck at the Rafaello Resort in Albania. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3647.2s)]
*  Maybe we are not going to be accepted. Then they will send us back. So if they send us back, I'm sure on the airport they will kill us. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3656.2s)]
*  On top of that, private donations that had been covering the resort tab were running low. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3666.2s)]
*  You've crossed the year mark. Who's paying this hotel bill? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3671.2s)]
*  There were some very generous donors who helped us over time. And the people who had helped me raise the money in the first place did a lot of work. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3675.2s)]
*  And it's taken a toll on all of us. But I think now, if you talk to any of us, we'd say it's the most important thing we've ever done. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3682.2s)]
*  Finally, nearly two years into the wedding party saga, emails arrived from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3691.2s)]
*  The Afghans had been approved officially to resettle in America. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3698.2s)]
*  Oh my God, that was a big party. I just called Jason and said, hey, we all got the approval. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3702.2s)]
*  Emotional day. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3709.2s)]
*  I was like crying inside. Yep. Now you have a future. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3711.2s)]
*  Rahim Raufi had never been to America, but he knew exactly where he wanted to call home. As he put it to Jason Kander... [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3721.2s)]
*  Where do you live? Because I have no idea. But wherever you live, I'll come to that state. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3729.2s)]
*  In June of 2023, Rahim Raufi and his family arrived in Kansas City. Jason Kander and his family were there to greet them. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3737.2s)]
*  I said, brother, is this real life? He said, Jason replied me, yes. And I said, we did it. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3746.2s)]
*  You've had this intense multi-year relationship with this family, but you've never met them. When you finally see them in person, what is that like for you? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3755.2s)]
*  It was sort of an out-of-body experience. And to see my kids and the Raufi kids sitting on the floor playing and not needing any language... [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3762.2s)]
*  It really underlined for me what I had felt all along, which is that there's really no difference between these kids and my kids. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3772.2s)]
*  And that they all deserve the same thing. And yeah, it was pretty special. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3779.2s)]
*  Today, Rahim Raufi is back to working in accounts at a bank, this one in downtown Kansas City, where his brothers serve as security guards. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3784.2s)]
*  The Raufis and the Kanders regularly get together for a traditional Afghan meal, Bella of codeword fame included. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3793.2s)]
*  For all the distance that once divided them, they now live 10 minutes apart. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3801.2s)]
*  At midnight, when I wake up, I'm taking like one or two minutes to think, is it real? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3807.2s)]
*  Still. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3816.2s)]
*  Still. Is it real? I'm going to my kids' room and see them and check them. They are sleeping very comfortably. And the next day they are going to school. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3817.2s)]
*  Afghanistan doesn't go down as a great U.S. military success. Do you feel like you got a W here? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3831.2s)]
*  There was a point during this where somebody I was doing this with and we were talking and one of us said, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3840.2s)]
*  do you worry that maybe all we're trying to do is win the war we just lost? And yeah, I think there was a part of that for sure. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3847.2s)]
*  But I want Americans to know that every Afghan that they meet did something heroic to get here. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3852.2s)]
*  And when you first meet them, they might be in a job where you may not think about that. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3860.2s)]
*  They might be busing your table. They might be driving your Uber. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3865.2s)]
*  But these are some of the most industrious and resilient and incredible people that you'll ever meet. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3868.2s)]
*  And I just would like every American to know that. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3874.2s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3882.2s)]
*  I think I asked direct questions. I don't know that they're tough questions per se. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3892.2s)]
*  What price should Moscow pay for trying to manipulate American voters? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3896.2s)]
*  Isn't that giving people false hope? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3900.2s)]
*  That's the role of Face the Nation to focus on the issues at hand. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYmbHv2nWw&t=3902.2s)]
