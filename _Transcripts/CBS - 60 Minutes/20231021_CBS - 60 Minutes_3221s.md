# Reports from some of the world's most interesting places | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ)
*  The sea ice over the Arctic is melting and shrinking so fast, we will see in our lifetime [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=0.0s)]
*  something that hasn't happened, it's believed, since the end of the last ice age. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=19.54s)]
*  The opening of an ocean. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=24.76s)]
*  The Arctic Ocean. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=26.54s)]
*  And with that, access to trade routes and trillions of dollars worth of oil and natural [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=28.32s)]
*  gas, almost as much as the entire U.S. economy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=33.04s)]
*  But this isn't a story about climate change. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=38.04s)]
*  This is a story about the competition for those riches. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=40.84s)]
*  The Russians, for instance, have already amassed a major military presence in the region. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=44.5s)]
*  It's also about pioneers, U.S. scientists and naval personnel, learning to tough it [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=50.64s)]
*  the harshness of this still ice-covered frontier. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=57.720000000000006s)]
*  We discovered just how harsh on a recent trip to the Arctic. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=61.72s)]
*  The Arctic Ocean sits on top of the globe, encircled by Russia, which encompasses about [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  half of its coastline, Norway, Greenland, Canada, and the United States, thanks to Alaska. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=73.0s)]
*  We flew, as guests of the Navy, from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, 200 miles in the direction of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=82.8s)]
*  the North Pole, over fractured, thinning ice, to a spot where the ice was still thick enough [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=88.52s)]
*  to support this base camp. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=94.52s)]
*  It was a small, temporary village, disrupting the peace and purity of the ice, white as [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=97.2s)]
*  far as the eye can see. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=103.24s)]
*  The camp was built for a scientific and military exercise called ICEX 2016. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=106.16s)]
*  For five weeks, this no-man's land of ice was home to an expeditionary team of sailors, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=117.96s)]
*  scientists and engineers, whose mission was to understand how to survive in maybe the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=125.12s)]
*  most hostile conditions on Earth. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=129.98s)]
*  The Navy says those taking part in this exercise are the first humans ever to set foot on this [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=133.32s)]
*  part of the planet. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=139.04s)]
*  It's actually beautiful beyond belief, isn't it? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=140.32s)]
*  It really is. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  Chuck Maguire was one of the first to arrive. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  He's an engineer with the University of Washington's Applied Physics Lab that was brought in to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=147.68s)]
*  build this camp from scratch. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=153.32s)]
*  So you get off the plane, there's nothing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=156.22s)]
*  There's no shelter, there's no indoors. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=160.76s)]
*  There was just ice. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=161.76s)]
*  Ice everywhere. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=162.88s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=163.88s)]
*  And you say, how am I going to survive? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=164.88s)]
*  You pick up a hammer and start building. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=166.76s)]
*  They built a makeshift city called Sargo for roughly 60 people, consisting of a command [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=169.6s)]
*  post, tight living quarters, a mess hall stocked with food airlifted in weekly, and some very [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=175.56s)]
*  primitive toilet facilities. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=182.96s)]
*  That outhouse is really cold. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  Outhouse is awful. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=188.32s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=189.32s)]
*  What about water? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=190.32s)]
*  Dehydration. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=191.32s)]
*  You can't see ice, right? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=192.32s)]
*  You can if you know what you're looking for. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=193.32s)]
*  This ice mining team knows what to look for, old sea ice that's been baking in the sun [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=197.0s)]
*  long enough that the salt has leached out. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=203.32s)]
*  Ice mining team, ice mining team, we are returning back to camp. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  They bring back chunks to melt down into the camp's only drinking water. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=211.4s)]
*  All the things that you take for granted in normal civilization, right, shelter, food, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=217.08s)]
*  the ease of going to the bathroom, right, that is all different out here. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=223.12s)]
*  What qualities do you think it takes to stay here and survive out here for weeks? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=227.96s)]
*  I think maybe you have to be a little off initially and really understand that everything [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  outside that door is trying to kill you here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  If the ice and wind don't get you, polar bears might. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=245.38s)]
*  An armed sentry patrols the perimeter of the camp in case one comes looking for food. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=249.26s)]
*  Good evening everyone. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  Another successful day here at Sargo. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  There's a daily briefing in the command post to coordinate the various researchers who [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=258.26s)]
*  are studying and trying to understand this part of the world as they plan for a more [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=262.84s)]
*  sustained presence here. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=268.12s)]
*  They're analyzing among other things. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=270.7s)]
*  The ice floe has moved about nine miles to the west-northwest today. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=272.62s)]
*  How climate change is affecting the way the ice here drifts and migrates. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=276.18s)]
*  It feels like you're on land. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=281.54s)]
*  You get the sense that you're on land. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=283.86s)]
*  It's very firm and the plane could land. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=285.44s)]
*  But we're moving, which is kind of astonishing. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=289.1s)]
*  I think every day it's interesting to wake up and recognize your eight or nine miles [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=291.5s)]
*  from where you were the day before. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=296.38s)]
*  It's the same, but it's pretty interesting to figure that out. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=298.3s)]
*  The ice moves that much every day in unpredictable directions because of the currents underwater [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=302.6s)]
*  and the wind above. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=309.34000000000003s)]
*  Down here we're 23 degrees Celsius. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=311.58000000000004s)]
*  Also unpredictable is the weather. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=315.42s)]
*  We met a team of meteorologists using balloons to help with forecasting, which is key for [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=317.66s)]
*  any military operation. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  So these balloons measure your temperature, your dew point, the wind speed. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=326.02000000000004s)]
*  Commander Scott Parker, a meteorologist with the Navy's Atlantic Submarine Force, says [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=330.62s)]
*  there's virtually no weather data collected up here. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=335.58000000000004s)]
*  In other parts of the world, meteorologists rely on satellites for forecasting. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=339.0s)]
*  But up here near the North Pole, satellite coverage is minimal. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  How cold does it get up here? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=349.18s)]
*  Because it's right now, I don't know. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=350.56s)]
*  It's freezing, right? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=352.18s)]
*  People can see. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=353.18s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=354.18s)]
*  The temperature we've had is 26 below Fahrenheit, and today is actually our warmest day. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=355.34000000000003s)]
*  Come on. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=360.18s)]
*  And right now it's 6 below. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=361.18s)]
*  And with this wind chill factor, because the wind is really blowing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=362.3s)]
*  It is. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=365.18s)]
*  It is terrible. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=366.18s)]
*  It's about 25 below zero with the wind chill. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=367.18s)]
*  And you're telling me this is the warmest day you've had? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=369.1s)]
*  This is the warmest day we've had so far. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=371.18s)]
*  Do you want to go inside? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=373.46000000000004s)]
*  I do. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=374.46000000000004s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=375.46000000000004s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=376.46000000000004s)]
*  The temperature can drop to as low as 50 below, and that can wreak havoc on just about everything. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=377.46000000000004s)]
*  Weapons, communication systems, sensors, and people, including these Navy divers who were [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=383.46s)]
*  here to test their latest cold weather gear and their endurance in the frigid water. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=391.21999999999997s)]
*  These robotics engineers are conducting underwater experiments in a temperature-controlled tent. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=398.06s)]
*  When we were there, Doug Horner and his team were field testing these underwater drones [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=404.46s)]
*  for the first time in the Arctic. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=409.7s)]
*  When we first put it in, we checked the ballast. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=411.94s)]
*  The drones are collecting scientific data about the Arctic, where the water gets warmer [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=415.21999999999997s)]
*  the deeper you go. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=420.58s)]
*  They're also getting a picture of what it looks like down below. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=422.54s)]
*  My primary emphasis here is the ability to map the under ice. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=426.02s)]
*  So we have sensors, sonar specifically, which is sound, which is focused upwards. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=431.86s)]
*  And what we hope to do with continually putting sound upwards is to make a map. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=438.1s)]
*  You're mapping the bottom of the ice? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=444.26000000000005s)]
*  Yes, the underneath portion of the ice. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=446.62s)]
*  And why is that important? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=449.58000000000004s)]
*  I want to be able to navigate relative to that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=450.58000000000004s)]
*  So this is the idea of being able to navigate an underwater robot accurately without GPS, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  because in the ice you don't have the opportunity to come up to the surface for a GPS fix. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=459.66s)]
*  He says these drones could also be used to patrol the waters of the Arctic, looking for [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=464.20000000000005s)]
*  enemy subs, for instance, the way drones hover in the sky over a battlefield. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  The Navy is testing this technology and amassing all of this research to prepare for an expanded [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=475.44s)]
*  presence in the Arctic as the ice continues to melt. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=481.48s)]
*  The Russians are already there in force. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  Last year they staged a military exercise in the Arctic as seen in this Russian Ministry [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=489.12s)]

*  It involved about 40,000 troops, 15 submarines, 41 warships and multiple aircraft. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=496.36s)]
*  No one disputes their right to do that on their own territory. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=504.64s)]
*  It's just that it wasn't announced. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=508.44s)]
*  We pre-announce ours. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=511.06s)]
*  No one is surprised by them. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=512.64s)]
*  Whereas the exercise that Russia did was a snap exercise, which is a bit destabilizing. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=515.2800000000001s)]
*  Until May of this year, retired four-star general Philip Breedlove was the supreme allied [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=521.72s)]
*  commander of NATO with responsibility for the Arctic. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=527.6s)]
*  What else is destabilizing, he says, is Russia's military buildup along something called the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=532.24s)]
*  Northern Sea Route skirting the Russian Arctic coastline. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=537.96s)]
*  The route could become an alternative to the Suez Canal, saving huge amounts of time and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=542.36s)]
*  money for the commercial shipping industry. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=547.76s)]
*  I have heard as much as 28 days decrease in some of the transit from the Northern European [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=550.8399999999999s)]
*  markets to the Asian markets. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=557.0s)]
*  That is an incredible economic opportunity and it could be a very big boon to business [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=560.06s)]
*  around the world. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=565.9599999999999s)]
*  What would it mean if the Russians did gain control over the Northern Sea Route? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=567.0799999999999s)]
*  If the Russians had the ability to militarily hold that at ransom, that is a big lever over [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=571.1800000000001s)]
*  the world economy. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=578.9s)]
*  So tell us in a nutshell what's happening. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=580.1800000000001s)]
*  Along that route, what we see is Russia upgrading over 50 airfields and ports, 14 of them to [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=582.7s)]
*  be done this year, increasing the number of ground troops, putting in surface-to-air missiles, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=590.0600000000001s)]
*  putting in sensors that could be used to guide weapons, that could be used to deny [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=595.58s)]
*  access. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=601.5s)]
*  In 2007, Russia went so far as to plant its flag on the seafloor under the North Pole. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=602.5s)]
*  I think it's important to understand what the Deputy Prime Minister said, that the Arctic [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=610.14s)]
*  is a part of Russia, that they will provide the defense for the Arctic, and that they [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=616.26s)]
*  will make money in the Arctic, and that the Western world may therefore bring sanctions [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=624.14s)]
*  on them. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=630.78s)]
*  But that's okay, because tanks don't need visas. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=632.26s)]
*  I think it sends a pretty clear message. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=635.8199999999999s)]
*  The U.S. has not tried to match the Russian buildup, the Navy relying on its fleet of [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=638.34s)]
*  nuclear and attack submarines, the most powerful in the world. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=644.42s)]
*  When we were there, the Navy was conducting a submarine warfare exercise, something it [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=649.74s)]
*  does in the Arctic every two years. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=654.86s)]
*  When a sub surfaces in the Arctic, they use shovels to carve a visual landmark in the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=659.1s)]
*  ice that the sub can see. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=664.34s)]
*  X literally marks the spot. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=666.9s)]
*  But that X is a moving target because of the drifting ice, which makes maneuvering a windowless [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=669.88s)]
*  steel cylinder the size of a football field to such a pinpoint location seem impossible. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=677.3000000000001s)]
*  But on this day, the skipper and his crew, punching up through thick ice, nailed it [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=684.1s)]
*  on their first try. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=689.74s)]
*  It took a few minutes for the sail, the shark fin on top, to completely emerge. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=691.62s)]
*  When they popped the hatch, a special guest climbed out, the Secretary of the Navy, Ray [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=699.0600000000001s)]
*  Mabus, who'd been on board for five days, taking part in the naval exercise. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=704.14s)]
*  What does it mean that the Secretary of the Navy has come up to the Arctic? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=709.9s)]
*  Is there a special significance to you being here? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=714.06s)]
*  Our responsibilities are increasing as the Arctic ice melts, as the climate changes, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=717.14s)]
*  and so the Navy has got to be here. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=722.5s)]
*  We've got to provide that presence, and I hope that my presence emphasizes what we do. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=725.34s)]
*  As he flew off to Alaska, we climbed down the ladder into the fast-attack, nuclear-powered [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=731.24s)]
*  USS Hampton and went through a 100-degree change in temperature from 25 below to about [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=737.5600000000001s)]
*  75. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=744.76s)]
*  Do you feel claustrophobic? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=745.76s)]
*  Oh, no, not at all. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=747.76s)]
*  You get used to it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=750.0s)]
*  Commander of the Hampton, Theron Davis, took us to the control room as the crew prepared [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=751.48s)]
*  to submerge. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=756.48s)]
*  Very well. Stationary dive the ship. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=757.72s)]
*  Stationary dive the ship, I serve. Dive. Stationary dive the ship. Make your depth 150 feet. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=759.24s)]
*  What he and his crew of 20-somethings are practicing is something subs only do in the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=764.24s)]
*  Arctic, diving down through new ice that had formed around the sub. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=769.16s)]
*  What is that? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=778.4s)]
*  That's the ice breaking away. It's the first time we've surfaced through this thick ice [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=779.4s)]
*  in the state of Fittslaw, so that's the ice that's beside us. And as we go down, it's [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=781.44s)]
*  got to crack away from the hull. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=785.52s)]
*  I'm listening. I'm tilting this way. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=787.76s)]
*  Sight and laugh fence. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=789.76s)]
*  Sight and laugh fence, I serve. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=790.76s)]
*  Sight on that. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=791.76s)]
*  Sight on that. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=792.76s)]
*  Now we're starting to see water. See the water on the monitor? That's only water. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=793.76s)]
*  Once they get to a cruising level, they practice hide and seek with another sub. In some of [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=796.96s)]
*  the exercises, they also test fire blank torpedoes. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=802.8s)]
*  So I'm going to show you a torpedo tube. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=806.24s)]
*  One of their challenges is ice keels, huge chunks of ice that jut down from the surface [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=810.48s)]
*  and confuse sonar-guided torpedoes that can't distinguish them from enemy submarines. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=817.0s)]
*  So what we're working on is saying, hey, how can we fix that? How do we know we can go [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=822.88s)]
*  and shoot a weapon in the ice and get a hit? Right? So now we have to go up there and figure [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=827.68s)]
*  that out? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=833.2399999999999s)]
*  We return to the surface. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=834.28s)]
*  We're coming up right now. We're one, two, two feet. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=835.9599999999999s)]
*  One American sub in a region with a growing Russian military presence. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=838.3199999999999s)]
*  During our last day at the camp, something dramatic happened. A crack in the ice along [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=844.64s)]
*  the perimeter became a giant lake. New fissures formed right through the heart of the camp, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=850.12s)]
*  up to the doorstep of the command post. Everything was packed up quickly for an emergency evacuation, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=856.96s)]
*  a reminder that the most formidable adversary here may not be Russian forces, but the forces [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=863.96s)]
*  of nature. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=871.1600000000001s)]
*  Coral reefs are often called the rainforests of the ocean. They're not just biologically [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=874.6s)]
*  diverse and stunningly beautiful. They're a source of food and income for nearly a billion [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  people. They're also in danger. Scientists estimate that 25% of the world's reefs have [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=892.64s)]
*  died off, and much of what's left is at risk. There is, however, one spot in the Caribbean [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=898.58s)]
*  that marine biologists describe as a kind of underwater Eden, a coral reef largely untouched [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=904.18s)]
*  by man. It's called the Gardens of the Queen, and getting permission to go there isn't easy. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=910.42s)]
*  It's located off the coast of Cuba. And as you might have already guessed, there are no [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=915.78s)]
*  direct flights. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=920.2199999999999s)]
*  Our first stop was Havana, Cuba's crumbling capital, where music fills the air. Old cars [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=924.4599999999999s)]
*  seem to run forever, and the only ads you see are for the revolution. From there, we [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=932.3399999999999s)]
*  drove for six hours through the countryside and then took a boat for six hours more until [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=938.8399999999999s)]
*  we got to a stretch of tiny islands 50 miles off Cuba's southern coast. The islands are [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=944.06s)]
*  little more than patches of mangroves and small spits of sand. The only inhabitants [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=949.66s)]
*  who greeted us, hermit crabs and iguanas. They seemed indifferent to our arrival. It [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=954.4599999999999s)]
*  was Christopher Columbus who named this area the Gardens of the Queen after his queen Isabella. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=960.46s)]
*  But the real gardens, he probably never even got a glimpse of. To see them, you have to [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=965.5400000000001s)]
*  go underwater. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=970.94s)]
*  This is really the most incredibly well-protected and flourishing reef I've ever seen. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=979.94s)]
*  We went diving with David Guggenheim, an American marine biologist and a senior fellow [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=986.26s)]
*  at the Ocean Foundation in Washington, D.C. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=990.34s)]
*  The corals are healthy. The fish are healthy and abundant. There are predators here, large [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=993.22s)]
*  sharks. It's the way these ecosystems really should look. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=998.62s)]
*  You're saying this is like a time capsule, almost. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1003.86s)]
*  It's a living time machine, and it's a really incredible opportunity to learn from. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1006.14s)]
*  We brought special scuba masks with us so we could talk underwater. Every time we went [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1011.7s)]
*  diving, we could see sharks circling our boat before we even went in. David said they wouldn't [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1016.1400000000001s)]
*  bother us, and we certainly hoped he was right. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1021.86s)]
*  The first thing you notice in this underwater Eden is the coral. It's color. It's texture. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1025.38s)]
*  Coral isn't a rock or a plant. It's colonies of tiny animals that share a common skeleton. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1031.46s)]
*  This is a large and relatively rare specimen of pillar coral. Those hair-like things are [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1037.3s)]
*  the tentacles of thousands of individual animals that are plucking microscopic plankton from [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1042.02s)]
*  the water. Coral is one of the oldest living animals on the planet. Some of it is said [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1047.14s)]
*  to be 4,000 years old, older than the tallest redwood. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1052.5s)]
*  What makes coral reefs so important is that they host an extraordinary variety of fish. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1057.7s)]
*  Some come here for shelter from predators. Others come here to eat. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1063.18s)]
*  I've been diving in many places, all over the world, and I've never seen so many large [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1068.18s)]
*  fish like this grouper here. There's about six or seven Caribbean reef sharks like this [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1074.18s)]
*  circling around right now. Signs that will tell you the presence of so many sharks and [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1080.18s)]
*  different species of sharks is a sign that they're a very healthy reef. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1086.18s)]
*  When we call coral reefs the rainforests of the ocean, we're talking about the diversity [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1092.18s)]
*  of life that lives on these reefs. The relationships among these animals, the fact that the corals [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1096.18s)]
*  create a home for the fish, that there are little fish that feed big fish, that some [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1103.18s)]
*  of these little shrimp walk inside the mouths of the grouper and clean parasites off of [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1109.18s)]
*  the grouper. It's a very complex web of life. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1114.18s)]
*  You seem pleased to see all these predators, all these sharks around. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1117.18s)]
*  They're a very important part of the ecosystem, and we've kind of forgotten that because we've [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1119.18s)]
*  taken about 90% of the sharks out of the world's oceans over the last 50 years. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1124.18s)]
*  90% of the sharks have been killed already? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1129.18s)]
*  90% of the sharks are gone from the planet now, along with other predators like tuna [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1131.18s)]
*  and swordfish, these predators that we just love to eat. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1137.18s)]
*  Another predator under threat is the Goliath grouper, but here they're a common sight. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1140.18s)]
*  This one is about 200 pounds and shows no fear of a 160 pound correspondent. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1146.18s)]
*  It's amazing how curious this grouper is. It just comes up and looks you right in the eye. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1151.18s)]
*  David, do you ever see a grouper this big elsewhere? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1160.18s)]
*  Never, never in my life. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1163.18s)]
*  It's a critically endangered species. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1165.18s)]
*  When you say critically endangered, what do you mean? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1168.18s)]
*  Critically endangered is pretty much the highest level of endangerment before a species goes extinct completely. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1170.18s)]
*  The one species David wishes he didn't see thriving in the gardens of the Queen is the lionfish. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1179.18s)]
*  They appear to have been accidentally introduced into these waters by man. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1185.18s)]
*  They have venomous spines and no natural predators. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1189.18s)]
*  The lionfish is a beautiful fish. The problem is it doesn't belong here. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1192.18s)]
*  It belongs in the Pacific. It's got a vicious appetite, and it's eating the local species. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1197.18s)]
*  David Guggenheim is working with Fabian Pina, a Cuban marine biologist. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1205.18s)]
*  He leads a team that's been studying the reef for the Cuban Ministry of Science. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1210.18s)]
*  They've already identified seven species of marine life that they believe are new to science. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1214.18s)]
*  We saw a 200 pound grouper. Is that the biggest grouper that there is here? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1220.18s)]
*  Well, no, we have seen larger than that. We have seen some species of Goliath grouper like 400, 600 pounds. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1224.18s)]
*  400, 600 pounds. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1232.18s)]
*  Yes, it's like a small car. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1233.18s)]
*  The one I saw, the 200 pound one, I had the sense if I took a few inches too close it would let me know. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1235.18s)]
*  Yeah, sure. Maybe you hear down the water, boom, boom. That's the sound that is saying this is my territory. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1241.18s)]
*  So keep distance and dive and enjoy, but all the things around are mine. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1249.18s)]
*  Where did you learn to speak grouper? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1254.18s)]
*  Well, you know, 15 years ago. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1256.18s)]
*  Fabian Pina's office is little more than a shack built on posts in the water. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1261.18s)]
*  He was starting to explain why he liked working here so much when we were interrupted by one of his neighbors. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1266.18s)]
*  Wow, did you see that? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1272.18s)]
*  Magnificent. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1273.18s)]
*  You guys didn't get that, didn't know we would have got that, did they? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1274.18s)]
*  Huge bird just swooped down, that was cool. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1277.18s)]
*  Fabian told us nine foot crocodiles have paid him a visit as well. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1280.18s)]
*  Really? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1284.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1285.18s)]
*  I'm just going to readjust here and bring my leg up from dangling over the edge of the water. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1286.18s)]
*  Right there is a, now it's a great barracuda. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1289.18s)]
*  Right there. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1292.18s)]
*  Right there. So this is the only place where you can see from your porch an animal like that. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1293.18s)]
*  So it's wonderful. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1299.18s)]
*  It's wonderful and increasingly rare. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1303.18s)]
*  Only after seeing a place like this can you start to fully appreciate the tragedy that's occurring elsewhere in the oceans. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1305.18s)]
*  In 2002 I went to Veracruz, Mexico and I was told about the magnificence of the Veracruz Reefs. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1312.18s)]
*  And when we got there we saw that 95% of that reef had died. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1319.18s)]
*  And it had died quickly since the last time scientists were there. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1323.18s)]
*  And I felt like I was going through a city, a magnificent civilization had once stood there, but it was burned out. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1327.18s)]
*  Nobody was there. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1336.18s)]
*  Scientists say the world's reefs are being harmed by a complex combination of factors, including pollution, agricultural runoff, coastal development and overfishing. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1338.18s)]
*  It turns out fish are essential to the health of a reef. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1349.18s)]
*  Researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other leading institutions are also very concerned about climate change [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1352.18s)]
*  because they believe rising ocean temperatures are triggering a process called bleaching, in which the coral weakens, turns white and often dies. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1360.18s)]
*  This is a disaster in slow motion. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1369.18s)]
*  It's been happening for decades and it's much more difficult to see it happening, let alone get alarmed about it happening. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1372.18s)]
*  Scientists are always using the term crisis. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1381.18s)]
*  Is it really that bad what's happening under the water? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1383.18s)]
*  Things are really that bad. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1385.18s)]
*  We've already lost 25% of the world's coral reefs and within 20 years it'll be another 25%. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1387.18s)]
*  This is big. This is nice. It's going to be like 10, 15 years old fish. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1394.18s)]
*  The reason this reef is doing so well, Fabian Pina believes, is that it's far from the mainland and well protected. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1399.18s)]
*  That's a big fish. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1405.18s)]
*  In 1996, the government of Fidel Castro, a diver himself, made this area one of the largest marine preserves in the Caribbean. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1407.18s)]
*  Almost all commercial fishing was banned. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1414.18s)]
*  Since then, Fabian Pina's research shows the number of fish has increased dramatically. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1417.18s)]
*  How much have fish populations grown here? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1422.18s)]
*  Between 30 and 50%. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1424.18s)]
*  30 and 50%? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1426.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's huge. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1427.18s)]
*  Fabian and David have noticed some bleaching here, but the coral tends to recover after a few months, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1428.18s)]
*  leading them to wonder whether there's something about this reef that's making it more resistant to threats. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1434.18s)]
*  Maybe it's because this ecosystem is being protected. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1440.18s)]
*  It's got a leg up on other ecosystems around the world that are being heavily fished and heavily impacted by pollution. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1444.18s)]
*  So that makes it more resilient. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1451.18s)]
*  That's one of the theories, that if we do what we can locally, that these reefs have a better chance of being resilient to what's happening globally. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1453.18s)]
*  So something here holds the key to figuring out how to save these other reefs and bring them back in some cases. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1461.18s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1467.18s)]
*  Tourism here is tightly regulated. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1470.18s)]
*  Only 500 fly fishermen and 1,000 divers are permitted to come each year, and the fishermen have to release their catch. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1472.18s)]
*  Andres Jimenez helps run the only place to stay out here, a handful of boats operated by a company called Avalon. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1480.18s)]
*  It's a joint venture between the Cuban government and an Italian company, and it employs a lot of former fishermen and their families, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1487.18s)]
*  giving them a stake in preserving the area and keeping commercial fishing boats out. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1495.18s)]
*  If there was commercial fishing here now? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1499.18s)]
*  If there was commercial fishing here, or not only that, if we weren't here protecting and taking care of the area, it would be poof, very fast. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1501.18s)]
*  There's no way you can keep it safe. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1510.18s)]
*  All these big fish? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1512.18s)]
*  It's too big. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1513.18s)]
*  All the sharks, the group, all the big fish would all be gone. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1514.18s)]
*  They would take it in one day. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1516.18s)]
*  The fish aren't the only creatures here that enjoy protection. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1517.18s)]
*  The crocodiles are free to hunt in the shallow water near the islands. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1521.18s)]
*  Even these giant rodents called hutia are fearless. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1525.18s)]
*  Elsewhere in Cuba, they're made into stew. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1528.18s)]
*  Here, no one can hunt them. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1530.18s)]
*  They feel very safe here because we never eat one of these things. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1532.18s)]
*  Andres wanted to show us what the reef looked like at night. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1537.18s)]
*  So with some trepidation, we plunged into the black water. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1540.18s)]
*  The darkness was so complete, we felt like we were swimming through space. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1546.18s)]
*  But we found plenty of life on the seafloor. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1550.18s)]
*  You see that? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1553.18s)]
*  That is one big coral. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1554.18s)]
*  At night, you find all sorts of sea creatures that you would never see during the day, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1558.18s)]
*  like this crab right here, which we interrupted in the middle of its dinner. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1562.18s)]
*  Anderson, I want to show you these big moray eel here. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1568.18s)]
*  The eel didn't seem to want company. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1573.18s)]
*  So we moved on. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1576.18s)]
*  We spent several nights and days exploring the reef, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1579.18s)]
*  swimming through tunnels of living coral 100 feet below the surface. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1582.18s)]
*  We were so close to sharks, so often it was tempting to touch them. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1586.18s)]
*  It takes some time to adjust to the routine wonders of this place. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1591.18s)]
*  But after a while, even we began to feel like residents of the reef. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1596.18s)]
*  You know, in the conservation world, the work that I do, a lot of it is pretty negative. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1603.18s)]
*  You know, things have gotten pretty bad. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1609.18s)]
*  So to come to a place like this and see it so alive, you know, I feel like a teenager again. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1612.18s)]
*  I feel like there really is hope. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1617.18s)]
*  Every now and then, just for the fun of it, we decide to go off to some obscure place [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1630.18s)]
*  that you've never heard of and are not likely to visit. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1634.18s)]
*  Tonight, we're taking you to EGG, or the People's Republic of EGG, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1637.18s)]
*  as it's jokingly referred to in Scotland, a country where half the privately held land [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1641.18s)]
*  is owned by fewer than 500 people. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1646.18s)]
*  A lot of it is tied up in huge estates owned by lairds, who often run them as fiefdoms. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1649.18s)]
*  Twenty years ago, after two centuries of servility, the people of EGG drove away their laird [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1655.18s)]
*  and seized control of their own destiny, establishing the first community-owned estate in Scotland's history. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1660.18s)]
*  We wanted to see what they'd made of it. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1667.18s)]
*  Just three miles wide, six miles long, and ten miles off the Scottish coast, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1671.18s)]
*  EGG is part of the Inner Hebrides, surrounded by the isles of Rum, Muck and Skye [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1676.18s)]
*  at the edge of the North Atlantic. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1682.18s)]
*  It's an ungroomed masterpiece of nature, too wild to tame, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1685.18s)]
*  a craggy isle of incredible beauty populated mostly by sheep and the dogs that keep track of them. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1689.18s)]
*  The people do their best to stay clear while taking everything in. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1698.18s)]
*  So what's your average day like? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1702.18s)]
*  Some people would say very lazy. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1704.18s)]
*  I like to think I just make the hard work look easy. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1707.18s)]
*  It all depends on your outlook. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1712.18s)]
*  Charlie Galley is the taxi driver on EGG and the only source of public transportation [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1714.18s)]
*  up and down the island's furrowed main artery. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1720.18s)]
*  It's a niche he claimed for himself when he arrived from the mainland with his wife [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1724.18s)]
*  in this aging Volvo four years ago. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1728.18s)]
*  Plenty of time to get the feel of the place. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1731.18s)]
*  You know everybody on the island? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1734.18s)]
*  I know them and their shoe sizes and like I say there's no stickers on an island. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1736.18s)]
*  So what are they talking about this week? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1743.18s)]
*  Mainly you. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1745.18s)]
*  It's not like they don't get visitors. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1748.18s)]
*  12,000 tourists came here last year, most of them to spend only a few hours. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1751.18s)]
*  There are very few places to stay. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1755.18s)]
*  We were going to be here for days asking questions about EGG's quirky history [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1758.18s)]
*  and everyone directed us to Maggie Fife, the island's secretary, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1763.18s)]
*  who landed here 41 years ago after touring Afghanistan in a camper. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1767.18s)]
*  I never imagined that I would spend the rest of my life here. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1772.18s)]
*  Does that mean you like it? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1775.18s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1776.18s)]
*  It was 1976, just after the entire island had been purchased by a wealthy English toff [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1779.18s)]
*  named Keith Schellenberg who became the seventh laird of EGG. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1785.18s)]
*  Welcome to EGG. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1790.18s)]
*  Under Scotland's feudal landlord system, he had absolute power over virtually every aspect of his estate. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1791.18s)]
*  What kind of impact did he have on people's lives? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1798.18s)]
*  He had that control over everything, people, jobs, houses, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1800.18s)]
*  and he wouldn't give anybody a lease on anything. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1805.18s)]
*  By all accounts, Schellenberg used the island as his personal playground, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1808.18s)]
*  lavishly entertaining guests in driving about in a 1927 Rolls-Royce, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1812.18s)]
*  while most of his tenants lived in poverty without electricity. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1818.18s)]
*  Was there a rebellion? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1822.18s)]
*  Eventually, yeah. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1824.18s)]
*  It started with a slow burn that burst into flames one night in 1994 [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1827.18s)]
*  when Schellenberg's beloved Rolls-Royce met a fiery end, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1833.18s)]
*  burnt to a crisp like a slice of bacon under circumstances still unexplained. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1837.18s)]
*  A mysterious fire, spontaneous combustion, who knows. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1843.18s)]
*  So did you ever figure out what happened to the Rolls-Royce? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1848.18s)]
*  No. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1852.18s)]
*  Headline writers all over Britain couldn't believe their luck. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1854.18s)]
*  There was scrambled egg, burnt rolls, and egg comes to the boil. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1857.18s)]
*  It went on for a year until Schellenberg gave up, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1862.18s)]
*  expressing his disdain for the islanders in this BBC interview. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1865.18s)]
*  I think that my ultimate failure with EGG is that I can't be bothered to try and get on with them anymore. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1869.18s)]
*  His final act was to sell the island to a wacky German who called himself Maruma [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1876.18s)]
*  and claimed to be an artist of note and a professor. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1881.18s)]
*  He turned out to be neither. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1884.18s)]
*  Up to his beret and debt, Maruma stopped paying people's wages [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1886.18s)]
*  and within two years, creditors put EGG up for auction. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1890.18s)]
*  Maggie Fife and others thought, why not buy the island for ourselves? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1893.18s)]
*  By the time we got to Maruma and two years of somebody that was living in Stuttgart [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1898.18s)]
*  and had only visited for four days, it convinced everybody [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1903.18s)]
*  that we wouldn't have to do very much to do better than what he'd done, which was nothing. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1907.18s)]
*  No one in Scotland had ever tried a community buyout before, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1914.18s)]
*  certainly not 64 residents on a depressed, undeveloped island with no cash or credit. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1918.18s)]
*  But lots of people were familiar with their story [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1924.18s)]
*  and fancied the idea of Wee Folk taking on the big guys. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1927.18s)]
*  In 1997, a public fundraising campaign brought in $2.5 million to close the deal. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1932.18s)]
*  The funds came from 10,000 individual contributors and one huge check from an unknown woman. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1939.18s)]
*  The bulk of the money came from a mystery benefactor. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1945.18s)]
*  A mystery benefactor? Sounds like Dickens. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1950.18s)]
*  It's a pretty crazy story, really. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1953.18s)]
*  You don't know who she is? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1955.18s)]
*  The only string attached was that she remained anonymous. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1957.18s)]
*  She ever been to the island? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1960.18s)]
*  Not as far as I know. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1962.18s)]
*  Do you know why she did it? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1963.18s)]
*  I think she's given money to a lot of what she regards as good causes [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1964.18s)]
*  and we were lucky enough to be one of them. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1968.18s)]
*  That was 20 years ago. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1973.18s)]
*  The Eggers and their friends marked the two decades of self-rule [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1975.18s)]
*  with a big blowout they call akeli, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1978.18s)]
*  with traditional music, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1982.18s)]
*  dancing [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1984.18s)]
*  and drink. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1986.18s)]
*  We decided to cancel the next day's shoot to allow time for recovery, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1991.18s)]
*  but 24 hours wasn't enough. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1995.18s)]
*  What time did you leave the keli? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=1999.18s)]
*  It was about 8 a.m. I think when we finally left, yeah. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2001.18s)]
*  How long did it take you to recover? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2004.18s)]
*  It took probably tomorrow. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2006.18s)]
*  Johnny Jobson first experienced egg in his 20s, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2009.18s)]
*  working on a fishing boat as a scallop diver. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2013.18s)]
*  Since then, a lot has changed. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2016.18s)]
*  One, there is electricity now, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2018.18s)]
*  which allowed him to move his wife and family here last year [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2020.18s)]
*  and added a sports journal online from their tiny cottage. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2024.18s)]
*  It's required some sacrifices, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2028.18s)]
*  but they love the beauty of the place and its eccentricities. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2030.18s)]
*  You look at the scenery or you see a pod of dolphins come through [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2034.18s)]
*  and you just remind yourself how lucky you are. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2038.18s)]
*  You seem to have a lot of characters on this island. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2042.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2045.18s)]
*  They're very strong. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2047.18s)]
*  Were they normal when they came here? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2049.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, not all of us. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2052.1800000000003s)]
*  Dean Wiggin turned up in a kayak 14 years ago and he's still here. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2055.1800000000003s)]
*  He's very good at fixing things. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2060.1800000000003s)]
*  Jobs are extremely scarce, so you have to bring one with you [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2063.1800000000003s)]
*  or use your wits to invent one. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2067.1800000000003s)]
*  It's one of those places that really gets into your soul. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2069.1800000000003s)]
*  I think it's quite enchanting. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2072.1800000000003s)]
*  Sarah Bowden runs her uncle's sheep farm on Egg. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2074.18s)]
*  She grew up here, then left to work as a music journalist in London [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2077.18s)]
*  where she met her future partner, Johnny Lynch, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2082.18s)]
*  one of Scotland's most popular musicians. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2085.18s)]
*  She coaxed him to Egg. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2089.18s)]
*  Did you think he was going to come? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2091.18s)]
*  Not really. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2093.18s)]
*  No, because I was living in a caravan at the time [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2096.18s)]
*  and it was all quite rustic. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2100.18s)]
*  You did look a bit shocked. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2103.18s)]
*  And Johnny's a proper suburban city. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2105.18s)]
*  What? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2109.18s)]
*  Well, you're not an actual country boy, are you? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2111.18s)]
*  If you mean I look after my nails, then yes, I do. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2113.18s)]
*  But I knew from the moment I got here [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2116.18s)]
*  I couldn't really see a reason for me to go back [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2119.18s)]
*  and just look at me now. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2122.18s)]
*  See if you can spell it. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2125.18s)]
*  When it comes to the essentials on Egg, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2127.18s)]
*  there is basically one of everything. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2129.18s)]
*  One primary school for five students, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2131.18s)]
*  one grocery shop where a hundred islanders [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2134.18s)]
*  all choose from the same food, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2136.18s)]
*  and one pub at the tea room down by the wharf [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2138.18s)]
*  where the best beer is local. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2141.18s)]
*  Stu McCarthy and Gabe McVarish, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2144.18s)]
*  who were both married to women who grew up on Egg, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2146.18s)]
*  got so tired of drinking the mass-produced stuff [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2149.18s)]
*  from the mainland, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2152.18s)]
*  they started their own mini-microbrewery two years ago. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2154.18s)]
*  So this is it? Is this legal? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2157.18s)]
*  It's legal. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2159.18s)]
*  They make eight different brews, including I Am the Egg Man, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2161.18s)]
*  which is very popular with the tourists. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2164.18s)]
*  They're just beginning to turn a profit, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2166.18s)]
*  but say they've saved a lot of money drinking their own beer. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2168.18s)]
*  Are you the biggest-selling beer on Egg? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2171.18s)]
*  Thankfully, yes. Yeah, we can say that. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2174.18s)]
*  None of these younger people would be here [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2179.18s)]
*  without the island's tiny but unique power grid [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2181.18s)]
*  that runs almost entirely on renewable energy. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2184.18s)]
*  A combination of wind, hydroelectric and solar, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2187.18s)]
*  the first time it's ever been accomplished anywhere. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2191.18s)]
*  That is the biggest and most impressive project [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2194.18s)]
*  that we've done. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2197.18s)]
*  It changed everything, right? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2199.18s)]
*  Oh, yes, made life so much easier. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2201.18s)]
*  It was designed and funded with multiple grants, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2203.18s)]
*  mostly from the European Union, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2205.18s)]
*  and engineers from all over the world have come to study it. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2207.18s)]
*  Like everything else on Egg, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2210.18s)]
*  it is run and maintained by revolving, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2212.18s)]
*  committees of islanders, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2215.18s)]
*  the only visible sign of any sort of government. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2217.18s)]
*  There are no offices, no court system, no police. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2220.18s)]
*  Is there any crime on the island? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2223.18s)]
*  There's no crime or anything. Never? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2225.18s)]
*  Not that I can remember. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2227.18s)]
*  Nobody's snatched something or borrowed something? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2229.18s)]
*  They borrow it, and you'll get it usually within the week, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2233.18s)]
*  you know, returned to you kind of thing. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2237.18s)]
*  You just don't know where it is at that point in time, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2239.18s)]
*  when you're looking for it. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2242.18s)]
*  But it will turn up again. It can't go anywhere. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2244.18s)]
*  It's on an island, so, yeah. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2246.18s)]
*  What happens if somebody gets sick? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2248.18s)]
*  You basically have to be sick on a Tuesday. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2250.18s)]
*  A doctor comes from Skye on a Tuesday, spends the day here, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2252.18s)]
*  and that's, say, sometimes weather permitting. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2256.18s)]
*  It's really rough in the wintertime. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2259.18s)]
*  Egg is dependent on boats for everything. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2261.18s)]
*  When a ferry comes in with fuel and food, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2264.18s)]
*  people flock to the wharf to help out. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2266.18s)]
*  It's not a courtesy, it's a necessity on an island [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2269.18s)]
*  where everyone is more or less scraping by. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2272.18s)]
*  To survive, they have to rely on each other, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2275.18s)]
*  look after each other, and put up with each other. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2278.18s)]
*  The island is too small for feuds or lingering resentments. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2281.18s)]
*  What's the difference between people who live on the mainland [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2285.18s)]
*  and people who live on egg? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2288.18s)]
*  Well, the people on egg, I'd have to say, are more evolved. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2290.18s)]
*  Charlie Galley, the taxi driver and amateur philosopher, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2295.18s)]
*  says most people here have done the whole life on the mainland thing [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2299.18s)]
*  and rejected it. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2303.18s)]
*  They're all doing their hamster wheel thing, you know? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2305.18s)]
*  Hamster wheel. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2307.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2308.18s)]
*  You get a mortgage, you get a car, you get a job, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2309.18s)]
*  you do this and that thing, and they all get so involved, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2311.18s)]
*  they forget to look about them and see what's actually going on in life. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2313.18s)]
*  You should know egg is not always served sunny-side up. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2320.18s)]
*  As the days get shorter, the windy, rainy weather turns to sleet [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2323.18s)]
*  with gusts up to 100 miles an hour. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2327.18s)]
*  The boats might not get through for a week, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2330.18s)]
*  so people keep lots of beans and spam in the store room. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2332.18s)]
*  Even the sheep dogs look forlorn. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2336.18s)]
*  If you accidentally open your mouth when a gust of wind's coming [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2339.18s)]
*  and it involuntarily fills your lungs, you're like... [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2342.18s)]
*  To live here, you have to be resilient, self-sufficient and patient. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2346.18s)]
*  And not just with the sheep. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2354.18s)]
*  The cows like to go down and lie on the beach on the sand, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2357.18s)]
*  and they'll all trail down the road, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2360.18s)]
*  so you can't argue with a cow, you know? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2362.18s)]
*  It wants to do what it wants to do, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2365.18s)]
*  and you've just got to give it plenty of time, you know? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2367.18s)]
*  There are no grand ambitions here [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2370.18s)]
*  and no discernible interest in development, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2372.18s)]
*  despite the sea, the cliffs and the vistas. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2374.18s)]
*  The owners don't want hotels or a Donald Trump golf course [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2377.18s)]
*  or hundreds of new residents. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2381.18s)]
*  I think we're looking for one or two at a time. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2383.18s)]
*  I think that's how it works here. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2385.18s)]
*  Then it works a lot better, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2387.18s)]
*  and we've got time to get used to new people. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2389.18s)]
*  We would have liked to stay longer in this stress-free, non-conflict zone [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2395.18s)]
*  where everyone seems to be more or less on the same page. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2399.18s)]
*  But we were out of clean laundry, we had a ferry to catch [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2403.18s)]
*  and hamster wheels to jump back onto. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2406.18s)]
*  As for the people of Egg, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2409.18s)]
*  I don't think they were sad to see us go. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2411.18s)]
*  The World's Greatest Whiskey [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2416.18s)]
*  The World's Greatest Whiskey [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2419.18s)]
*  The World's Greatest Whiskey [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2422.18s)]
*  The World's Greatest Whiskey [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2425.18s)]
*  60 Minutes is constantly on the lookout [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2428.18s)]
*  for places we've never been before. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2430.18s)]
*  So when our late colleague Bob Simon [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2432.18s)]
*  heard about a magical place in the Hebrides Islands [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2434.18s)]
*  off the coast of Scotland, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2437.18s)]
*  known for making some of the great whiskies in the world, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2439.18s)]
*  well, the story spoke to him. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2441.18s)]
*  The place is called Islay, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2443.18s)]
*  and it's one of five whiskey-producing regions in Scotland [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2445.18s)]
*  that make an expensive type of scotch called single malt. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2448.18s)]
*  Islay's distilleries turn out relatively small amounts [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2452.18s)]
*  of their own hand-crafted brands [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2455.18s)]
*  for a worldwide luxury market that's more than doubled in size [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2457.18s)]
*  in the last decade, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2461.18s)]
*  and become the spirit equivalent of the fine wine business. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2463.18s)]
*  Bob liked good scotch in beautiful places, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2466.18s)]
*  so he went off to Scotland. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2469.18s)]
*  He died before he could finish the piece, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2471.18s)]
*  leaving behind a stack of videotapes and some random notes. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2473.18s)]
*  We decided to finish it for him [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2477.18s)]
*  and raise a glass in his memory. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2479.18s)]
*  Islay is a small island 20 miles off the west coast of Scotland. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2484.18s)]
*  There are few trees, miles of windswept heather, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2488.18s)]
*  and some of the most fertile agricultural land in Scotland. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2491.18s)]
*  There are sheep and cattle everywhere [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2495.18s)]
*  and an abundance of wildlife. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2497.18s)]
*  But that's not why people come here. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2499.18s)]
*  This is, eight small distilleries [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2501.18s)]
*  that produce some of the world's finest single malt whiskeys. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2503.18s)]
*  This is the whole life, blood of this island and everybody on it. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2507.18s)]
*  This is all we know. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2511.18s)]
*  Jim McEwen has been working at Islay's distillery [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2513.18s)]
*  since he was 15 years old. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2516.18s)]
*  He's now master of the works at Brooklottie. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2518.18s)]
*  I just thank God that he chose the Scots and gave them whisky, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2521.18s)]
*  because we appreciate the gift and we look after it. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2526.18s)]
*  They've been making it here since the 15th century, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2529.18s)]
*  when supposedly some monks taught the locals how to use barley, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2532.18s)]
*  water and yeast to make a spirit the Scots now call the water of life. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2536.18s)]
*  They've been perfecting it for 600 years. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2541.18s)]
*  The distilleries are easy to find, but hard to pronounce. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2544.18s)]
*  Ardbeg, Behmore, Brooklottie, Boonahabin, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2548.18s)]
*  Colila, Kilhoman, Lagavulin and Laphroa. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2553.18s)]
*  As Bob Simon noted, they get harder to pronounce the more you visit. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2558.18s)]
*  For us guys in the West Coast of Scotland, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2562.18s)]
*  whisky is a religion because it's a provider. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2564.18s)]
*  The great thing about whisky is it's not just a drink. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2566.18s)]
*  It's much more than that. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2569.18s)]
*  Have you ever watched some old Hollywood movies? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2570.18s)]
*  Yes, I have. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2572.18s)]
*  Scotch was always portrayed in Hollywood as a whisky. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2573.18s)]
*  When you were down or you were in trouble, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2576.18s)]
*  the one thing that was going to get you back on your feet and out there [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2578.18s)]
*  was the Scotch. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2581.18s)]
*  Today, if you're down on your luck, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2583.18s)]
*  you probably can't afford an Islay single malt. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2585.18s)]
*  The good ones started around $70 a bottle. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2587.18s)]
*  The rare ones can go for hundreds of dollars a glass [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2590.18s)]
*  at chic whisky bars around the world, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2593.18s)]
*  where they're known for their distinctive smoky taste. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2595.18s)]
*  It comes from peat, the mossy earthen fuel that's cut from bogs on the island. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2599.18s)]
*  It was used to heat Scottish homes for centuries [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2604.18s)]
*  and is still used to toast the barley at Islay Distilleries. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2607.18s)]
*  John Campbell is the master distiller at LaFroy, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2611.18s)]
*  one of the top-selling single malts in America. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2614.18s)]
*  Peat is the thing that makes Islay unique, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2617.18s)]
*  and it really resonates with people, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2619.18s)]
*  and it just engenders a kind of love-hate relationship. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2621.18s)]
*  And the people that love it absolutely love it with a passion. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2625.18s)]
*  And there seems to be no shortage of them. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2628.18s)]
*  Islay is not easy to get to, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2632.18s)]
*  usually requiring multiple flights, a long drive, and a two-hour ferry ride. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2634.18s)]
*  Yet enthusiasts continue to make the pilgrimage, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2639.18s)]
*  especially for the Whisky Festival. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2642.18s)]
*  We get literally thousands upon thousands of single malt tourists coming here. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2644.18s)]
*  They come from all over the world just to set foot on the island. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2650.18s)]
*  To study it? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2654.18s)]
*  No, to drink it. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2655.18s)]
*  It's lovely. It's clean. It's fresh. It's vibrant. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2656.18s)]
*  Officially, Whisky Fest is a celebration of Islay's culture, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2660.18s)]
*  but mostly it's about drinking. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2664.18s)]
*  Absolutely beautiful. No off-notes at all. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2666.18s)]
*  As they listen to Jim McEwen extol the virtues of brook Lottie, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2669.18s)]
*  the novitiates, connoisseurs, and whiskey snobs [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2672.18s)]
*  approached each glass with reverence bordering on the religious. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2675.18s)]
*  Oh, wow. The fruit in that is incredible. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2679.18s)]
*  As the glass is empty, the smiles got bigger. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2683.18s)]
*  But the islanders will tell you that all of this warmth and good feeling [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2686.18s)]
*  comes not from the alcohol and the spirits, but from the spirit of the place. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2690.18s)]
*  It is almost mystical, beautiful, dramatic, and quiet. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2695.18s)]
*  There's no road rage, barely any traffic. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2700.18s)]
*  If you do get hung up, it's probably because of a farm animal. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2703.18s)]
*  They have the right of way. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2706.18s)]
*  And if you do happen upon people, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2709.18s)]
*  they'll almost always greet you with the Islay Wave. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2711.18s)]
*  Everybody just waves because it's just friendly. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2715.18s)]
*  There's not so many of us, so you just wave to say hi. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2717.18s)]
*  It's what Elsa Hayes liked about the island [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2720.18s)]
*  when she moved her family here from London [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2722.18s)]
*  to take a manager's position at one of Islay's thriving distilleries. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2724.18s)]
*  It's strange, is it not? It's such a small place with so few people. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2728.18s)]
*  Your products are known everywhere in the world. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2733.18s)]
*  I know. It makes us all very proud. It does. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2737.18s)]
*  There's such a boom worldwide for single malts. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2740.18s)]
*  It's fantastic. You can really feel that on the island. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2744.18s)]
*  A lot of the distilleries have doubled production, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2747.18s)]
*  so there's a lot of opportunities there as well. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2750.18s)]
*  And there's no reason to believe that that won't continue. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2753.18s)]
*  Well, times are good, people drink. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2756.18s)]
*  Times are bad, people drink. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2758.18s)]
*  Is it possible to be socially acceptable to be a teetotaler on this island? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2761.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2766.18s)]
*  Are there any? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2767.18s)]
*  Yes. I'm not one of them. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2768.18s)]
*  Over the years, the island's people have learned how to entertain themselves, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2772.18s)]
*  often at gatherings called Cailies, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2776.18s)]
*  which feature traditional dance and sad songs, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2778.18s)]
*  mostly about leaving Islay and yearning to return. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2781.18s)]
*  To set with my love on the bridge above the rippling waterfall [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2785.18s)]
*  To go back home, never more to roam [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2796.18s)]
*  Is my dearest wish of all [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2802.18s)]
*  If this looks and feels a lot like Ireland, that's no coincidence. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2808.18s)]
*  It's only 25 miles away. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2812.18s)]
*  They come from the same tribe, share the same Celtic culture and Gaelic language, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2814.18s)]
*  not to mention a love of good whiskey that gets them through stormy weather and the long winter nights. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2819.18s)]
*  There are no movie theaters on island, no dry cleaners, no supermarkets, no McDonald's, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2825.18s)]
*  at least in the fast food business. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2830.18s)]
*  Jim McEwen says there's a long list of things that Islay doesn't have and doesn't want. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2832.18s)]
*  We don't have any crime. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2837.18s)]
*  We don't have mugging, carjacking, house baking, rape, just dope drugs. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2839.18s)]
*  We don't have that. You can keep that. You're very welcome to it. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2847.18s)]
*  How do you explain the fact that there's no crime here? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2851.18s)]
*  There's crime everywhere else. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2854.18s)]
*  If you commit a crime in a small community, you'll be ostracized and have to leave. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2856.18s)]
*  Not only that, your family, your children and your children's children will be remembered [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2861.18s)]
*  as the children of the man who committed the crime. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2868.18s)]
*  Most Scots are forthright, practical people who are proud of their country [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2871.18s)]
*  and the fact that their most famous export has withstood the test of time. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2875.18s)]
*  They see themselves as artisans and making whiskey is more about art and alchemy than manufacturing. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2880.18s)]
*  Every distiller has their own secrets and superstitions. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2886.18s)]
*  We'll give you the unclassified two-minute tour. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2889.18s)]
*  Sorry, we can't offer you free samples. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2892.18s)]
*  It begins with a bit of trickery on the molting floor when barley that's been soaked in water [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2895.18s)]
*  is spread out and raked over and over to convince the grain it's spring and time to germinate, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2901.18s)]
*  releasing the starches that are locked inside. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2907.18s)]
*  It's then dried with peat smoke to add flavor and ground into flour, sometimes with 19th century machinery, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2910.18s)]
*  and then mixed with hot water, transforming the starches into a sugary concoction called mash. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2918.18s)]
*  You smell that, Bob? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2925.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2927.18s)]
*  You can smell the goodness. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2928.18s)]
*  Yeast is then added, changing the sugar into alcohol, a primitive ale, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2929.18s)]
*  which is then cooked a couple of times in copper stills where the vapor is collected [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2934.18s)]
*  and condensed into this clear liquid. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2939.18s)]
*  And that's the stuff we want to go into the barrel. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2941.18s)]
*  But what I'm looking at is this looks like rubbing alcohol. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2944.18s)]
*  This is in fact the whiskey. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2947.18s)]
*  It's very good. If you need a rub, there's no doubt about it. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2949.18s)]
*  I bet it would be good. But once this goes into the barrel, from then it's just time. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2951.18s)]
*  It's just time. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2955.18s)]
*  And it's a great journey, you know. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2956.18s)]
*  This is a child, but the cask is the mother. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2958.18s)]
*  And that's what makes the journey. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2962.18s)]
*  If you give a good cask, you're bound to get a good child. It's that simple. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2964.18s)]
*  It takes less than three weeks to make, but requires at least 10 years of aging in these oak casks, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2968.18s)]
*  which add flavor and color to turn it into world-class single malt whiskey. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2974.18s)]
*  You'll see some of the names. There's Clement Springs, Buffalo Trees, Jim Beam. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2978.18s)]
*  Bob was surprised to learn that 97% of the casks used to make single malt whiskey [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2986.18s)]
*  had been previously used to age American bourbon and bought secondhand from U.S. distillers. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2991.18s)]
*  It's testimony to the ingenuity and frugality of the Scots, who have very few oak trees. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=2997.18s)]
*  Without the American bottle, there would be no whiskey industry. It's as simple as that. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3003.18s)]
*  A sophisticated palate will detect a hint of the oak and bourbon in Isla's single malt, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3007.18s)]
*  as well as the sweetness of sherry that comes from wine casks bought in Europe. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3012.18s)]
*  Before the final product is sold, it will have done time in a number of different casks. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3017.18s)]
*  Master distiller Jim McEwen is the one who decides when to rotate them [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3022.18s)]
*  and when each barrel is ready to be bottled. He opened a young cask for Bob to sample. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3027.18s)]
*  I would describe that as mellow yellow, absolutely pure. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3032.18s)]
*  And it's only seven years old. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3037.18s)]
*  That's right. Young whiskeys are like young people. They're vibrant, they're full of life. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3039.18s)]
*  In fact, this for me is like coming home from work. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3043.18s)]
*  At the end of the day, I work really hard and nobody appreciates me. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3047.18s)]
*  My wife doesn't appreciate me, my kids don't appreciate me. Life's a bitch. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3052.18s)]
*  A couple glasses of that and it doesn't matter. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3056.18s)]
*  A couple of shots of that and I am the king of the world. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3059.18s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3061.18s)]
*  You know, frankly, I never liked this stuff, but the way you're talking me into it. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3062.18s)]
*  But you've got to check every barrel. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3066.18s)]
*  Absolutely, I hope so. Cheers. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3068.18s)]
*  McEwen is the man responsible for the taste and consistency of the whiskeys at Brooklottie, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3070.18s)]
*  which requires a very personal involvement with the product. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3075.18s)]
*  I have heard you described as the cask whisperer. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3079.18s)]
*  I do talk to casks. There's no doubt about it. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3083.18s)]
*  In what language? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3086.18s)]
*  Mainly English and it depends on many whiskies I've had. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3088.18s)]
*  If I've had a few whiskers, I tend to revert to the Gaelic language. I'm talking to the cask. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3091.18s)]
*  It's just one of these things. You go into the warehouse and you pop the bung out. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3095.18s)]
*  You draw your sample, yeah, and you look at it and you think, wow, you're beautiful. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3099.18s)]
*  But you're not just ready yet. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3104.18s)]
*  Tell you what, I'm going to come back and see you in three months, okay? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3107.18s)]
*  And other times you find a cask which is so incredibly good, you can't not speak. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3110.18s)]
*  You say, oh my God, you are the most beautiful thing I have ever tasted in my life. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3116.18s)]
*  And you think, oh, jeez, I just want to share this with somebody. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3122.18s)]
*  But there's nobody around. It's just me and the cask. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3125.18s)]
*  We'll stay. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3127.18s)]
*  On most days, McEwen devotes several hours to quality control, checking up on several hundred casks. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3129.18s)]
*  But it's a fantastic job, nosing and tasting whiskies. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3135.18s)]
*  And you can still walk out of here in the evening. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3140.18s)]
*  Occasionally I need some help. There's no doubt about that. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3142.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3145.18s)]
*  Dying devotion to one's whiskey is apparently not all that unusual. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3146.18s)]
*  While we were on Isle of the Cameracoo ran into a party of Canadians, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3151.18s)]
*  the friends and family of a deceased single malt lover named Bill, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3155.18s)]
*  who wanted his ashes scattered in the waters opposite his favorite distillery. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3160.18s)]
*  Funds for the pilgrimage were set aside in his will. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3165.18s)]
*  That's why he wants it. It's good. It's good. To Bill. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3168.18s)]
*  To Bill. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3174.18s)]
*  To Jim. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3175.18s)]
*  Now he's happy. Now he's happy. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3180.18s)]
*  After that, the only thing left was for Bob to say goodbye to Jim McEwen. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3185.18s)]
*  And it turned out to be last call for our old pal, Bob Simon. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3189.18s)]
*  Cheers, Bob. Hope you've enjoyed this little visit here. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3194.18s)]
*  You're speaking in the past. It's not over. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3197.18s)]
*  Yeah. I'm going to get you out of here, man. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3199.18s)]
*  This is costing me a fortune. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRbobCE7jsQ&t=3201.18s)]
