# George Clooney, Jennifer Lawrence, Denzel Washington, Kate Winslet and more | 60 Minutes Marathon
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0)
*  DENZEL WASHINGTON [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=0.0s)]
*  DENZEL WASHINGTON [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9.0s)]
*  Denzel Washington has been acting for more than 40 years, playing almost everything. Shakespeare, gangsters, action heroes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=13.0s)]
*  Now at 61, in what he calls his fourth quarter, Denzel Washington has decided to focus on a project that's more important to him than any work he's done, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=22.0s)]
*  bringing to the screen the works of one of America's greatest playwrights, the late August Wilson, winner of two Pulitzer Prizes. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=32.0s)]
*  Wilson, who died in 2005, wrote 10 iconic plays known as the American Century Cycle, which explore the Black American experience in each decade of the 20th century. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=41.0s)]
*  Denzel has committed to producing all of them, nine for HBO. But Fences, Wilson's most popular work, opens in movie theaters this Christmas. Denzel directs as well as stars. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=53.0s)]
*  I understand that you made it clear to everybody on the set that you're not after good, you're after great, and that anybody who's coming to work on this film has to want great. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=67.0s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=79.0s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=80.0s)]
*  Well, the best you can be. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=81.0s)]
*  Joy, you ought to stop that lying. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=83.0s)]
*  Fences is set in Pittsburgh in the 1950s and 60s, when racial integration was just gaining a toehold. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=85.0s)]
*  He ain't said nothing. He told me to go down to the commissioner's office next Friday. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=92.0s)]
*  Washington plays 53-year-old Troy Maxson, whose life is defined by his big personality and his bigger disappointments. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=95.0s)]
*  Why me? Because I asked a question. That's all I did. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=104.0s)]
*  He is a garbage man who had great ability to play baseball, but he came along at a time. Blacks weren't accepted yet in the big leagues. So he was frustrated by that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=107.0s)]
*  Anybody can drive a truck. How come you got all the whites driving and colored lipids? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=118.0s)]
*  Rolling! [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=123.0s)]
*  Washington filmed Fences in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, a once vibrant black neighborhood where August Wilson grew up. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=124.0s)]
*  The people who went to work and to church and raised their families here inspired many of his plays. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=131.0s)]
*  It's a Pittsburgh story, and I want it to be in Pittsburgh. The stories I get from people, all of that helps to feed the film. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=138.0s)]
*  Washington turned this vacant Hill District house into the Maxson family home, familiar to many of us who grew up in a black working class neighborhood at the time. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=146.0s)]
*  I swear I know this house. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=155.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. Now, okay, now you tell me. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=157.0s)]
*  My aunt lived in this house. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=160.0s)]
*  Yeah? The front room and the? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=162.0s)]
*  Uh-huh. The parlor. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=164.0s)]
*  The parlor? I'll take you for the tour. This is the dining room? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=165.0s)]
*  The dining room. And this? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=168.0s)]
*  You got Jesus, my little thing? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=170.0s)]
*  In the 60s, this was in every African American house. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=172.0s)]
*  You know I had to put that in there. You know I put that in there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=176.0s)]
*  Every African American house. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=179.0s)]
*  You know it. And they ought to be felt. You know that black or whatever that felt stuff, right? Of course. You got Jesus, Martin Luther King, and John F. Kennedy, and her baby. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=181.0s)]
*  See, you notice you don't have no pictures of Troy up there. That's terrible, actually. This is the backyard. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=190.0s)]
*  The action takes place right out here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=195.0s)]
*  What are y'all out here getting into? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=197.0s)]
*  You worried about what we getting into, full woman? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=199.0s)]
*  Fences is the story of a family unraveling. Troy, from his wife Rose, and from his son Cory. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=201.0s)]
*  Look, boy. The white man ain't going to let you get nowhere with no football, no way. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=209.0s)]
*  Now you get your book learning so you can work your way up at the A&P and learn how to fix cars or build houses. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=215.0s)]
*  He'll get you a trade. This way you got something, can't nobody take away from you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=221.0s)]
*  Do you see your father in Troy? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=224.0s)]
*  In some regards, he couldn't read well. He had the same conversation with me about getting a good trade. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=228.0s)]
*  You know, he worked for the water department in New York. And he could get me on at the water department. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=236.0s)]
*  He said, you know, I could be a supervisor in 25 years. He's like, you get a good job, you get a trade. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=242.0s)]
*  A secure job. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=247.0s)]
*  Exactly. And like Rose, my mother could see further. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=248.0s)]
*  You know, no, he's got to get an education, he's got to go to college, and you know, he couldn't see that far. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=253.0s)]
*  Times have changed, Troy. People change. The world changed and then you can't even see it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=259.0s)]
*  Huh. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=266.0s)]
*  Woman, I do the best I can do. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=271.0s)]
*  I come in there every Friday, I carry a sack of potatoes and a bucket of lard. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=275.0s)]
*  You all line up at the door with your hands out. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=279.0s)]
*  I give you the lint from my pockets, I give you my sweat and my blood. I ain't got no tears, I done spent them. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=283.0s)]
*  We go upstairs in that room at night, I fall down on you and try to blast the hole into forever. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=289.0s)]
*  I get up Monday morning, find my lunch on the table, go out and make my way, find my strength to get me through the next Friday. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=295.0s)]
*  That's all I got, Rose. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=304.0s)]
*  I remember seeing my father in the driveway listening to the ballgame. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=306.0s)]
*  I remember the door would be open, he had his foot out, and he's just listening to the ballgame. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=312.0s)]
*  And I realized, as of when I got older, it was the only place where he had a chance to, he'd just dealt with one boss. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=316.0s)]
*  Now he's about to go in the house and my mother's in there, the other boss, and he had maybe 10 minutes to himself to be the boss. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=324.0s)]
*  In the driveway. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=331.0s)]
*  In the driveway. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=332.0s)]
*  Listening to the ballgame. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=333.0s)]
*  Listening to the ballgame, and because he had to come home and eat and then go to the night job. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=334.0s)]
*  Do you tap into that to bring that out into the performance? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=338.0s)]
*  It's in there. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=344.0s)]
*  It's gotta be. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=345.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's gotta be. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=346.0s)]
*  Viola Davis told us she admired Denzel Washington long before they acted in Fences together on Broadway. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=347.0s)]
*  When I was younger, I just thought he was good looking, you know, so I was like, oh, Denzel is so good looking. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=356.0s)]
*  Was it difficult having him as both leading man and director? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=364.0s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=369.0s)]
*  I thought he flowed in and out of those two things effortlessly. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=370.0s)]
*  He never gets in the way. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=375.0s)]
*  I think that's a testament to him as an artist that his ego took a backseat to anything. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=378.0s)]
*  I think this is a role of a lifetime for her, and she bites down and she tears it up. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=386.0s)]
*  It's not easy for me to admit that I've been standing in the same place for 18 years. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=392.0s)]
*  Well, I've been standing with you. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=397.0s)]
*  I've been right here with you, Troy. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=399.0s)]
*  I got a life, too. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=402.0s)]
*  I gave 18 years of my life to stand in the same spot as you. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=404.0s)]
*  Don't you think I ever wanted other things? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=408.0s)]
*  Don't you think I had dreams and hopes? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=410.0s)]
*  What about my life? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=412.0s)]
*  What about me? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=413.0s)]
*  People say everything in film is small. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=414.0s)]
*  Every moment is small. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=418.0s)]
*  You gotta play it small. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=419.0s)]
*  And sometimes moments are not small. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=421.0s)]
*  It's painful to watch. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=424.0s)]
*  Well, it should be. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=426.0s)]
*  Because that's just how August wrote. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=428.0s)]
*  He didn't write small. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=432.0s)]
*  August Wilson's themes are big and universal. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=434.0s)]
*  His plays chronicle the struggles of Black Americans searching for what everyone wants. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=438.0s)]
*  Dignity, love, security across generations and in the face of overwhelming odds. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=443.0s)]
*  His genius was capturing the sensibilities, the unique cadences of African American life [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=449.0s)]
*  with finely crafted language. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=455.0s)]
*  There's a line, I said, what that mean to me, Body working? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=457.0s)]
*  What that mean to me, body working? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=460.0s)]
*  I don't care if she working. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=461.0s)]
*  Go ask her for $10 if she working. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=462.0s)]
*  Talking about body working. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=464.0s)]
*  Why ain't you working? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=466.0s)]
*  There's a rhythm to it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=467.0s)]
*  Not what does that mean to me, he wrote, what that mean to me. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=470.0s)]
*  What that mean to me, body working. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=475.0s)]
*  I don't care if she working. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=476.0s)]
*  Go ask her for $10 if she working. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=477.0s)]
*  Talking about body working. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=478.0s)]
*  Why haven't you working? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=480.0s)]
*  It's like Shakespeare. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=481.0s)]
*  The punchline is actually set up if you just play the music. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=482.0s)]
*  At a scoring session, we found Washington putting music to Wilson's words. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=485.0s)]
*  It's all part of being the director, which he's done twice before. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=493.0s)]
*  So we can just pick it up at 37. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=497.0s)]
*  I just dig the process. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=500.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=502.0s)]
*  Tastes like today, man. It don't get no better than this. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=503.0s)]
*  And in theory, I'm the boss. Don't tell anybody. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=505.0s)]
*  Like, oh, really? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=508.0s)]
*  August Wilson wanted to have a black director to make the film. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=510.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, he got his wish. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=515.0s)]
*  He got his wish. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=516.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=517.0s)]
*  There's no pressure on me because the last I checked, I was black. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=518.0s)]
*  I am black, so... [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=521.0s)]
*  Check. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=522.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I covered that. Yeah. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=523.0s)]
*  I didn't have to audition. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=525.0s)]
*  He said he didn't think a white director would be able to give justice. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=529.0s)]
*  It's called... I think it's a cultural thing, more than a race thing. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=536.0s)]
*  And culturally, you understand... [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=539.0s)]
*  Oh, no question. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=541.0s)]
*  You understand this place and these people. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=542.0s)]
*  No question. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=544.0s)]
*  When we would come out and pour in a little for the boys upstate, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=545.0s)]
*  I mean, I grew up with that. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=548.0s)]
*  We always poured out a little liquor for the guys that were locked up [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=550.0s)]
*  or the guys that were dead. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=553.0s)]
*  I know what it smells like when my sister's getting her hair fried [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=554.0s)]
*  with an iron, hot iron on a Sunday morning. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=557.0s)]
*  Thank you. You see what I'm saying? That's culture. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=560.0s)]
*  That's not even race. That's culture. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=562.0s)]
*  Denzel Washington grew up in Mount Vernon, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=564.0s)]
*  a working-class suburb of New York City. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=567.0s)]
*  His mother owned a beauty salon. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=569.0s)]
*  To keep him off the streets, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=571.0s)]
*  she scraped together the money to send him to boarding school. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=573.0s)]
*  He went to Fordham University and began acting in plays. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=577.0s)]
*  Hollywood took notice. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=580.0s)]
*  I did a TV movie in 1978 called Flesh and Blood. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=582.0s)]
*  We filmed here. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=588.0s)]
*  You're gonna be a heavyweight. You got the chin, you got the guts. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=589.0s)]
*  But most of all, Bobby, most of all, my blue-eyed friend, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=593.0s)]
*  most of all, you're white. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=597.0s)]
*  It may surprise you, but I saw that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=598.0s)]
*  Flesh and blood? Uh-huh. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=600.0s)]
*  And, um... [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=602.0s)]
*  Had a gap in my teeth then. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=604.0s)]
*  You had a gap in your teeth? And broken teeth. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=606.0s)]
*  And your voice was a little higher. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=608.0s)]
*  He went on to win his first Oscar for his role in the Civil War drama, Glory, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=610.0s)]
*  playing a defiant Union soldier in one of the first black regiments. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=617.0s)]
*  Watching him in Glory... [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=621.0s)]
*  I can't express what it means to an actor to see a performance like that [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=625.0s)]
*  because it was brave. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=631.0s)]
*  Who would have made a choice as they're getting beaten [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=639.0s)]
*  to play both bravery and pain at the same time? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=643.0s)]
*  Moments like that inspire you as an artist to go there also. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=649.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm so surprised! [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=655.0s)]
*  He is known in Hollywood for his almost obsessive preparation and attention to detail. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=657.0s)]
*  He says it helps him disappear into his roles. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=662.0s)]
*  Malcolm X, he kind of looked like him. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=666.0s)]
*  Actually, I don't. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=668.0s)]
*  I know you don't, but in the movie you convince people that you look like Malcolm X. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=669.0s)]
*  When you have a powder keg and there's too many sparks around it, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=673.0s)]
*  the thing's going to explode. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=676.0s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=678.0s)]
*  That's what you do. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=679.0s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=680.0s)]
*  And with Ruben Hurricane Carter, I understand you train with boxing. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=681.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=684.0s)]
*  In a movie, the shots have to be short and you have to fake it and do all that kind of stuff. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=685.0s)]
*  Oh, you were faking it? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=689.0s)]
*  Not the body shots. All the body shots were real. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=690.0s)]
*  So you were getting punched? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=693.0s)]
*  And I was punching. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=694.0s)]
*  Doesn't hurt as long as you're getting a few shots off. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=695.0s)]
*  Training day. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=700.0s)]
*  Today's a training day, Officer Hoyt. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=701.0s)]
*  I did a lot of work with the LAPD. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=703.0s)]
*  I found out how dangerous it was. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=705.0s)]
*  You got today and today only to show me who and what you're made of. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=707.0s)]
*  You hear me? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=710.0s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=711.0s)]
*  My nigga. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=713.0s)]
*  He was tough. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=715.0s)]
*  Alonzo was just wicked, just evil. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=716.0s)]
*  You hear often that black actors, black movies don't play well overseas. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=719.0s)]
*  Is that the truth or is that an excuse? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=727.0s)]
*  I've heard everything. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=731.0s)]
*  And what I hear keeps changing. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=734.0s)]
*  Because they used to say it didn't sell over here. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=736.0s)]
*  Then it does. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=739.0s)]
*  Then they say it doesn't sell in the south. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=740.0s)]
*  Then it does. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=743.0s)]
*  Well, it doesn't sell in Europe. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=744.0s)]
*  Then it does. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=746.0s)]
*  So I just keep pushing. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=747.0s)]
*  Well, what an opportunity I have to prove them wrong. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=749.0s)]
*  And he has. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=753.0s)]
*  Becoming one of Hollywood's most bankable stars, he's favored to get a seventh Oscar nomination for Fences. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=754.0s)]
*  This is all happening at a time when the Oscars are being criticized for lack of diversity. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=761.0s)]
*  I'm just wondering, what do you think about that? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=766.0s)]
*  I don't have to think about it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=768.0s)]
*  I've lived it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=770.0s)]
*  I've been the guy at the Oscars without my name being called. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=771.0s)]
*  I've been the guy at the Oscars when my name is called. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=775.0s)]
*  I've been the guy at the Oscars when everybody thought they was going to call my name and they didn't. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=778.0s)]
*  I've lived it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=782.0s)]
*  So what would you say to the people who are looking at this process and saying it's unfair? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=783.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=789.0s)]
*  And so what? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=790.0s)]
*  You give up? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=791.0s)]
*  If you're looking for an excuse, you will find one. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=793.0s)]
*  In race. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=796.0s)]
*  You can find it wherever you like. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=797.0s)]
*  You can't live like that. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=799.0s)]
*  Just do the best you can do. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=801.0s)]
*  So what's next? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=802.0s)]
*  I mean, are you enjoying this directing? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=803.0s)]
*  I won't be directing anytime soon. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=805.0s)]
*  You will not be? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=807.0s)]
*  No. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=808.0s)]
*  No. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=809.0s)]
*  Going back to the acting? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=810.0s)]
*  What's your first name? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=812.0s)]
*  Bill. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=813.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=814.0s)]
*  Put an S on it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=815.0s)]
*  Got to pay a couple of them. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=816.0s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=817.0s)]
*  Acting pays the bills. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=818.0s)]
*  Acting pays the bills. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=819.0s)]
*  Do what you got to do so that you can do what you want to do. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=820.0s)]
*  I've just done what I wanted to do. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=825.0s)]
*  Now I got to get back to what I got to do. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=827.0s)]
*  In Britain, they honor their distinguished actors with royal titles. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=838.0s)]
*  Lord Olivier, Dame Helen Mirren. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=843.0s)]
*  The best we can do is nominate them for Oscars, an annual hyped up competition for a glossy little statue. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=846.0s)]
*  If we did have a royal list, the name of Meryl Streep would surely be at the very top. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=853.0s)]
*  She's won two Oscars, been nominated a record 16 times, and doubtless will be again for a new film [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=859.0s)]
*  about one of the most controversial political figures of the 20th century, Margaret Thatcher, in life and on film. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=867.0s)]
*  The Iron Lady. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=875.0s)]
*  This is a day to put differences aside. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=877.0s)]
*  To hold one's head high. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=882.0s)]
*  And take pride in being British! [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=885.0s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=889.0s)]
*  Ms. Streep has a unique gift for not just portraying her character, but literally becoming her. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=890.0s)]
*  On the stage of the Delacorte Theater in New York Central Park, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=897.0s)]
*  where she first starred 35 years ago, I asked how real it seems to her while she's performing. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=901.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not insane. I do know that I'm acting. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=909.0s)]
*  But you forget about it, yeah. You kind of, you know, when you're doing it right, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=913.0s)]
*  there's a thrilling suspension of the day to day, and you're in someone else's head. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=919.0s)]
*  On this day, in a London film studio, that someone else is Margaret Thatcher, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=929.0s)]
*  dancing with a make-believe Ronald Reagan, Thatcher's fellow Cold Warrior. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=936.0s)]
*  There you go again. Why not? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=942.0s)]
*  It's the latest tour de force from Streep, a woman of many faces. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=944.0s)]
*  Sophie in Sophie's Choice. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=949.0s)]
*  As Julia Child. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=952.0s)]
*  Ta-da! [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=954.0s)]
*  As the French Lieutenant's woman. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=955.0s)]
*  As the devil wearing Prada. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=958.0s)]
*  Worrying about our careers, are we? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=960.0s)]
*  And now, the Iron Lady. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=963.0s)]
*  We can restore the health of the British economy, and we will do just that. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=966.0s)]
*  What particularly attracted you to the Margaret Thatcher role? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=971.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=975.0s)]
*  Just the opportunity to deal with the deep, buried discomfort that people still have, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=977.0s)]
*  men and women, with women in leadership positions. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=986.0s)]
*  As British Prime Minister, Thatcher strode the world stage for more than a decade. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=991.0s)]
*  The Iron Lady of the Western World. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=996.0s)]
*  Leaving heel prints on the backs of her own conservative party's Old Boys Club. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1000.0s)]
*  Did you like her? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1006.0s)]
*  I am in awe of what she did. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1008.0s)]
*  The policies you can argue with, but to sit in the hot seat, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1012.0s)]
*  I can't even imagine having that steadfastness. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1016.0s)]
*  I'll just have a small one, because I'm walking my figure. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1023.0s)]
*  Their stories are both about transformation. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1027.0s)]
*  The actress transforming herself into the politician who transformed herself [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1030.0s)]
*  to outthink, outwork and outwit the men around her. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1036.0s)]
*  Oh! [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1041.0s)]
*  One of the things she did was get a drama teacher to tell her how to support her voice. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1043.0s)]
*  Breathing in and... [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1049.0s)]
*  Dennis! [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1051.0s)]
*  Because her voice was sort of lighter, like mine is. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1052.0s)]
*  And they taught her to support it and bring it up from the depths of her place [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1057.0s)]
*  where the conviction lies and to carry it through without a breath until the end of the thought. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1066.0s)]
*  And then not to give him a chance to interrupt her. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1071.0s)]
*  She was also, lover or hater, remarkably single-minded [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1074.0s)]
*  and confident that her way was the only way. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1079.0s)]
*  Yes. I have a lot of that. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1082.0s)]
*  It was typecasting, was it? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1089.0s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1091.0s)]
*  At age 62, Meryl Streep is still at the top of her game, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1093.0s)]
*  one of the recipients at this year's Kennedy Center Honors. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1097.0s)]
*  That's her husband of 33 years, sculptor Don Gummer, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1101.0s)]
*  and their children, a son and three daughters, two of them actresses themselves. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1106.0s)]
*  There's something I want to show you. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1112.0s)]
*  On the theory that high school is destiny, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1115.0s)]
*  we took her back to the days long before she became Meryl of the movies. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1117.0s)]
*  Oh, this is my high school yearbook picture. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1122.0s)]
*  Back then in Bernardville, New Jersey, she was just plain Meryl Louise Streep. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1126.0s)]
*  Well, not so plain. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1131.0s)]
*  Pretty, blonde, vivacious cheerleader, our homecoming queen, where the boys are. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1134.0s)]
*  Where the boys are, indeed. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1140.0s)]
*  Oh, God. Bernardian art editor, that's what I was, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1142.0s)]
*  and the morning announcer, Diane Sawyer, eat your heart out. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1145.0s)]
*  Home movies made it clear. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1150.0s)]
*  The camera loved her from an early age. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1152.0s)]
*  But the homecoming queen didn't care much for the movies of the day. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1155.0s)]
*  She was fascinated by the classics. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1159.0s)]
*  There was one channel that had older movies, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1162.0s)]
*  and I loved Carole Lombard, and I loved Kate Hepburn and Bette Davis. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1166.0s)]
*  And Barbara Stanwyck, I like girls with attitude, you know, moxie. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1172.0s)]
*  There's an old word. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1176.0s)]
*  Though she had dabbled in acting, she got serious about it at the Yale Drama School. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1178.0s)]
*  That led to an audition with the public theater director, Joe Papp. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1183.0s)]
*  Joe Papp could be a taskmaster, yes? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1188.0s)]
*  Not to me. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1192.0s)]
*  Papp gave her her first break on Broadway, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1194.0s)]
*  a small role in a period piece called Trelawney of the Wells. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1199.0s)]
*  Joe Papp asked you if you could do a southern accent? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1204.0s)]
*  Yes, and he said, wait, try, do this southern. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1207.0s)]
*  Can you do a southern accent? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1212.0s)]
*  I'm from, not even southern New Jersey, you know. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1215.0s)]
*  I pulled it up out of probably some 4 o'clock movie somewhere. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1220.0s)]
*  I heard it was from the Diana Shore show. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1224.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, maybe that was it. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1227.0s)]
*  See the USA in your Chevrolet. Remember that? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1229.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1236.0s)]
*  Oh, God, wasn't she divine. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1237.0s)]
*  Here's where I forgot my lines in the seagull. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1239.0s)]
*  Soon she was doing the classics on this outdoor stage, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1242.0s)]
*  competing with airplanes, heat, rain and more. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1246.0s)]
*  Ducks. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1251.0s)]
*  Her career took off so fast that one summer she did Taming of the Shrew here at night [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1254.0s)]
*  and during the day shot two movies, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1260.0s)]
*  Kramer vs. Kramer and Woody Allen's Manhattan. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1264.0s)]
*  She was well on her way. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1268.0s)]
*  Are you writing a book about our marriage? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1271.0s)]
*  You leave me alone. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1273.0s)]
*  Her range was astonishing. One year a Texan, Karen Silkwood. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1275.0s)]
*  Let's not fight. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1279.0s)]
*  The next Danish in Out of Africa. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1281.0s)]
*  Roy has asked me for a divorce. He found someone that he wants to marry. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1284.0s)]
*  She wore spandex for Mamma Mia, a nun's habit for doubt [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1288.0s)]
*  and a beard playing a rabbi in Angels in America. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1295.0s)]
*  It always really bothers me when people imagine that characters that don't look like you [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1301.0s)]
*  or have the same accent as you do are far from you. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1310.0s)]
*  The great actress Sybil Thorndyke said, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1315.0s)]
*  I think we all have the germ of every other person inside of us. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1318.0s)]
*  And I think we do. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1323.0s)]
*  How are you feeling? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1325.0s)]
*  Margaret Thatcher is 86 now. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1327.0s)]
*  Her daughter Carol has written openly about her mother's slide into the darkness of dementia. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1330.0s)]
*  The film tackles the issue head on. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1336.0s)]
*  Did you have any concerns about showing this once remarkably vital woman having lost it all? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1339.0s)]
*  Well, that was the part that most intrigued me. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1346.0s)]
*  First of all, I don't feel there's any shame in dementia and people that suffer it. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1352.0s)]
*  And you're not prime minister anymore. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1361.0s)]
*  To tell an honest story about a big life in its ebb, you have to deal with this part of it. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1364.0s)]
*  There's one observation that gets her back up when people note that she's played a lot of strong-minded women. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1374.0s)]
*  No one has ever asked an actor, you're playing a strong-minded man. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1381.0s)]
*  We assume that men are strong-minded or have opinions, but a strong-minded woman is a different animal. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1386.0s)]
*  She's the public face of a movement to build a national women's history museum in Washington. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1395.0s)]
*  Margaret Thatcher said, if you want something spoken about, ask a man. If you want it done, ask a woman. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1402.0s)]
*  The museum near the National Mall would showcase little-known stories about women in America. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1412.0s)]
*  Wandering the Massachusetts countryside not far from her home, she insisted on taking us to the scene of one such story. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1421.0s)]
*  Clearing the brush so our camera crews wouldn't trip. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1431.0s)]
*  Look in that window. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1435.0s)]
*  It's the house where in 1781 a slave called Mum Bet intervened when a young slave girl was threatened by the lady of the house. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1436.0s)]
*  And she took a red-hot fireplace shovel and tried to strike the child and Mum Bet saved the little girl and burned her arm all the way up the arm. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1446.0s)]
*  And that was the last straw she... [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1459.0s)]
*  Mum Bet sued in court and gained her freedom, taking the new name Elizabeth Freeman. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1461.0s)]
*  The case led to the abolition of slavery in the state. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1468.0s)]
*  By 1790 the census recorded no enslaved people in Massachusetts. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1472.0s)]
*  As for women in Hollywood Street is an exception to the rule that most leading ladies have a short shelf life. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1477.0s)]
*  Four of her most recent films have been directed by women. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1486.0s)]
*  But one thing that drives her crazy is the snail's pace of moviemaking, shooting the same scene time and time again. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1490.0s)]
*  I don't like to go over things and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1499.0s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1509.0s)]
*  That happens a lot, though, doesn't it, in moviemaking? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1510.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I guess I have less tolerance for it. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1512.0s)]
*  I like movies that have little budget. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1515.0s)]
*  And so they can't do that. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1517.7s)]
*  Do you think that movies are better, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1518.9s)]
*  getting better than when you started? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1521.34s)]
*  I think the acting's better. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1523.64s)]
*  I think the acting is better than in the classic days, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1526.58s)]
*  frankly, of movies. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1529.7s)]
*  If you look at the movies being made, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1531.7s)]
*  the big movies that are being made are about comic strips. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1533.82s)]
*  Well, I don't see those. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1538.86s)]
*  Or vampires or gross behavior. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1539.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1542.62s)]
*  All aimed at, what, 18-year-old boys. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1544.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1547.5s)]
*  That's called the narrowing of the audience. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1548.34s)]
*  The movie business has worked assiduously to discourage you [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1550.56s)]

*  when the press held government to account. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1894.76s)]
*  Because the report on Senator McCarthy [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=1899.08s)]

*  and my dad would be able to read it on the teleprompter. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2215.98s)]

*  disinformation is one critical distinction. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2281.3799999999997s)]
*  Here's where I would tell you where we differ [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2284.3399999999997s)]
*  from what Murrow was doing. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2286.4599999999996s)]
*  Although McCarthy would try to pose things [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2288.42s)]
*  that he'd show up a blank piece of paper [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2290.36s)]
*  and say, I've got a list of names. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2292.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2293.36s)]
*  So that was his version of fake news. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2294.2000000000003s)]
*  We now are at a place where we've found [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2297.64s)]
*  that it's harder and harder and harder to discern the truth. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2300.64s)]
*  Facts are now negotiated. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2304.84s)]
*  You and I can agree or disagree, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2306.92s)]
*  but if we can't reach a consensus that this chair is brown, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2308.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2311.6800000000003s)]
*  We're in trouble. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2312.62s)]
*  That's right. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2313.46s)]
*  Can we turn the camera on and look at the opening shot? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2314.28s)]
*  By March, rehearsals had moved into the theater. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2316.52s)]
*  A big production issue on this day, the prop cigarettes. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2319.5s)]
*  Any trouble with cigarettes, lighters, ash trays, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2323.12s)]
*  anything like that? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2325.32s)]
*  We'll have to talk about ash trays. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2326.16s)]
*  The hardest part for me is smoking. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2328.06s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2330.02s)]
*  We smokes a lot and we smoke a lot in the play. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2330.86s)]
*  Everybody smokes in the play, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2333.06s)]
*  so the place is covered in smoke. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2334.06s)]
*  And smoking in our family is a big problem. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2335.86s)]
*  Grven could talk, a lot of tobacco farmers [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2340.3s)]
*  and almost all of my family members died of lung cancer. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2342.7s)]
*  My father's sister, Rosemary died of it. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2347.48s)]
*  She was a wonderful singer, died of it. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2348.8s)]
*  And my dad's 91 because he didn't smoke. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2350.6s)]
*  So smoking has always been a, it's a hard thing to do. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2353.08s)]
*  Set up an albuterol nebulizer. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2358.0s)]
*  Let's get a pulse ox right away. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2359.56s)]
*  It's easy to forget. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2361.26s)]
*  George Clooney has been an A-lister for 30 years now. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2362.44s)]
*  Usually he sleeps on the foot of my bed, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2366.4s)]
*  but he's gotten so fat. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2367.98s)]
*  In 2003, he was a bachelor living with a pet pig [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2369.34s)]
*  when 60 Minutes profiled him. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2372.8s)]
*  George, George, George! [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2374.86s)]
*  You were in the sexiest man of the year phase? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2377.06s)]
*  Sure, that was a big time for me. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2380.42s)]
*  Not that you're not sexy now. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2381.94s)]
*  It's okay, I'm not hurt now. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2383.26s)]
*  He's married now. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2384.78s)]
*  His wife and their two kids left the home they keep in Europe [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2385.98s)]
*  to spend this spring run with him in New York. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2389.34s)]
*  Clooney is also in a different phase of his life professionally. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2392.42s)]
*  Look, I'm 63 years old. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2396.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm not trying to compete with 25-year-olds leading men. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2398.02s)]
*  That's not my job. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2401.9s)]
*  I'm not doing romantic films anymore. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2403.28s)]
*  So we just put the catwalk in up here. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2405.76s)]
*  Opening night set for April 3rd, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2407.6800000000003s)]
*  George Clooney's turn on Broadway [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2409.88s)]
*  puts him a few feet from his audience. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2411.76s)]
*  They can see you. You can see them, too. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2414.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm not looking at them. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2415.88s)]
*  I'm putting my wife in the very, very, very back. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2417.6000000000004s)]
*  You wish you had done this earlier in your career? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2420.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't know that I could have. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2422.76s)]
*  I didn't do the work required to get there. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2424.28s)]
*  I saw the smile when you came out here [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2428.2400000000002s)]
*  and looked out here. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2430.1600000000003s)]
*  Anybody who would deny that would just be a liar. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2432.58s)]
*  I mean, there isn't a single actor alive [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2434.94s)]
*  that wouldn't have loved to have, you know, been on Broadway. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2436.86s)]
*  So that's the fun of it. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2439.46s)]
*  It's tricky the older you get, but why not? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2441.82s)]
*  And so the question is a very simple one. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2444.74s)]
*  Not what power unchecked will do. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2447.7799999999997s)]
*  We've seen that answer. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2450.14s)]
*  The question is, what are you prepared to do? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2452.5s)]
*  Good night and good luck. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2456.86s)]
*  Bob Dylan is not just a singing and songwriting legend. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2462.94s)]
*  He's one of the most enigmatic [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2466.98s)]
*  and reclusive musicians of our time. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2468.74s)]
*  Playing him in a movie based on his life [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2471.14s)]
*  would be a daunting task for any actor. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2473.5s)]
*  But when Timothée Chalamet was offered the role, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2475.86s)]
*  he was 23 and says he knew practically nothing about Dylan. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2478.0s)]
*  A lot of people told him not to do it, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2481.94s)]
*  but Chalamet likes a creative challenge. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2484.1s)]
*  The film, called A Complete Unknown, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2486.98s)]
*  came out in early May of 2000. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2488.94s)]
*  The film, called A Complete Unknown, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2490.96s)]
*  came out in December and received eight Oscar nominations, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2492.48s)]
*  including Timothée Chalamet's second best actor nod. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2496.08s)]
*  He's never met Bob Dylan, but because of the pandemic, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2499.4s)]
*  strikes in Hollywood, and other film commitments, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2502.2400000000002s)]
*  Chalamet ended up having about five years [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2504.92s)]
*  to study the man and his music, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2507.58s)]
*  determined like Bob Dylan was at his age to make it great. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2510.08s)]
*  I give 170% in everything. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2515.08s)]
*  I'm doing no but there. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2518.0s)]
*  I'm giving it my all. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2519.28s)]
*  Something like the Dylan Project, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2521.02s)]
*  these aren't watered down experiences. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2522.38s)]
*  I'm going Daniel Day-Lewis on all of them. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2524.98s)]
*  I'm not saying in process, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2527.3s)]
*  but I'm saying level of commitment. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2528.38s)]
*  And I don't know, man, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2530.0600000000004s)]
*  it sounds like I'm desperate saying that or something. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2531.98s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2533.7000000000003s)]
*  No, it sounds like you're a professional [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2534.5400000000004s)]
*  and you want it to be the best it can possibly be. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2535.36s)]
*  Yeah, and increasingly, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2537.02s)]
*  I don't wanna shy away from saying that. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2538.6600000000003s)]
*  I stumble on the side of 12 misty mountains. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2541.1800000000003s)]

*  didn't just need to figure out how to sing like Dylan. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2547.4s)]
*  He also learned how to play harmonica and guitar [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2550.2400000000002s)]
*  in about 40 Bob Dylan songs, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2553.12s)]
*  far more than were originally called for in the script. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2555.4s)]
*  It's a heartbreak, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2558.6400000000003s)]
*  it's gonna fall. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2562.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2565.78s)]

*  I was young when I left home, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2576.78s)]

*  Dylan was 19 when he arrived in New York from Minnesota. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2583.26s)]
*  A complete unknown, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2586.6600000000003s)]
*  he quickly became an icon in the world of folk music. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2587.98s)]
*  How many roads must a man walk down [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2591.1800000000003s)]
*  before you call him a man? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2596.46s)]
*  Poetic and political, his songs spoke to the times. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2600.6200000000003s)]
*  And a young generation demanding change. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2605.06s)]
*  And the first one now will later be last [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2607.98s)]
*  for the times they are changing. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2611.54s)]

*  at a nightclub called Cafe Wah in Greenwich Village. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2619.34s)]
*  This was one of his, you know, jump points. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2622.5s)]
*  This was like really a place where you could just go play [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2624.22s)]
*  folk music in the 60s, early 60s. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2626.2799999999997s)]
*  And I went during the movie, during the production, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2628.5s)]
*  and it ain't the same. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2631.02s)]
*  What were they playing? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2631.86s)]
*  They were playing with Aerosmith covers and the ACDC, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2632.72s)]
*  and also worthy art. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2637.08s)]
*  But different. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2639.9199999999996s)]
*  Very different. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2640.7599999999998s)]
*  When Chalamet started researching Dylan, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2641.8799999999997s)]
*  he did what many millennials likely would. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2644.04s)]
*  He looked him up on YouTube. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2646.8799999999997s)]
*  He found this clip particularly insightful. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2650.8799999999997s)]
*  Dylan performing on stage with Joan Baez, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2653.22s)]
*  with whom he'd had a romantic relationship. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2655.9199999999996s)]
*  Now it ain't me, babe. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2662.7s)]
*  What I love about the It Ain't Me performance [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2665.6s)]
*  is how playful it is and what a laugh he's having. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2667.48s)]
*  He was the one, at least in the footnotes of history, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2670.52s)]
*  that wasn't particularly, let's say, faithful with Joan. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2672.56s)]
*  So I get it from his perspective [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2677.8599999999997s)]
*  that he's having such a laugh. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2679.2s)]
*  On YouTube now you can play things at .5 speed [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2680.72s)]
*  or .75 speed. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2683.24s)]
*  And that was when I really slowed down [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2684.8599999999997s)]
*  because it's fascinating the way Bob observes her [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2686.9199999999996s)]
*  and how he refuses eye contact in that video. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2691.76s)]
*  This is Chalamet's version, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2695.6200000000003s)]
*  with Monica Barbaro playing Joan Baez. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2697.42s)]
*  It ain't me, babe. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2699.94s)]
*  No, no, no, it ain't me, babe. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2703.1800000000003s)]
*  It ain't me you're looking for, babe. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2707.26s)]
*  You weren't trying to imitate Bob Dylan. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2711.6400000000003s)]
*  No, totally. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2712.98s)]
*  That was the tension for me in doing a biopic [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2713.82s)]
*  on somebody so beloved and so well known was, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2716.0600000000004s)]
*  all right, where does my heart and where does my soul [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2718.26s)]
*  fit into this, can it fit into this, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2720.6s)]
*  particularly with someone who is so masked. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2722.6s)]
*  I put myself in another place, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2725.08s)]
*  but I'm a stranger there. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2729.88s)]
*  To connect with what might be behind Dylan's mask, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2731.48s)]
*  Chalamet disconnected from his own life [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2734.2799999999997s)]
*  for the two and a half months of filming. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2736.64s)]
*  I ain't gonna waste no money. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2738.68s)]
*  Wouldn't use his cell phone or have visitors on set. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2741.56s)]
*  I never approached a character so intensely as Bob [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2744.84s)]
*  because I had such respect for the material [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2747.04s)]
*  and I knew I wouldn't be able to live with myself [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2748.44s)]
*  if I remember that I was lazy on a day [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2750.34s)]
*  where something went wrong. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2752.6600000000003s)]
*  Hey, I'm talking so loud. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2753.9s)]
*  Chalamet pre-recorded all the Dylan songs [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2757.3s)]
*  he'd sing in the movie. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2759.82s)]
*  They were supposed to be played back on set during filming. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2761.1s)]
*  But it always sounded too clean. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2764.94s)]
*  The recording equipment's too clean now. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2766.52s)]
*  The guitars are too good. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2767.9s)]
*  Bob Dylan was drinking two bottles of red wine a day, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2770.2200000000003s)]
*  sometimes smoking 30 packs of cigarettes. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2772.26s)]
*  Did you drink two bottles of wine [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2773.86s)]
*  and smoke 30 packs of that and like it? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2775.26s)]
*  The smoking I did, the wine I held back [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2776.7400000000002s)]
*  was on more. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2779.18s)]
*  So Chalamet decided he wanted to try and sing [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2780.56s)]
*  and play live instead. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2783.2s)]
*  This scene was the first time he did it. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2785.48s)]
*  Dylan's just arrived in New York [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2787.7999999999997s)]
*  and visits his terminally ill hero, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2789.56s)]
*  folk music legend Woody Guthrie, played by Scoot McNary. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2791.64s)]
*  Edward Norton is Pete Seeger. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2795.68s)]
*  On his first take, director James Mangold [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2797.7599999999998s)]
*  knew Chalamet nailed it. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2800.44s)]
*  Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2802.68s)]
*  There's a moment in that scene [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2807.08s)]
*  right at the last stanza where he holds a note. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2809.9s)]
*  Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2812.74s)]
*  It come. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2816.2799999999997s)]
*  That would never have happened if we'd used [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2823.5s)]
*  the playback track. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2824.98s)]
*  Was that in the song originally? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2826.02s)]
*  Because I mean, there was. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2827.7s)]
*  No. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2829.2599999999998s)]
*  The dust and the gun with the wind. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2834.1s)]
*  He just did it. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2837.22s)]
*  What I see Timmy executing in the scene [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2838.28s)]
*  is the growth of confidence within the song. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2841.84s)]
*  So by the end of the song, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2845.0400000000004s)]
*  not only is he finishing it looking right at Woody, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2846.4s)]
*  but he's also holding it, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2849.7200000000003s)]
*  which is like what a grand diva would do in the spotlight. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2852.46s)]
*  You can't tell someone to do that. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2855.84s)]
*  I'm not even sure Timmy completely plans it intellectually. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2858.82s)]
*  That is that kind of talent. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2864.1200000000003s)]
*  Did you know you were gonna do that? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2868.98s)]
*  Was that a planned thing? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2869.8199999999997s)]
*  No, and it would be disingenuous to my, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2870.64s)]
*  you know, the way I like to act or my approach to stuff. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2874.14s)]
*  You don't have any clue why you did it? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2876.5s)]
*  No, I think it just happened, yeah, truly. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2877.66s)]
*  That may be true or it may not. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2885.14s)]
*  Like Dylan, Chalamet is reluctant to talk about [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2888.3399999999997s)]
*  how he does what he does. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2891.18s)]
*  If there's magic in acting, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2893.42s)]
*  Timothee Chalamet doesn't wanna give it all away. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2895.3s)]
*  What's the concern about revealing the magic? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2898.3s)]
*  It's nobody's business how I go about these things. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2900.98s)]
*  It's within the law. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2903.5800000000004s)]
*  And, uh. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2904.78s)]
*  It's within the law. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2905.78s)]
*  Yeah, and otherwise, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2906.78s)]
*  it might not be as interesting as people think [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2908.86s)]
*  or it could be a lot more interesting than people think. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2910.82s)]
*  It might be more interesting than what I'm doing. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2912.7000000000003s)]
*  She's our friend. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2914.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm her friend. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2915.2000000000003s)]
*  What Chalamet's done in nearly two dozen films [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2916.0600000000004s)]
*  has been plenty interesting. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2918.7000000000003s)]
*  In the Dune series, he transformed himself [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2920.5s)]
*  from the privileged son of a duke [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2922.78s)]
*  into a menacing messiah. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2924.7s)]
*  I am Paul Mardiva Trades, duke of Arrakis. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2926.3799999999997s)]
*  It's no use, Joe. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2930.7s)]
*  Joe, we've gotta have it out. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2931.8599999999997s)]
*  I have loved you ever since I've known you, Joe. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2933.2999999999997s)]
*  He's played Lori in Little Women [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2935.5s)]
*  and a love-struck teenager in Call Me By Your Name. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2937.46s)]
*  Ah, where'd you learn to do that? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2940.58s)]
*  I got nothing to offer but my chocolate. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2942.46s)]
*  He took a risk reinventing Willy Wonka. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2946.7799999999997s)]
*  This is your home. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2949.2599999999998s)]
*  A world of your own. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2952.62s)]
*  And his shape shifted between an adult drug addict [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2955.52s)]
*  and a reluctant King Henry V. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2958.44s)]
*  So you basically grew up in the theater district? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2960.64s)]
*  Yes, this is... [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2962.88s)]
*  As a child, Chalamet didn't dream of becoming an actor, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2963.72s)]
*  though he was surrounded by them. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2966.52s)]
*  He lived in this rent-subsidized apartment complex [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2968.52s)]
*  in Manhattan full of artists. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2971.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, Izzy. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2973.12s)]
*  How you doing, man? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2974.92s)]
*  What are you doing here? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2975.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2976.58s)]
*  Doing a little interview, baby. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2977.42s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2978.2599999999998s)]
*  Growing up in this building, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2979.08s)]
*  certainly seems to have made an impression. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2981.1s)]
*  This building truthfully made me scared of acting [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2983.2999999999997s)]
*  because it's a tough lifestyle [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2985.8199999999997s)]
*  and a lot of people aren't doing... [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2988.8599999999997s)]
*  It's a hard way to put it. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2992.06s)]
*  It's a hard way to put it. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2992.8999999999996s)]
*  You would think growing up here, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2994.1s)]
*  it would encourage you to be an actor, but actually... [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2996.06s)]
*  No, it actually terrified me of becoming an actor. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=2997.2599999999998s)]
*  His mom, Nicole Flender, was a dancer [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3000.2999999999997s)]
*  and works with the Actors' Equity Association. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3002.62s)]
*  His sister, Pauline Chalamet, is an actress [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3005.42s)]
*  and Timmy, as his friends and family call him, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3008.16s)]
*  booked occasional acting jobs as a child, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3010.7999999999997s)]
*  though he told us he really wanted [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3013.4s)]
*  to be a professional soccer player. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3014.8399999999997s)]
*  This is him on Law and Order when he was 12. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3017.2s)]
*  Could you please not tell mom and dad [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3020.1s)]
*  about us playing Xbox? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3021.36s)]
*  But his father, Marc Chalamet, a French journalist, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3022.94s)]
*  wasn't exactly pushing him to act. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3025.6s)]
*  My dad, I think he very, very, very correctly, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3027.7599999999998s)]
*  rightfully was wary growing up. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3031.0s)]
*  It's no place for a child. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3033.24s)]
*  It really isn't. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3035.0s)]
*  The cameras and people going, hey, do the thing [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3036.82s)]
*  where we recognize you as cute in your own head. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3039.1000000000004s)]
*  I think my dad was more just like, be normal. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3041.96s)]
*  These days, that's easier said than done. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3044.1600000000003s)]
*  I appreciate it, man. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3048.7000000000003s)]
*  When we went to get a slice of pizza, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3050.0600000000004s)]
*  he told us a turning point in his life [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3051.6600000000003s)]
*  was getting into LaGuardia High School, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3053.82s)]
*  a famously competitive public school [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3056.0600000000004s)]
*  for the performing arts. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3058.1600000000003s)]
*  It's a school that champions the arts, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3059.6000000000004s)]
*  so there I doubled down. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3062.0600000000004s)]
*  I was not a distracted kid as a teenager, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3063.36s)]
*  like maybe to a fault. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3065.26s)]
*  I wasn't partying or, I don't say that [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3066.46s)]
*  to come off straight-laced, like to a fault. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3068.5600000000004s)]
*  I was very focused and driven. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3071.1000000000004s)]
*  He was cast as the lead in school musicals. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3076.0600000000004s)]
*  I'm the bravest individual I have ever met. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3078.6600000000003s)]
*  And developed routines for LaGuardia's talent show [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3085.86s)]
*  as a rapper named Lil Timmy Tim. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3088.2200000000003s)]
*  It's just humiliating, but I'll show you guys. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3090.8s)]
*  He took us to the practice room in his building's basement [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3092.8s)]
*  where he'd rehearse. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3095.7000000000003s)]
*  How old were you there? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3097.1000000000004s)]
*  Here I'm 15, but I look like I'm seven. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3098.2000000000003s)]
*  These are two good friends of mine, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3100.6000000000004s)]
*  Sheree and Desiree. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3101.8s)]
*  They're the only people in the world [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3102.9s)]
*  that did this talent show actively. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3104.4s)]
*  I probably asked 35 people. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3106.7000000000003s)]
*  He did go to college, Columbia University for a year, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3109.1000000000004s)]
*  and then some classes at New York University. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3112.4s)]
*  But he dropped out, wanting to focus on acting full-time. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3115.0s)]
*  Listen, man, I was struggling. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3118.7999999999997s)]
*  I was struggling. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3121.7999999999997s)]
*  I was struggling with identity, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3123.7999999999997s)]
*  and I was struggling with your sense of self-respect, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3125.0s)]
*  your sense of drive or where you want to be pales [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3128.2s)]
*  in comparison to where you are. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3134.2s)]
*  Call Me By Your Name changed everything. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3136.7999999999997s)]
*  He was 21 when it came out. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3139.2999999999997s)]
*  Around the same age, Bob Dylan was [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3141.2s)]
*  when his career started to take off. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3143.0s)]
*  Chalamet became the youngest person [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3146.0s)]
*  nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3147.4s)]
*  in nearly 80 years. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3150.4s)]
*  We thought he'd relate to something Bob Dylan said [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3152.6000000000004s)]
*  about the meaning of destiny to Ed Bradley [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3155.4s)]
*  in a rare interview on 60 Minutes more than 20 years ago. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3158.0s)]
*  It's a feeling you have that you know something about yourself [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3161.8s)]
*  nobody else does. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3165.8s)]
*  The picture you have in your mind of what you're about [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3167.8s)]
*  will come back to you. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3171.6000000000004s)]
*  What you're about will come true. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3173.8s)]
*  That's kind of a thing you kind of have to keep to your own self [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3177.2000000000003s)]
*  because it's a fragile feeling, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3180.4s)]
*  and you put it out there, somebody will kill it. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3182.2000000000003s)]
*  So it's best to keep that all inside. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3184.2000000000003s)]
*  Man, wow. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3189.2000000000003s)]
*  You watch this interview a lot. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3190.8s)]
*  Yeah, probably a thousand times, yeah. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3192.0s)]
*  I always loved what he said about self-destiny being fragile. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3194.8s)]
*  You believe that too, that if... [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3197.6000000000004s)]
*  I believe that especially early on in life and your career [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3199.4s)]
*  when you're in your early 20s or late teens, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3202.2s)]
*  and if you can find a way to keep it quiet [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3204.2s)]
*  but also have a lot of confidence, it's the best path, you know? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3206.3999999999996s)]
*  It's interesting to me that you still haven't met Bob Dylan. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3209.2s)]
*  No, no. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3211.6s)]
*  Is that weird to you? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3213.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's not, you know? [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3214.3999999999996s)]
*  He doesn't seem like he wants to be bothered by, not me, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3216.2s)]
*  but by everyone in the last 60, 70 years. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3218.3999999999996s)]
*  What would you say to him? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3220.7999999999997s)]
*  I would say thank you. I would just say thank you. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3221.7999999999997s)]
*  You know what? That's f***ed. I'm gonna take that back. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3224.2s)]
*  I wouldn't, you know, honestly, I would honestly just be like, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3226.0s)]
*  I would play it super cool, you know? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3230.6s)]
*  Because I feel like he's probably used to so much hyperbole and praise. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3232.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3236.2s)]
*  Maybe I would try to out... [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3237.2s)]
*  Out cool him? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3239.0s)]
*  Out bob him. Not cool, out bob him. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3239.6s)]
*  Yeah. Just like, strangely not bring anything up around him. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3241.6s)]
*  Not even mention that you did the movie. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3246.2s)]
*  Maybe just talk about like... [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3248.2s)]
*  The weather. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3249.2s)]
*  The weather and, you know, what his favorite sandwich is or something like that, yeah. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3249.7999999999997s)]
*  Jennifer Lawrence is one of the most popular, highly paid actresses in Hollywood. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3261.6s)]

*  She took an unconventional path to Hollywood. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3290.0s)]
*  A risky and surprising part of her story. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3293.4s)]
*  We found a young woman with a fiercely independent spirit. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3296.8s)]

*  I just knew. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3330.8s)]

*  She made three comedy dramas in as many years playing unforgettable, flawed, resilient women. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3358.8s)]
*  Tiffany, a young widow in Silver Linings' playbook. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3365.8s)]
*  You are not a stand-up guy right now. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3370.8s)]
*  If it's me reading the signs. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3372.8s)]
*  You're reading the signs? You're reading the signs? Oh, okay. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3374.8s)]
*  In American Hustle, she played Rosalyn, a loony Long Island housewife. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3379.8s)]
*  You fell in love. Don't you dare forget that part. We fell madly in love. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3386.8s)]
*  And in Joy, she was a desperate mother turned entrepreneur. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3391.8s)]
*  It's the only mop that you're ever going to buy. The best mop you're ever going to use. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3395.8s)]
*  She earned Academy Award nominations for all three movies. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3399.8s)]
*  I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3403.8s)]
*  And took home the Best Actress Oscar for Silver Linings' playbook. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3407.8s)]
*  Hey, Tiffany. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3411.8s)]
*  But Jennifer Lawrence is not one to rest on her laurels. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3412.8s)]
*  I am hard on myself. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3416.8s)]
*  Why? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3420.8s)]
*  I get paid a huge amount of money to be able to do what I love. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3421.8s)]
*  So you're the one putting this pressure on you. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3426.8s)]
*  Yes. Too many people sacrificed so that I could be here. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3429.8s)]
*  My parents, you know, changed their entire lives to support me. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3433.8s)]
*  And I worked too hard to get here to be stupid about it. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3437.8s)]
*  Lawrence's father owned a construction company. Her mother ran a summer camp. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3441.8s)]
*  She told us her two older brothers pretty much ignored their annoying little sister. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3446.8s)]
*  Did you used to play act when you were growing up? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3451.8s)]
*  Oh, yes. I was constantly performing. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3454.8s)]
*  We just didn't know that that meant I was an actor. I just thought, you know, I was a weirdo. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3457.8s)]
*  But I understand that you pretended to have a problem with your leg at school. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3461.8s)]
*  Who told you that? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3466.8s)]
*  Oh, we've got our sources. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3467.8s)]
*  In school I told everybody I had a wooden leg. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3469.8s)]
*  And I like walked in a very consistent lap. Like, incredibly consistent. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3472.8s)]
*  And when my mom came to get me from school, my teachers were like, it's awful. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3478.8s)]
*  What happened to Jennifer's leg? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3482.8s)]
*  And my mom was like, she does not. Her leg has not been amputated. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3485.8s)]
*  I used to just invent stories just to invent them. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3492.8s)]
*  She used zany antics to hide the fact she was a poor student, hyperactive, didn't fit in. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3496.8s)]
*  She could drive her parents crazy. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3502.8s)]
*  My parents were just, you know, they would go through periods of time where they just wanted me out of the house. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3505.8s)]
*  And it was called a lockout. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3511.8s)]
*  And so I'd go to the door and it was locked and I'd be like, all right, I got to find something else to do until my parents are ready to deal with me again. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3513.8s)]
*  You were a handful. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3520.8s)]
*  I was a handful. And I got it. We never fought about it. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3522.8s)]
*  I've always been very self-aware about my annoyingness. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3526.8s)]
*  She told us she felt lost in school and dreamed of becoming an actor. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3531.8s)]
*  At 14, she badgered her parents to visit New York, where improbably she was discovered by a modeling scout, then given some scripts to read. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3536.8s)]
*  I struggled through school. I never felt very smart. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3546.8s)]
*  And when I'm reading the script and I feel like I know exactly what it would look like if somebody felt that way, that was a whole part of my brain that I didn't even know existed, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3550.8s)]
*  something that I could be confident in. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3561.8s)]
*  And I didn't want to let it go. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3564.8s)]
*  What was it you wanted so much? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3567.8s)]
*  It's so hard to explain. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3570.8s)]
*  It was just an overwhelming feeling of I get this. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3572.8s)]
*  This is what I was meant to do and to get people to try to understand that when you're 14 years old, wanting to drop out of school and do this and your parents are just like you're out of your mind. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3575.8s)]
*  Did you finish up high school? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3585.8s)]
*  I dropped out of middle school. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3588.8s)]
*  I don't technically have a GED or a diploma. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3593.8s)]
*  I am self-educated. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3598.8s)]
*  Do you regret that? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3601.8s)]
*  No, I really don't. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3603.8s)]
*  I wanted to forge my own path. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3605.8s)]
*  I found what I wanted to do and I don't want anything getting in the way of it. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3607.8s)]
*  And even friends for many years were not as important to me as my career. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3611.8s)]
*  I mean, from the age of 14. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3614.8s)]
*  That stubborn determination landed her a role in a sitcom. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3616.8s)]
*  When her parents saw her happy and focused for the first time, they agreed to accompany her to Hollywood. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3620.8s)]
*  She never went back to school. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3627.8s)]
*  Spell house. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3629.8s)]
*  At 18, she wrangled the lead in a small, bleak independent film called Winter's Bone. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3631.8s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3638.8s)]
*  It was a breakout performance that earned her first Oscar nomination. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3641.8s)]
*  There's not a lot of dialogue, but yet your presence fills the screen. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3646.8s)]
*  It was really just feeling, believing, you know, in this situation, look at it through her eyes. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3652.8s)]
*  And then that's always going to come across in your eyes, in your face, in your body language. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3660.8s)]
*  That empathy, you can channel that into acting. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3665.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's how I act. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3669.8s)]
*  That's really my only tool, I think. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3671.8s)]
*  No acting training? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3674.8s)]
*  No. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3676.8s)]
*  It's just empathy. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3677.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3678.8s)]
*  Is that difficult or easy for you to do? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3679.8s)]
*  It's easy. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3682.8s)]
*  To just let go of Jennifer Lawrence? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3684.8s)]
*  Yeah, because that's when you get the high. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3686.8s)]
*  That's what I crave, that really getting lost into something, being almost possessed by another emotion. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3689.8s)]
*  That's the adrenaline rush, that's the high that I can't live without. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3697.8s)]
*  In her new movie, Red Sparrow, Lawrence stars as a Russian ballerina coerced into being a spy. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3702.8s)]
*  It calls for nudity, something she thought she'd never do after she was traumatized [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3709.8s)]
*  when her most private pictures were hacked in 2014 and spread across the Internet. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3715.8s)]
*  Well, you told us you didn't like doing movies with a lot of sex in them. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3721.8s)]
*  But Red Sparrow is all about sex. Why'd you change your mind? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3725.8s)]
*  I read this script that I'm dying to do, and the one thing that's getting in my way is nudity. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3729.8s)]
*  And I realized there's a difference between consent and not. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3736.8s)]
*  And I showed up for the first day and I did it, and I felt empowered. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3742.8s)]
*  I feel like something that was taken from me, I got back and amusing in my art. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3748.8s)]
*  And that hacking incident, did it just vaporize? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3753.8s)]
*  It didn't vaporize, but I did feel like I took the power out of having my body taken from me. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3760.8s)]
*  I felt like I took it back and I could almost own it again. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3779.8s)]
*  Are you worried that audiences won't see it the way you see it? [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3783.8s)]
*  I was, but it doesn't matter. It's my body and it's my art and it's my choice. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3788.8s)]
*  And if you don't like boobs, you should not go see Red Sparrow. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3792.8s)]
*  After making two movies a year since the age of 20, Lawrence is taking some time off. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3796.8s)]
*  Aha! My ho silver! [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3803.8s)]
*  She wanted to go fishing, something she's always found relaxing, so we found a trout lake in Anaheim. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3805.8s)]
*  Here, away from paparazzi and the pressures of celebrity, we found her playful and fully aware she's a 27-year-old in a high-wire act with the whole world watching. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3812.8s)]
*  It's problematic for you to go out into the public? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3825.8s)]
*  I just have to like prepare a little bit. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3828.8s)]
*  But it's always the one day that you look like crap, that a paparazzi just jumps out from behind a car and you're like, oh, it looked so cute yesterday. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3831.8s)]
*  Does the fame sort of lock you in? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3842.8s)]
*  It does, but like my favorite activity is sitting by the fire drinking wine with my girlfriends. That's why you're coming. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3844.8s)]
*  It's a girls night with Bill. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3850.8s)]
*  It's a girly girly night. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3851.8s)]
*  This is good. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3853.8s)]
*  She invited us over to meet her three closest friends, Laura, Justine and Lauren. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3854.8s)]
*  They've known her since long before she became a movie star, and she says they keep her sane. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3860.8s)]
*  So you're like her rock, her foundation? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3866.8s)]
*  We are her security guards. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3869.8s)]
*  I was going to say. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3871.8s)]
*  We're much more security. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3872.8s)]
*  Emotional security guards. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3874.8s)]
*  They tease her. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3876.8s)]
*  No, she cannot do that. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3878.8s)]
*  I told her the other day, I'm like, you know your classic dance moves. She got so mad at me, she said, I don't do that. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3879.8s)]
*  I don't dance like that. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3885.8s)]
*  And then she goes, wait a second. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3886.8s)]
*  This feels like home. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3887.8s)]
*  When Jennifer left the room, her friends conspired. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3889.8s)]
*  Should I bring him the self-portrait? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3893.8s)]
*  It was a masterpiece she'd painted at 16, a self-portrait. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3896.8s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3902.8s)]
*  No. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3904.8s)]
*  What is it? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3905.8s)]
*  What is it? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3906.8s)]
*  I did not know it was going to go that far. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3908.8s)]
*  I mean, that was, that was really bold. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3914.8s)]
*  I literally jumped over me to get to this picture. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3916.8s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3920.8s)]
*  God, talk about laughing therapy. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3921.8s)]
*  That seems to be kind of sinful to who you are. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3923.8s)]
*  Laughing? [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3927.8s)]
*  The laughing and the fun. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3928.8s)]
*  Oh, I've got to have it. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3929.8s)]
*  You've got to have it. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3930.8s)]
*  I've got to have it. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3931.8s)]
*  It's her defense against the brutal cutthroat side of show business, which has been on conspicuous display recently. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3932.8s)]
*  With shocking allegations of sexual harassment and assault, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3940.8s)]
*  Lawrence has added her voice to the Time's Up movement and spoke to us about Harvey Weinstein. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3943.8s)]
*  He produced her Oscar-winning movie, Silver Linings Playbook. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3949.8s)]
*  Was he ever inappropriate? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3954.8s)]
*  No, he was never inappropriate with me. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3955.8s)]
*  But what he did was criminal and deplorable. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3958.8s)]
*  And when it came out and I heard about it, I wanted to kill him. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3962.8s)]
*  The way that he destroyed so many women's lives, I want to see him in jail. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3969.8s)]
*  She was one of the first to speak out publicly about pay inequity in Hollywood. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3976.8s)]
*  When it got out three years ago that her male co-stars in American Hustle had been paid more than she had, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3982.8s)]
*  Lawrence wrote an essay blaming herself. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3988.8s)]
*  Why not blame the studio? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3992.8s)]
*  They're the ones who didn't pay you. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3993.8s)]
*  Because I didn't fight hard enough. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3995.8s)]
*  It was my own mentality that led me to believe that I didn't deserve to be paid equally. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=3997.8s)]
*  Would you do that again? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4004.8s)]
*  No. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4006.8s)]
*  You feel you know your worth now? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4008.8s)]
*  I feel I know my worth and I feel like I work to keep it that way. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4010.8s)]
*  Does that translate into money and power? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4013.8s)]
*  Yeah. I can work with directors who I've admired for a very long time and get a screenplay written. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4016.8s)]
*  I have an amazing career bill. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4023.8s)]
*  What you do? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4025.8s)]
*  There's a lot of risks too. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4027.8s)]
*  This is right now. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4029.8s)]
*  It's all very temporary. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4031.8s)]
*  Hollywood is very fickle. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4034.8s)]
*  What, you're like the flavor of the month? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4036.8s)]
*  I could be. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4039.8s)]
*  If the next few movies don't do well in the box office, I won't get paid the same. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4040.8s)]
*  That's the way it works. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4045.8s)]
*  If you can't prove that you deserve that number, then you're not going to get it. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4046.8s)]
*  So it's very fickle. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4050.8s)]
*  It's very fickle, so I don't want to sound like I'm on a high horse because I might be on a tiny little Shetland pony in a month. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4051.8s)]
*  Kate Winslet was just 20 years old when she was plucked from relative obscurity to star in Titanic. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4066.8s)]
*  She's had her pick of lead roles ever since. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4072.8s)]
*  Film critics we spoke to compare her to greats like Katharine Hepburn and Meryl Streep. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4075.8s)]
*  Winslet has a propensity for playing tough, angst-ridden women. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4080.8s)]
*  And that's exactly who she becomes in her latest film, Lee, which she also produced about American photographer Lee Miller, one of the few female journalists on the front lines of World War II. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4084.8s)]
*  We met Winslet last month at the theater where she performed as a teenager and found her to be remarkably un-Hollywood. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4096.8s)]
*  She drove herself to the interview, showed up alone, and dropped a few F-bombs. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4104.8s)]
*  Well, the idea of going back on this stage still terrifies me. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4110.8s)]
*  So how do you get over the nerves? What do you tell yourself? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4114.8s)]
*  Oh, honestly, it's a whole bunch of mind-f*****. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4117.8s)]
*  I mean, it is even to this day, like anything, going for a job interview. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4121.8s)]
*  It's absolutely terrifying if it's a job you really want, doubly terrifying. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4126.8s)]
*  You've said on the first day you walk in and think everyone is in here thinking, why did they cast her? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4130.8s)]
*  Yeah, that, oh my God. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4137.8s)]
*  You are an Oscar-winning actress. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4139.8s)]
*  So what? When I was doing Lee, I would sit there and I would say, this is ridiculous. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4142.8s)]
*  I can truly think of at least five other brilliant actresses who would have played this part much better than me, like a lot better. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4147.8s)]
*  And often I will turn to another crew member and I'll say, they just read the wrong name off the list. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4153.8s)]
*  I'm telling you, they didn't mean for me to be here. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4158.8s)]
*  And I will have days where... [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4161.8s)]
*  Meryl's coming out of the back door now to take your role. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4163.8s)]
*  Please. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4165.8s)]
*  Welcome. Come on in. Delighted to have you. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4166.8s)]
*  You must be Lee Miller. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4169.8s)]
*  Well, it's a war zone, Colonel. Just Lee is fine. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4171.8s)]
*  That role that caused Kate Winslet so much angst was for the movie Lee. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4175.8s)]
*  She didn't just star in it, she made it, her first as a producer. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4181.8s)]
*  How much time did you spend at this house? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4189.8s)]
*  Oh my God, I mean a lot of time across seven years, yeah. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4192.8s)]
*  Those years were spent at Lee Miller's estate in the English countryside where she lived with her husband, a British painter. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4198.8s)]
*  It's where, with the help of Miller's son, Winslet scoured the archives and decided to focus Miller's life story not on her history as a model who had many lovers. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4205.8s)]
*  We don't hire older models. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4216.8s)]
*  Don't blow a gasket. I'm not a model anymore. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4218.8s)]
*  But as a troubled woman who in her late 30s left her glamorous life to become a war photographer, capturing some of the most haunting images from World War II, including some of the first uses of napalm and Nazi concentration camps, Winslet says she knew it wouldn't be an easy sell. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4221.8s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about what some of those phone calls were like. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4240.8s)]
*  There was one potential investor who said to me, why should I like this woman? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4244.8s)]
*  I mean she's drunk, she's like loud. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4247.8s)]
*  I mean he just probably stopped short of saying she has wrinkles on her face. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4251.8s)]
*  You had a director say something like, I'll get your little Lee funded? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4257.8s)]
*  You want to share names now? [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4262.8s)]
*  Never, never, no. That's not my vibe. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4264.8s)]
*  No, but so this director did say, yeah, tell you what, if you be in my film, I'll help you get your little Lee Miller film made. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4267.8s)]
*  And he actually went like that. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4274.8s)]
*  And I was like, might just have lost signal. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4276.8s)]
*  She didn't make the movie with those men. Instead she insisted on bringing in a female director, co-producer and writers. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4280.8s)]
*  Winslet was intimately involved in every step of production, as we saw during a scoring session last spring. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4292.8s)]
*  Kate? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4304.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4305.8s)]
*  It doesn't feel too loud to you, does it? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4306.8s)]
*  Well it's funny. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4308.8s)]
*  Okay, it's too loud. Let's do it again. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4310.8s)]
*  She also enlisted a historian to make an exact replica of Miller's camera and really took pictures while she was acting. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4313.8s)]
*  Why did you feel like you had to learn this craft? It couldn't just be a prop. It needed to feel like an extension of my arms. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4321.8s)]
*  I had to be confident and comfortable with it. And in order to do that, I had to know what I was doing. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4330.8s)]
*  She spends months, even years, preparing for roles, inventing an elaborate backstory for every character, down to what sport they played in school and how they feel about their mothers. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4335.8s)]
*  You know me, I'm impulsive. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4346.8s)]
*  She's learned to dig for fossils, make dresses and free dive, holding her breath for more than seven minutes for Avatar 2. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4348.8s)]
*  And she's not afraid of being exposed. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4357.8s)]
*  Alright, make me invisible. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4361.8s)]
*  Because to see a Kate Winslet movie often means you'll see a lot of Kate Winslet. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4364.8s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4370.8s)]
*  And then there's the accents. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4372.8s)]
*  Yeah, Nershan, down at Easttown. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4375.8s)]
*  She won an Emmy for Mayor of Easttown, playing a vaping, beer-swinging detective, nailing the specific sound of Delaware County, a Philadelphia suburb. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4378.8s)]
*  She's probably lying at the bottom of the Delaware River right now. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4388.8s)]
*  And why is the Philly so hard? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4392.8s)]
*  It's actually the I sound in the Philadelphia, in the Delco dialect that is really difficult. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4394.8s)]
*  They don't say, that's nice. They say, that's nice. I like your bike. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4400.8s)]
*  And though she may seem like someone with a shelf full of Oscars, she won her first and only in 2009 for her portrayal of a Nazi prison guard in The Reader. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4407.8s)]
*  I want to take out a book. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4418.8s)]
*  For years she kept the statue in her bathroom so guests could hold it up in the mirror and pretend to win. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4420.8s)]
*  I used to get the bus into town a lot. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4427.8s)]
*  We went with Winslet to Reading, the working class town just outside London where she was born and raised. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4430.8s)]
*  This is the house? Oh my God, this is the house. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4436.8s)]
*  The front door boarded up. Her family no longer lives here. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4439.8s)]
*  I lived here until when I was sort of 16 and I kind of left home really when I was 16. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4443.8s)]
*  Winslet is the second of four children. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4449.8s)]
*  Her father was a struggling actor who often gave his daughter the advice she still lives by. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4452.8s)]
*  You're only as good as your last gig. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4457.8s)]
*  He would sort of hop from job to job and then he would do part-time work to make ends meet in the meantime. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4460.8s)]
*  But the thing that was interesting I think is that even though there was so little, as you can see, to go around, we were really happy. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4466.8s)]
*  With financial help from a charity for actors, she enrolled in a local theatre school when she was 11, catching the train into London for auditions. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4475.8s)]
*  She says the scrutiny of her appearance started young. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4484.8s)]
*  You once had a drama teacher tell you, settle for the fat girl parts? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4488.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. Now listen, Kate, I'm telling you darling, if you're going to look like this you'll have to settle for the fat girl parts. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4493.8s)]
*  And I wasn't even fat. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4502.8s)]
*  What did that do to your spirit? Your confidence? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4504.8s)]
*  It made me think, I'll just show you. Just quietly. It was like a sort of a quiet determination really. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4507.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'll just go in. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4515.8s)]
*  This grocery store was once the deli where 16-year-old Winslet was working when she got the news that she'd landed her first movie. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4517.8s)]
*  And I was making a sandwich and the phone rang and I swear to God there was something about the way the phone rang. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4524.8s)]
*  You knew? [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4530.8s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, that's for me. I wonder if it's about the job. And then the owner was like, hey, phone's for you. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4531.8s)]
*  I thought, oh my God. So I ran and was told that I'd gotten this part. And then I was just so unraveled I had to leave. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4537.8s)]
*  I was like, oh God, I have to go home and tell Mum and Dad. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4546.8s)]
*  After filming that first movie, Heavenly Creatures, Winslet went right back to making sandwiches. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4549.8s)]
*  That must have been kind of what is going on in my world here. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4555.8s)]
*  No, because that was what I knew. You know, my dad would do jobs and he'd go back to tar macking the roads or working as a postman. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4558.8s)]
*  So I just thought, oh, well, that's what you do as an actor. If you're lucky, you get a job and then you go back to a day job. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4565.8s)]
*  At 20, she got the offer for the part that would make Hollywood history. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4571.8s)]
*  Playing Rose opposite Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack in Titanic, the first film to break a billion dollars at the box office. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4579.8s)]
*  Winslet was game to discuss just about anything, but let's talk about Titanic. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4588.8s)]
*  Really? I was wondering what your reaction would be if I said that to you. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4594.8s)]
*  No, I'm happy to talk about Titanic. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4599.8s)]
*  I guess it wouldn't be an interview with you if we didn't talk about Titanic. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4601.8s)]
*  It could be an interview without it. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4605.8s)]
*  We tried to ask about the famous scene that has sparked decades of debates. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4607.8s)]
*  I'll never let go. I promise. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4612.8s)]
*  May I ask, true, Leo really could have fit on the raft? [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4616.8s)]
*  Do you know what? I have no idea. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4622.8s)]
*  Does it annoy you at all that 27 years later this movie still comes up in this way and probably will for the rest of your life? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4625.8s)]
*  No. I tell you, what I do sometimes find just curious, I suppose, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4633.8s)]
*  is whatever I say about Titanic will often be the take home. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4640.8s)]
*  So I just think, well, there were those things that I said about the film I was talking about, and yet that's the one thing. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4645.8s)]
*  So that's the only thing that sometimes I just think. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4651.8s)]
*  Where to, miss? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4655.8s)]
*  To the stars. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4659.8s)]
*  While Titanic made Winslet a star, she says it came at a cost. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4660.8s)]
*  Paparazzi aggressively pursued her and just listened to how she was ridiculed for her weight. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4665.8s)]
*  Kate's a little melted and poured into that dress, and you know, she just needed two sizes large and it would probably have been okay. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4671.8s)]
*  I gasped at how cruel some of that coverage was of you at that time. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4677.8s)]
*  I know. It's absolutely appalling. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4682.8s)]
*  What kind of a person must they be to do something like that to a young actress who's just trying to figure it out? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4687.8s)]
*  Did you ever get face to face with any of those people? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4695.8s)]
*  I did get face to face. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4698.8s)]
*  What did you say? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4700.8s)]
*  I let them have it. I said, I hope this haunts you. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4701.8s)]
*  It was a great moment. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4705.8s)]
*  It was a great moment because it wasn't just for me. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4714.8s)]
*  It was for all those people who were subjected to that level of harassment. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4719.8s)]
*  It was horrific. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4724.8s)]
*  It was horrible. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4727.8s)]
*  It was horrible. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4729.8s)]
*  I was subjected to that level of harassment. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4731.8s)]
*  It was horrific. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4734.8s)]
*  It was really bad. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4736.8s)]
*  Now 49, Winslet says she developed an armor that she brings to characters like Lee Miller. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4738.8s)]
*  People say, oh, you were so brave for this role. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4744.8s)]
*  You didn't wear any makeup. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4746.8s)]
*  You know, you had wrinkles. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4748.8s)]
*  Do we say to the men, oh, you were so brave for this role. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4750.8s)]
*  You grew a beard. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4753.8s)]
*  No, we don't. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4754.8s)]
*  That still happened to you? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4756.8s)]
*  Yes, it happens to me all the time. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4757.8s)]
*  It's not brave. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4759.8s)]
*  It's playing the part. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4760.8s)]
*  Is it true that a crew member came up to you and said you might want to kind of sit up a little bit. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4763.8s)]
*  You're showing a lump. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4769.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4771.8s)]
*  You might want to kind of just sit in, suck in, sit up. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4772.8s)]
*  And I was like. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4776.8s)]
*  You didn't. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4778.8s)]
*  I don't think Lee would have done. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4779.8s)]
*  It's about knowing that Lee's ease with her physical self was hard won. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4781.8s)]
*  In Hollywood, you could have a lot of great lights so that you don't see the lump that we all have, the bumps that we all have. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4787.8s)]
*  You know, I'm done. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4793.8s)]
*  You don't care about showing that. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4794.8s)]
*  No, I don't. I don't. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4796.8s)]
*  Why not? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4797.8s)]
*  It's exhausting. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4799.8s)]
*  When she's not filming, Winslet lives far from the spotlight in a quiet English seaside village. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4800.8s)]
*  She and her husband, Ned Abel Smith, have a 10-year-old son. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4807.8s)]
*  She also has a 20-year-old son and 24-year-old daughter from previous marriages. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4811.8s)]
*  Winslet is not on social media and told us she doesn't read reviews of her work, but this much she knows. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4816.8s)]
*  It's hard to make films about historical female figures. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4823.8s)]
*  You know, typically those aren't films that would necessarily do well in the box office. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4827.8s)]
*  Says she, sitting here proudly telling you that her film has taken over 25 million so far. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4831.8s)]
*  Cha-ching. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4835.8s)]
*  And we made a film about one woman. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4836.8s)]
*  So there's not a sense of, I told you so? [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4839.8s)]
*  No, I don't feel like that. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4841.8s)]
*  But I just hope they've seen the film. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4844.8s)]
*  Very few things in this country galvanize public opinion like someone trying to mess around with people's preferences in the bedroom. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4854.8s)]
*  I'm talking, of course, about what they watch on late night television. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4861.8s)]
*  And NBC found that out a few months ago when Conan O'Brien, the newly installed host of The Tonight Show, [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4865.8s)]
*  quit after the network announced it was going to push The Tonight Show into tomorrow [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4871.8s)]
*  and to give its traditional time slot back to O'Brien's predecessor, Jay Leno. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4876.8s)]
*  It triggered a lot of bad publicity for NBC, an outpouring of public support for Conan, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4881.8s)]
*  and some of the best late night jokes in a decade. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4886.8s)]
*  Conan walked away with a $32 million settlement and a new cable show, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4889.8s)]
*  and NBC did its best to push him into oblivion, legally prohibiting him from saying anything false or disparaging about the network [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4894.8s)]
*  and from giving interviews or appearing on television until now. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4901.8s)]
*  If you're wondering what happened to Conan O'Brien and what he thinks about all of this, you're about to find out. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4907.8s)]
*  So what's with the beard? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4913.8s)]
*  The first day that I woke up and was no longer the host of The Tonight Show, I remember the first thought I had is I am not shaving. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4916.8s)]
*  And that was my small victory. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4923.8s)]
*  Okay, so I lost The Tonight Show, but I'll show them I'll stop shaving. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4928.8s)]
*  This has been quite a year. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4932.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4935.8s)]
*  That's it. We're done. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4937.8s)]
*  This was a lot of fun. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4939.8s)]
*  This year has been incomprehensible, is still incomprehensible to me. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4942.8s)]
*  The amount of stuff that's happened in my life in the last year is, it's going to take me a long time to process it. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4946.8s)]
*  After leaving The Tonight Show in January and hanging out at his home trying to figure out what he was going to do with the rest of his life, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4957.8s)]
*  he decided the best therapy would be to get out of the house and back to work. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4964.8s)]
*  He assembled a lot of his old staff, opened a Twitter account, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4969.8s)]
*  That's the tweet. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4973.8s)]
*  and began planning a nationwide comedy tour, something that he had never done before and one of the few things he was allowed to do contractually. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4974.8s)]
*  See how things play out. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4982.8s)]
*  We met up with him in Seattle. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4983.8s)]
*  You must have been miserable the last couple of months. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4985.8s)]
*  I went through some stuff and got very depressed at times. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4987.8s)]
*  It was like a marriage breaking up suddenly, violently, quickly, and I was just trying to figure out what happened. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=4993.8s)]
*  When we started putting this tour together, I started to feel better almost immediately. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5000.8s)]
*  And then this, there's no better antidote to what I've just been through than to do this every night. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5006.8s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, why is the end of what is already already? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5012.8s)]
*  You know, doing this tour, though, this is a huge milestone for me. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5028.8s)]
*  This is the first time anybody has ever paid to see me. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5031.8s)]
*  Can you believe that? Yeah. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5036.8s)]
*  Oh, they've they've paid to make me go away. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5039.8s)]
*  The legally prohibited from being funny on television tour has boosted his confidence, [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5047.8s)]
*  kept him relevant and provided an outlet for him to explore his anger, disappointment and anxiety with mostly self-deprecating humor. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5052.8s)]
*  My own show again. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5060.8s)]
*  I just can't wait to have my own show again. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5063.8s)]
*  I'd even take a primetime show that's on at 10. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5067.8s)]
*  Anything to have my own show again. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5071.8s)]
*  After 40 performances in 32 cities in the U.S. and Canada, the tour will wind up next month at Radio City Music Hall in New York, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5074.8s)]
*  right next door to NBC's corporate headquarters, where this whole late night fiasco was cooked up. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5083.8s)]
*  I just want to say I couldn't be happier. You were the only choice. You were the perfect choice. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5089.8s)]
*  You have been an absolute gentleman in private and in the press. I agree. Conan Rocks. Good luck next week, my friend. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5093.8s)]
*  Jay, thank you for everything. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5100.8s)]
*  Less than one year after Jay Leno handed The Tonight Show off to Conan O'Brien, NBC decided to cancel Leno's disastrous primetime show [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5102.8s)]
*  and move him back into his old time period at 11.35 Eastern. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5111.8s)]
*  Conan's Tonight Show, which was losing badly in the ratings to David Letterman, was to be bumped back to 12.05 the next morning. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5116.8s)]
*  Was it in the back of your mind that, look, if I don't do that well, they could just pop Leno back in? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5123.8s)]
*  I'm a paranoid person. And I think I'm the kind of person that can come up with lots of negative scenarios. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5129.8s)]
*  But I remembered thinking that seemed like a stretch, that was a stretch, even for me. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5138.8s)]
*  What followed were some unpleasant discussions with NBC's West Coast brass. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5143.8s)]
*  It just felt like the tone went very quickly from, take your time, we understand this is a tough decision, to, you know, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5148.8s)]
*  let's go. You know, and that probably helped me a little bit feel like, you know what, this environment doesn't feel right. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5158.8s)]
*  And I've been with these people a long time and I don't like, I really don't like the way this is going. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5166.8s)]
*  And when it started to get toxic and I started to feel that I'm not sure these people even really want me here, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5173.8s)]
*  let's just, let's just, I can't do it. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5185.8s)]
*  Do you think they wanted you to leave? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5189.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's crossed my mind. I don't know how thought out this whole thing was. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5192.8s)]
*  But if they wanted me to leave, it worked. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5200.8s)]
*  This was just really, really hard for him. It was watching someone's heart get broken. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5205.8s)]
*  Liza O'Brien, Conan's wife, was one of his main confidants and closest advisors during the debacle. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5211.8s)]
*  Did you approve of everything that he did? [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5217.8s)]
*  100%, yeah. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5220.8s)]
*  You thought he should have left? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5222.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5223.8s)]
*  What do you think of the way he was treated by NBC? [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5224.8s)]
*  From my perspective, it felt like they never really gave him the job. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5227.8s)]
*  That they said, we're going to give you this job in five years, and they kept him with the company. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5231.8s)]
*  And they, they, you know, he said, I won't go anywhere else and I'll keep working for you and I'm in it for the long haul. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5237.8s)]
*  And it felt like they, they lost their nerve to really make a change. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5242.8s)]
*  And that was too bad. It was a shame because it would have been great to see what he could have done if he had had their full support and had some more time. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5246.8s)]
*  You've got this non-disparagement agreement. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5254.8s)]
*  Do you have a copy? Because I haven't read it in a while. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5256.8s)]
*  I have a copy somewhere in my bag. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5259.8s)]
*  I keep one in my wallet. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5261.8s)]
*  You can read it if you do. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5262.8s)]
*  Anytime people come up to me, hey, so what's the deal with, with Jay Leno? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5265.8s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5269.8s)]
*  He's a fine and good man. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5273.8s)]
*  We can put that away. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5276.8s)]
*  Can I assume that this interview would take a different tenor if that agreement did not exist? [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5278.8s)]
*  No, I don't think it would. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5282.8s)]
*  The biggest thing people come up and say to me in gas stations and restaurants, I have so many people say this to me. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5283.8s)]
*  Hey, partner, you got screwed. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5290.8s)]
*  I don't, and I always tell them, no, I didn't. I didn't get screwed. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5292.8s)]
*  I'm fine. It just, it didn't work out. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5295.8s)]
*  Well, you did get screwed. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5298.8s)]
*  You think I got screwed. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5299.8s)]
*  Well, I think most people think you got screwed. I mean, Jay Leno thinks you got screwed. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5301.8s)]
*  Jay Leno thinks he got screwed. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5305.8s)]
*  How did he get screwed? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5308.8s)]
*  It's like that part to me. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5312.8s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5316.8s)]
*  Jay's got the Tonight Show. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5317.8s)]
*  I have a beard and inflatable bat and I'm touring city to city. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5318.8s)]
*  Who can say who won and who lost? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5322.8s)]
*  I'm laughing because crying would be sad. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5326.8s)]
*  Has Jay reached out to you? [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5329.8s)]
*  No. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5331.8s)]
*  No calls? [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5333.8s)]
*  No, I do not. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5334.8s)]
*  I do not think I'll be hearing from him. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5335.8s)]
*  We should get him in here. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5338.8s)]
*  We should. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5339.8s)]
*  Is he going to, is it going to be a surprise walk on? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5340.8s)]
*  No, no. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5342.8s)]
*  But he'd call if you know his number or we can, I'm sure he'd come over. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5343.8s)]
*  He may have caller ID. He won't pick up. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5347.8s)]
*  I think Leno would say, look, I was riding high. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5350.8s)]
*  I was number one and I was still number one when I left and Conan made this deal with NBC [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5354.8s)]
*  and NBC said, okay, Jay, we're going to take you off the air in five years, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5361.8s)]
*  regardless of whether you're number one or number two or what. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5365.8s)]
*  I think he felt like he was forced out by NBC at a time when he was a strong number one [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5368.8s)]
*  and was pushed out the door. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5375.8s)]
*  That's his argument. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5380.8s)]
*  It's hard for me to get inside his head and argue his side of this whole thing. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5382.8s)]
*  I, here's what I can say. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5388.8s)]
*  I'm happy with my decision. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5391.8s)]
*  I sleep well at night and I, you know, hope he's happy with his decision. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5394.8s)]
*  Do you think that Jay lobbied for this? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5404.8s)]
*  I don't know, but what I know is what happened, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5405.8s)]
*  which is that he went and got a job at a local restaurant. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5411.8s)]
*  What I know is what happened, which is that he went and took that show back. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5416.8s)]
*  Do you believe he acted honorably during all of this? [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5422.8s)]
*  I don't think I can answer that. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5429.8s)]
*  I don't think, I can just tell you maybe how I would have handled it and I would do it differently. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5432.8s)]
*  You wouldn't have come back on The Tonight Show? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5444.8s)]
*  If I had surrendered The Tonight Show and handed it over to somebody publicly and wished them well, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5446.8s)]
*  and then I would not have come back six months later. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5453.8s)]
*  But that's me, you know. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5457.8s)]
*  Everyone's got their own way of doing things. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5459.8s)]
*  What would you have done? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5463.8s)]
*  Done something else, go someplace else. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5465.8s)]
*  I mean, that's just me. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5467.8s)]
*  He is equally disappointed with NBC, the company where he worked most of his adult life, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5468.8s)]
*  and with NBC Universal Chief Jeff Zucker, who he has known since they were classmates at Harvard. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5473.8s)]
*  Has Zucker called you? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5479.8s)]
*  No. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5480.8s)]
*  You haven't talked to Zucker since this offer was made to you. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5482.8s)]
*  That's right. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5486.8s)]
*  You know, at some point I'm sure I'm going to bump into these people, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5488.8s)]
*  and you know, I'm not sure we're going to be, have our arms around each other and drinking beer [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5491.8s)]
*  and singing old Irish fight songs, because I don't think they know any. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5499.8s)]
*  But you know, I wish, this is going to sound crazy, I do wish these people well. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5503.8s)]
*  Jeff Zucker was quoted as saying, at the end of the day, the viewers voted, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5515.8s)]
*  and they didn't like Conan as the host of The Tonight Show. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5520.8s)]
*  Can I take back what I just said? [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5525.8s)]
*  Do you take issue with that? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5528.8s)]
*  In my opinion, I don't think that's fair or accurate, but he's entitled to his opinion. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5530.8s)]
*  I think for anyone to say that the results were in after six months, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5534.8s)]
*  that doesn't ring true to me. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5540.8s)]
*  They said that for the first time in history, The Tonight Show was losing money. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5543.8s)]
*  I don't see how that's, I honestly don't see how that's possible. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5548.8s)]
*  It's really not possible. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5555.8s)]
*  It is impossible. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5558.8s)]
*  Did you expect NBC to give you more of a chance? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5560.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5565.8s)]
*  Absolutely. Yes. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5567.8s)]
*  Do you feel like it was a failure? My Tonight Show? No. Absolutely not. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5572.8s)]
*  Conan does agree with NBC's comments that it was a business decision motivated by money, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5579.8s)]
*  and he acknowledges that Leno had the more expensive contract and would have been even harder to let go. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5584.8s)]
*  Some people have reported that NBC would have had to pay him $150 million. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5590.8s)]
*  $150 million. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5594.8s)]
*  Yeah. If you look at it that way and you're working at, let's say, I don't know, you're working for General Electric, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5596.8s)]
*  and you tell them, there's this to make that guy go away, or there's this, that decision is probably pretty clear. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5605.8s)]
*  And I think, in my gut, I honestly believe everybody knows that's what happened. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5616.8s)]
*  They did what they had to do, and okay, I get it, and the only thing I take exception to is, subsequently, [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5625.8s)]
*  people saying, well, you know, Conan was losing money, and, you know, actually he was murdering cats. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5632.8s)]
*  What? You know, whatever. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5639.8s)]
*  Last month, Conan finally pulled the trigger on his future, raising some eyebrows by signing on to do an 11 o'clock show for the cable channel, TBS, and not with a broadcast network. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5641.8s)]
*  I do not look down my nose at cable, and I think anyone who does isn't paying attention to television these days, because this world is changing very quickly. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5653.8s)]
*  You've got $30 million that you didn't have before. You've got a very lucrative new gig on TBS, which has an audience that... [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5663.8s)]
*  Very young audience. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5674.8s)]
*  ...custom made for you. It wasn't all bad. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5676.8s)]
*  That's the point I keep making. It's crucial to me that anyone seeing this take, they take anything away from this. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5680.8s)]
*  It's, I'm fine. I'm doing great. I hope people still find me comedically absurd and ridiculous, and I don't regret anything. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5690.8s)]
*  I do believe, and this might be my Catholic upbringing or Irish magical thinking, but I think things happen for a reason. I really do. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5707.8s)]
*  I thought the Lutherans believed that. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5719.8s)]
*  Oh my God, it is Lutherans. Okay, I believe that if I experience any joy in life, I'll go to hell. That's what I believe. But you get my point. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5721.8s)]
*  I got really into gossip, girl, and sleeping in my car. Yes, I'll survive. Yes, I'll survive. Yeah, they kind of tried to kill me, but I'm here down the line. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5749.8s)]
*  I've got all my life to live. I've got so many shows to give. I'll survive. I will survive. I will survive. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5761.8s)]
*  The story of a child star done in by fame is as old as Hollywood itself. But the story of a child star from one of America's greatest acting families, who nearly destroys herself, then bounces back to become not just a leading lady, but a major film producer, well that story belongs only to Drew Barrymore. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5791.8s)]
*  She was famous by seven, abusing drugs by 11, and at 15 was washed up and on her own. She may have come from acting royalty, but in many ways she was an orphan, a wild child raised by crews on movie sets. She's 34 now, and though she still sometimes talks like a teenager, she's become one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood, succeeding far beyond what anyone could have predicted. How did she do it? That's what we wanted to find out. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5815.8s)]
*  We met up with Drew Barrymore on Broadway in New York. At the height of afternoon rush hour, she stopped traffic. Do you feel comfortable in New York? I feel very comfortable in New York. It's been a while, but a Barrymore on Broadway was something generations of New Yorkers were once used to. So the Barrymore Theater, welcome. I can't believe we're going here. This Broadway theater is named for her great-aunt Ethel, a legendary stage actress in the early 1900s. You have the same profile. Yeah, we have that profile. I'm a big fan of the theater. I'm a big fan of the theater. I'm a big fan of the theater. I'm a big fan of the theater. I'm a big fan of the theater. I'm a big fan of the theater. I'm a big fan of the theater. I'm a big fan of the theater. I'm a big fan of the theater. I'm a big fan of the theater. I'm a big fan of the theater. I'm a [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5842.8s)]
*  distinct, weird profile. It's a good profile. I don't want to be too self-congratulatory about it. I just love the fact that we have this sort of family stamp. That Barrymore stamp graced silver screens from silent movies through the 1940s. Her great-aunt Ethel and her grandfather, John Barrymore, were considered the greatest actors of their generation. May I say one thing? There is nothing to be said. Drew's [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5872.8s)]
*  great-uncle Lionel was a famous character actor who will forever be known as the sinister banker Potter in It's a Wonderful Life. You once called me a warped, frustrated old man. Acting has been the family business for hundreds of years. Going back to Georgiana Drew and John Drew and my great-grandfather Maurice Barrymore and this just, it was such a sort of circus of odd, interesting people. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5902.8s)]
*  That loved acting. Their Barrymores have been acting since George III was in power. Like the 14th century, it dates back to the family tree and I thought, well, I'm not crazy if I feel this magnetic bloodline pull to do this thing. She felt the pull as a child, but she'd been pushed into the business long before that. That's Drew when she was just 11 months old, starring in a commercial for dog food. Her big break in [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5932.8s)]
*  her life, however, came at the age of six when the blockbuster hit E.T. Drew's scene-stealing Gertie made her an international star. Movie audiences loved the precocious Gertie and so did director Steven Spielberg, who Drew calls her godfather. I've always said about Drew that she's tenaciously optimistic. And she had really, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5962.8s)]
*  the kind of imagination that not only invited E.T. into a reality within herself, but it invited all of us to believe that what Drew was seeing was true. On the set between takes, seven-year-old Drew used to talk with E.T. She'd tell him her secrets. I liked hanging out with him and I would bring him lunch and put a little handkerchief around his neck. But you knew he was fake. I knew he was fake, but that red-beating heart just said so much to me and I don't know, I just felt like I could talk to him. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=5992.8s)]
*  I just wanted to say goodbye. It turns out the little girl with the famous family was pretty much on her own. Her father, an actor who struggled with drugs and alcohol, was rarely around. Drew's mom, who also acted, had to work to support them both. On the movie set, Drew says she finally found a home. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6022.8s)]
*  When I did E.T., it sort of solidified, like, the only family I know are these film crews, these gypsies, these filmmakers. That was the solidification and the clicking revelation of this is what I want to do with my life and this is where I'm going to survive. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6042.8s)]
*  It was a family. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6059.8s)]
*  It was the perfect family. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6060.8s)]
*  So what's it like when a movie's over? [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6062.8s)]
*  That was the devastating part, was just, okay, if it's over, how do you keep this going? [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6064.8s)]
*  Because the family moves on. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6073.8s)]
*  Yep. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6074.8s)]
*  People get other jobs. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6075.8s)]
*  Yep. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6076.8s)]
*  There were plenty of other acting jobs for Drew after E.T., but there were plenty of other temptations as well. Her mom became her manager, but neither she nor her child seemed very much in control. By nine, Drew and her mom were regulars at nightclubs in Los Angeles and New York. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6077.8s)]
*  You had no discipline as a kid? [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6093.8s)]
*  None. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6095.8s)]
*  No authority? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6096.8s)]
*  None. None whatsoever. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6097.8s)]
*  No parental authority telling you, this is right, this is wrong? [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6098.8s)]
*  Quite the opposite. It was more like, can you get me into that club? It was very excessive and wild and hedonistic. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6101.8s)]
*  When did you start smoking? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6109.8s)]
*  When I was nine. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6110.8s)]
*  Nine? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6112.8s)]
*  Yeah. Not something I'm proud of at all. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6113.8s)]
*  When did you take your first drink? [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6116.8s)]
*  Somewhere around that same time. I thought the two went really nicely together. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6118.8s)]
*  And how about marijuana? [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6122.8s)]
*  Eleven. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6125.8s)]
*  Who gave you a joint at age eleven? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6126.8s)]
*  My friend's mom, actually, just to make it sound even crazier. Yeah, I was raised around hippies. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6129.8s)]
*  Cocaine? [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6135.8s)]
*  Twelve. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6137.8s)]
*  A twelve-year-old doing cocaine? [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6138.8s)]
*  I know, it's nuts. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6140.8s)]
*  Some people don't survive, though, that experience phase. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6141.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I also don't think that it has to be so heavy. It's like, oh, it's just so tragic. No, it wasn't. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6146.8s)]
*  It was an extraordinary experience. I went through it. And I learned a lot. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6153.8s)]
*  And did I learn it in front of everyone, which was righteously embarrassing? Sure. But you know what? Made me stronger. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6159.8s)]
*  It may have made her stronger, but at the time it wasn't clear she'd get through it. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6168.8s)]
*  At the age of thirteen, she was forced into rehab and ended up in treatment on and off for more than a year. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6172.8s)]
*  When you were in rehab, your dad called you. But he was calling to ask you for money. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6178.8s)]
*  Great dad. Yeah, yeah, he would ask me for money on birthdays and, you know, in inappropriate times. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6185.8s)]
*  And then I just wrote him off, like, you're not a father. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6194.8s)]
*  I just learned you cannot emotionally invest in people who are not attainable. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6197.8s)]
*  She'd also learned that she could legally separate herself from her parents. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6203.8s)]
*  She discovered that from, of all places, a movie she starred in. It was called Irreconcilable Differences. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6207.8s)]
*  The reason I went to a lawyer to divorce my parents is because I can't take living with either one of them anymore. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6214.8s)]
*  At fifteen, out of rehab, Drew Barrymore petitioned the state of California to emancipate herself, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6221.8s)]
*  arguing she'd be better off without her mother and father. The court agreed, and she was on her own. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6227.8s)]
*  I did what I had to do to get there, which was play by the rules and re-figure out my life [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6234.8s)]
*  and disconnect myself from the people I knew and the lifestyle I knew and, you know, [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6240.8s)]
*  prove that I was a responsible citizen with a good head out of my shoulders. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6246.8s)]
*  And I did. And therefore I was rewarded by being emancipated. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6251.8s)]
*  You get your own apartment. Yeah. Signed your own lease. Yes. You got a job. Yes. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6256.8s)]
*  What kind of a job? I worked at a coffee house called The Living Room, and my boss just hated me. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6261.8s)]
*  He was just like, please, at one point he was like, go live your dreams and get out of my shop. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6267.8s)]
*  The court's agents told her she was overweight and unemployable, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6275.8s)]
*  but she missed acting and missed the impromptu families that film sets create. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6278.8s)]
*  I missed my tribe, and I was really alone out there, and so I just started going on auditions again. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6283.8s)]
*  It took her years of TV movies and small roles in low-budget films, but Drew Barrymore won Hollywood and audiences back. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6292.8s)]
*  The sense of humor and girl-next-door appeal have made her a leading lady in a number of hugely successful romantic comedies. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6300.8s)]
*  People seem to root for her, no matter what the film is, no matter what role she's in or what she's doing. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6308.8s)]
*  Well, you know, it's very easy to root for the little girl in E.T. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6313.8s)]
*  And that little girl has grown up, and she's still the same character that she was in E.T. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6317.8s)]
*  You know, she just has a kind of... she casts a spell. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6322.8s)]
*  Unlike many Hollywood-leading ladies, she's remarkably approachable onscreen and off. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6326.8s)]
*  She never seems afraid to reveal too much, even if she sometimes goes too far. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6331.8s)]
*  About that eye-popping late-night appearance in 1995, she says she has no regrets. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6337.8s)]
*  I felt like Pan. I was like, you know, in the forest, thinking that life was some hippie nudist colony, [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6344.8s)]
*  you know, get on David Letterman's desk and just be free and have fun, and that's just who I was. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6351.8s)]
*  That is still part of who she is, but in Hollywood she's increasingly taken seriously as an actor and a producer. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6356.8s)]
*  This year she was nominated for an Emmy, playing eccentric socialite Edie Biel, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6364.8s)]
*  a woman made famous by the 1975 documentary Grey Gardens. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6368.8s)]
*  This is the real Edie Biel. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6373.8s)]
*  It's very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6376.8s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? It's awfully difficult. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6380.8s)]
*  And this is Drew Barrymore's portrayal. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6383.8s)]
*  It's very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present. Awfully difficult. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6386.8s)]
*  As a producer, Drew has made movies that have grossed more than $900 million. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6393.8s)]
*  The walls of her Hollywood office are covered with photos and movie stills she uses for inspiration. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6399.8s)]
*  They just constantly remind me of what it is I'm trying to do. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6405.8s)]
*  Her latest focus is directing. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6410.8s)]
*  Right where you are. Perfect. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6412.8s)]
*  Her directorial debut is a film called Whip It, an unusual coming-of-age story set in the world of Texas roller derby. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6414.8s)]
*  The little girl who grew up on movie sets is now in charge of them. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6423.8s)]
*  You've created your own family. Absolutely. And everybody gets the chance to do that. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6428.8s)]
*  It's her friends who are now her family. Many of them work with Drew on all her films. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6433.8s)]
*  She currently isn't speaking with her own mother and hasn't for a long time. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6438.8s)]
*  She reconciled with her father shortly before he died in 2004. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6442.8s)]
*  There are a lot of us little gypsies out there that need to go and find another place, you know, a safer, healthier, or just a different venue in order to develop and find ourselves. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6447.8s)]
*  I am so lucky to live the life that I do. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6459.8s)]
*  2023 was the year the world learned to pronounce Killian. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6471.8s)]
*  The ancient Irish name seemed to be on everyone's lips as the film Oppenheimer became a blockbuster, winning seven Oscars, including Best Actor for Killian Murphy. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6476.8s)]
*  Murphy has worked nonstop for nearly 30 years, but it was the epic drama of the atomic bomb that ignited a star. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6489.8s)]
*  As we told you last winter, Murphy seems to be more famous than well-known. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6498.8s)]
*  So we set out to learn more. We were warned the 48-year-old Irishman is reserved and wouldn't talk about himself. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6503.8s)]
*  But we discovered finding Killian Murphy depends on where you look. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6511.8s)]
*  Ireland's Dingle Peninsula was named for a goddess before such things were written, and for 6,000 years, stories have passed by ear. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6529.8s)]
*  So if verse inhabits every Irish soul, then in a country pub, Killian Murphy is among peers, as he would have it, just a man with a pint to lift and no fame to bear. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6541.8s)]
*  What is the meaning of Ireland to you? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6552.8s)]
*  I don't think I can answer that question. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6557.8s)]
*  It's defined who I am as a person and my values. It's just home. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6559.8s)]
*  Home includes his wife of 20 years, two teenage sons, and Scout, a lab named for the character in the film. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6567.8s)]
*  That figures, Murphy has always let stories lead his path. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6576.8s)]
*  You find so much empathy in novels, because there you are putting yourself into somebody else's point of view. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6581.8s)]
*  I've always been a big reader of the book, and I've always been a big reader of the book. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6588.8s)]
*  I've always been a big reader of the book. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6593.8s)]
*  I've always been a big reader of the book. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6596.8s)]
*  I've always been a big reader of the book. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6598.8s)]
*  Because there you are putting yourself into somebody else's point of view. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6600.8s)]
*  I've always been a big reader. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6604.8s)]
*  When a movie can connect with someone and they feel seen or feel heard, or a novel can change somebody's life, or a piece of music, an album can change someone's life, [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6607.8s)]
*  and I've had all that happen to me, and that's the power of good art, I think. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6617.8s)]
*  There's a straight line from the music in the pub to Oppenheimer. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6621.8s)]
*  I think they're from the same source. I mean, I really do. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6626.8s)]
*  I don't see, I see it's all in a continuum. You know what I mean? It's just a form of expression. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6629.8s)]
*  Expression in the eyes of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who created the atom bomb, but never controlled it. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6634.8s)]
*  If they detonated too high in the air, the blast wouldn't be as powerful. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6643.8s)]
*  With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer, we'll take it from here. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6647.8s)]
*  I remember reading at the beginning about him that he was more riddled than answer, and I thought, oh, okay, wow, that's interesting. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6652.8s)]
*  I'm curious about your notes. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6663.8s)]
*  The riddle was in this script by writer-director Christopher Nolan, printed in red so it couldn't be photocopied. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6665.8s)]
*  I did genuinely think it was one of the greatest screenplays I'd ever read. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6674.8s)]
*  And you told him, I'll do it? [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6677.8s)]
*  I mean, I said I'd do it before I read it. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6679.8s)]
*  That's quite a risk. Why would you do that? [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6681.8s)]
*  It's always paid off for me, you know, in every film that I've worked with him on. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6684.8s)]
*  I'm not going back. I'm not going back. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6688.8s)]
*  There have been six Chris Nolan films for Murphy, Dunkirk, Inception, and three Batman titles. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6693.8s)]
*  Would you like to see my mask? [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6702.8s)]
*  You told me that getting a film made and getting it seen is a miracle. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6706.8s)]
*  It is. And then if it's anyway good, that's a miracle. And then if it connects with audiences, that's a miracle. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6711.8s)]
*  So it's a miracle upon miracle upon miracle to have a film like Oppenheimer. It really is. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6718.8s)]
*  His Oppenheimer was not so much a miracle as hard work. He lost 28 pounds to get the silhouette. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6725.8s)]
*  Then he rose to the character step by step over six months, reading, listening to Oppenheimer's lectures, and covering miles on the beach, performing for Scout. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6732.8s)]
*  I remember at one point I said to Chris, Chris, there appears to be, he appears to speak Dutch here, and I think he's giving a lecture in Dutch here. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6746.8s)]
*  What are we going to do about that? And Chris said, I mean, what are you going to do about that? [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6755.8s)]
*  The bulls think to us in an alpha deltia in an at home. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6759.8s)]
*  Frank afforded for shielding energy in the forbinding is open. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6762.8s)]
*  I mean, the relative at trans. What's he saying? [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6765.8s)]
*  Murphy says he put all he learned in the back of his mind and acted on instinct. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6768.8s)]
*  I think instinct is your most powerful tool that you have as an actor. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6774.8s)]
*  Nothing must be predetermined. So therefore you mustn't have a plan about how you're going to play stuff. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6778.8s)]
*  And I love that. It's like being buffeted by the wind and being buffeted by emotion. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6785.8s)]
*  You don't get to commit this in. And then I was all feel sorry for you. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6789.8s)]
*  Emily Blunt plays Oppenheimer's tormented wife. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6794.8s)]
*  He's very visceral to be in a scene with. It's like you, he transports you. He'll kidnap you in a scene. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6798.8s)]
*  My favorite acting moment of his in Oppenheimer is the scene after the bomb has been dropped. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6809.8s)]
*  And he's addressing all of the people at Los Alamos. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6816.8s)]
*  The world. Will remember this day. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6819.8s)]
*  He somehow welds together the concept of being proud of what they did and regretting it very deeply. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6827.8s)]
*  Yes, yes. All at the same time. I know. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6836.8s)]
*  It's too soon to. It's too soon to determine what the results of the bombing are. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6839.8s)]
*  But I'll bet the Japanese didn't like it. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6848.8s)]
*  No one moment is about one thing. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6853.8s)]
*  And if you're as agile as someone like Killian and is vulnerable and is clever, you can play it all. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6856.8s)]
*  But I don't know if many people can do what he does. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6864.8s)]
*  Killian Murphy discovered agility in his hometown Cork. His mother was a teacher, his father a school inspector. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6868.8s)]
*  In high school, Murphy and his brother had a band. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6877.8s)]
*  Performing led to acting class and his first play. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6883.8s)]
*  This is more like the size of a storage room than a theater. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6887.8s)]
*  Yeah, but that's all we were used to. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6891.8s)]
*  His first theater, 1996, age 20, the play was Disco Pigs, which grew to bigger theaters and became a movie. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6893.8s)]
*  Why did you think you could be an actor? [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6903.8s)]
*  I didn't. I was very comfortable on stage in front of an audience from when I was little. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6905.8s)]
*  I never had any nerves doing that. I felt that natural, you know, and thrilling. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6911.8s)]
*  In this theater, what did you learn about acting? [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6918.8s)]
*  There's a fire escape door right there and that's a kind of an alleyway there. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6923.8s)]
*  And so you get a lot of like drunk guys out of their mind bashing up against the fire escape door. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6929.8s)]
*  And it used to kind of energize us. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6935.8s)]
*  So I remember learning about like taking whatever you have, sort of responding to whatever the energy is in the room and using it. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6937.8s)]
*  That's really good training. Maintaining your character with the drunk guy yelling through the fire escape door. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6946.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And I think theater is such an absurd undertaking when you think of it, you know, because at any point it could collapse and go wrong. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6953.8s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6964.8s)]
*  Yeah, and I love that aspect of it. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6965.8s)]
*  That love led him to drop law school. And since then, there have been a dozen plays and 40 movies. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6967.8s)]
*  I love it when it becomes an immersive experience. I love getting lost in it. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6976.8s)]
*  In the early days, that was with theater, it felt kind of extraordinary that with just the power of will and a couple of lights and a good script, we were creating this world. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6984.8s)]
*  So that's kind of addictive when it works well. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6995.8s)]
*  It worked well in 2013 in a breakout role as a leading man. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=6997.8s)]
*  In the series Peaky Blinders, Murphy plays Thomas Shelby, who survives World War One to lead a family of gangsters. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7003.8s)]
*  You're mostly in the war, so you know the battle plans always change and get up. Well, here it is. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7013.8s)]
*  They're all damaged, broken men, but something got knocked in him and he came back with this incredible drive and ambition and like, I'm not afraid of death, so now I can do whatever I want. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7019.8s)]
*  In Tommy Shelby, you created a sympathetic, relatable monster. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7038.8s)]
*  Kill and kill. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7044.8s)]
*  The only way to make people listen. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7048.8s)]
*  I like to be challenged and when I read something, I want to go, I don't really know how I can do that. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7051.8s)]
*  In 10 years of Peaky Blinders, Murphy came into his own. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7060.8s)]
*  I heard very early on in my career, a director, it was one of the Sidneys, it couldn't be in Sidney Pollock, but one of them said, it takes 30 years to make an actor. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7065.8s)]
*  It's not just technique and experience and all that, it's maturing as a human being and trying to grapple with life and figure it out and all of that stuff. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7076.8s)]
*  So by the time you've been doing it for 30 years, you've all of that banked, hopefully. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7090.8s)]
*  And eventually then I think you'll get to a point where you might be an OK actor. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7095.8s)]
*  Maturing is the theme of Murphy's new film based on the novel Small Things Like These. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7104.8s)]
*  He plays Bill Furlong, tormented by the injustice he sees. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7111.8s)]
*  His wife fears that his empathy will upend their lives. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7116.8s)]
*  Don't you ever question this, Will? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7123.8s)]
*  If you want to get on in this life, there are things you have to ignore. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7126.8s)]
*  That's Eileen Walsh. No actor has known Murphy longer. She was his first partner in Disco Pigs 28 years ago. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7142.8s)]
*  Is his work ethic rooted in fear or joy? [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7153.8s)]
*  Oh, that's a good question. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7158.8s)]
*  I think it can only be joy, but it sometimes takes a lot of pain to get to that joy. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7162.8s)]
*  The deeper we go with acting, the cost is greater for us. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7169.8s)]
*  And physically, I know Oppenheimer has cast him for the weight loss he insisted. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7174.8s)]
*  And it was his choice to do, and it was the right choice to create that amazing silhouette. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7183.8s)]
*  But from the very beginning, our warm-ups for Disco Pigs involved us punching each other quite hard. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7189.8s)]
*  And like going for it and then bursting out into it. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7199.8s)]
*  This huge ball of velocity coming into it was the beginning of an Oppenheimer, was the whole kind of atom of us. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7205.8s)]
*  Now, after three decades of work, Killian Murphy is cast in the most familiar Irish legend of all, [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7214.8s)]
*  with a 24-carat gold-plated statue at the end of his long spectrum of talent. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7224.8s)]
*  You have screwed this up, though. You know. In what way? [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7232.8s)]
*  You used to be an actor. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7237.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7239.8s)]
*  Am I? I think you could be both. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7240.8s)]
*  You know, I've never understood that term, really, movie star. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7243.8s)]
*  I've always just felt like I'm an actor. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7247.8s)]
*  That's, I think, a term for other people rather than for me. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7250.8s)]
*  Of all the actors that have passed through Hollywood, very few, if any, have had a career like Bryan Cranston. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7270.8s)]
*  He knocked around Tinseltown for decades before finally landing his first leading role at 50, Walter White, on Breaking Bad, a very tough act to follow. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7277.8s)]
*  But since then, thanks for Cranston, it had been breaking good. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7288.8s)]
*  He won a Tony Award on Broadway, an Oscar nomination in Hollywood, all while writing his memoir. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7291.8s)]
*  It's testimony to his talent, patience, perseverance, and luck. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7298.8s)]
*  Bryan Cranston was born and raised in Los Angeles and had been a familiar face here for decades, but never a star. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7303.8s)]
*  That officially changed three years ago when the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce embedded his name in a sidewalk. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7312.8s)]
*  I have often walked down this street before, but the pavement never held my star before. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7320.8s)]
*  All at once I'm three stories high, knowing I'm on the street where it lives. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7329.8s)]
*  Since then, it's only gotten better. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7338.8s)]
*  At age 60, he is on Hollywood's A-list and a red carpet regular, and no one was more surprised than Cranston. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7341.8s)]
*  I didn't feel entitled to become a star. I didn't expect it. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7348.8s)]
*  Did you want it? [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7353.8s)]
*  Not really. The things you want professionally are opportunities. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7354.8s)]
*  And through my good fortune, that's what's happened. Opportunity has come to me. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7359.8s)]
*  And when it came, late in his career, Cranston knocked it out of the park. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7366.8s)]
*  Maybe you and I could partner up. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7371.8s)]
*  You want to cook crystal meth? [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7373.8s)]
*  That's right. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7375.8s)]
*  When we first started, we were just telling a story and trying to do our best. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7376.8s)]
*  And it just started to steamroll and became this juggernaut. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7380.8s)]
*  Did you see it coming? [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7384.8s)]
*  No. Not at all. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7385.8s)]
*  It's a familiar story now. A meek and depressed high school chemistry teacher with terminal cancer [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7388.8s)]
*  cooks up a scheme to make and market a superior grade of methamphetamine to provide a nest egg for his family after he's gone. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7394.8s)]
*  But over the course of five seasons, Walter White goes from milk toast to murderous in order to survive. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7403.8s)]
*  I was just infused with ideas and I would dream about it and wake up and go, oh, I have another idea about Walter White. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7410.8s)]
*  You clearly don't know who you're talking to. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7418.8s)]
*  It was so well written and it just got into my soul. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7421.8s)]
*  I am the danger. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7424.8s)]
*  It was Cranston's first real opportunity to show what he could do as an actor. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7426.8s)]
*  Run. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7431.8s)]
*  The result was new respect in a closet full of Emmys. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7432.8s)]
*  When the show finally ended, he saw it as a new beginning and an opportunity to try something completely different. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7436.8s)]
*  It had been years since Cranston had performed on stage, yet he decided to sign on with a theater company in Boston that was doing a new play called All the Way about Lyndon Johnson, a very complicated character. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7443.8s)]
*  It had to be an amazing challenge. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7457.8s)]
*  I mean, why did you do it? [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7460.8s)]
*  He was Shakespearean in size and I thought, oh, boy, that's a big bite to take. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7461.8s)]
*  And it scares me a little bit. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7467.8s)]
*  So let's do it. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7469.8s)]
*  And there were reasons to be scared. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7471.8s)]
*  I realized, oh, my God, this is an enormous play and it's almost all me. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7473.8s)]
*  Big, big chunks of speeches, speeches, speeches. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7479.8s)]
*  And I started to panic. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7482.8s)]
*  It is all or nothing. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7484.8s)]
*  But in Boston and later on Broadway and after that, a film version for HBO, his performance was so on the mark. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7486.8s)]
*  Let us begin. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7494.8s)]
*  You had to remind yourself it was Cranston and not Johnson. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7496.8s)]
*  I love you more than my own daddy. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7500.8s)]
*  But if you get in my way, I'll crush you. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7507.8s)]
*  Look at that. Look at that. Look at those sizes there. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7513.8s)]
*  After winning a Tony Award, Broadway's highest honors, he topped it off with an Oscar nominated performance in the film Trumbo. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7517.8s)]
*  Wow. That's quite a run. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7525.8s)]
*  Surprising for an old journeyman actor. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7527.8s)]
*  Got a few clips to show you here. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7531.8s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7533.8s)]
*  OK, roll it. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7534.8s)]
*  What the hell is wrong with you? [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7535.8s)]
*  Cranston has been a working actor since his mid 20s. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7536.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7540.8s)]
*  Very sweet. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7541.8s)]
*  Beginning with the part on the soap opera Loving. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7542.8s)]
*  That attraction is our business, all right? [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7545.8s)]
*  And after there's been everything from the sublime to the ridiculous. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7547.8s)]
*  Good guys, bad guys. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7552.8s)]
*  He's dead. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7554.8s)]
*  I'm sorry. We did everything we could. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7555.8s)]
*  And sometimes parts so small, even Cranston's forgotten them. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7557.8s)]
*  What is that? [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7561.8s)]
*  Says here it's Amazon women on the moon. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7562.8s)]
*  Five minutes with the widow. Do you mind? [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7564.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7565.8s)]
*  I'll take care of you later. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7566.8s)]
*  You ended up on the cutting room floor. That's why you've never seen. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7567.8s)]
*  Amazon women on the moon. Who could forget? [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7570.8s)]
*  Who wants to remember is a better question, actually. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7573.8s)]
*  But I promise myself. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7576.8s)]
*  In all, there have been nearly 150 roles, [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7577.8s)]
*  not counting the early commercials that helped pay the bills. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7580.8s)]
*  Now you can relieve and flame hemorrhoidal tissue with the oxygen action of Preparation H. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7583.8s)]
*  Oxygen action. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7588.8s)]
*  Do you think you've grown as an actor since then? [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7590.8s)]
*  No, but my hemorrhoid has grown. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7593.8s)]
*  There were guest spots on just about every show on television. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7596.8s)]
*  Hello, Tim. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7599.8s)]
*  Including five appearances on Seinfeld. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7600.8s)]
*  Jerry. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7603.8s)]
*  Hey, Tim. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7604.8s)]
*  As Jerry's smarmy dentist, Dr. Tim Wadley. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7605.8s)]
*  Cheryl, would you ready the nitrous oxide, please? [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7608.8s)]
*  It was like going to comedy boot camp for me being on that show. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7610.8s)]
*  And comedy proved to be something that Bryan Cranston was very good at. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7614.8s)]
*  I just want to celebrate another day of living. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7620.8s)]
*  It led to his breakout role in the widely acclaimed series, Malcolm in the Middle, [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7625.8s)]
*  as Hal, the hapless father, overwhelmed by the chaos of a dysfunctional family. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7630.8s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7636.8s)]
*  There's something we have to talk about. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7637.8s)]
*  He was insecure, you know, not in charge. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7640.8s)]
*  Hello, Hal. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7643.8s)]
*  He took brain vacations often. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7645.8s)]
*  Malcolm earned Cranston a modicum of fame, three Emmy nominations, [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7650.8s)]
*  and a reputation as an actor who was willing to do anything. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7654.8s)]
*  Those are real bees? [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7658.8s)]
*  Yeah, those are real bees. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7659.8s)]
*  There were 75,000 of them. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7661.8s)]
*  Call animal control. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7663.8s)]
*  And yes, he got stung. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7666.8s)]
*  Where were you stung? [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7668.8s)]
*  In the lower region, in one of the buoys down below. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7670.8s)]
*  Sensitive spot. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7674.8s)]
*  Very sensitive. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7675.8s)]
*  The beekeeper went, sorry. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7676.8s)]
*  I'll help you anywhere else, but I'm not going to. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7679.8s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7681.8s)]
*  Now, you are going to get up and pull it down. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7682.8s)]
*  He did seven seasons on Malcolm and hated to see it go, [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7685.8s)]
*  but the show's cancellation turned out to be a very lucky moment. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7688.8s)]
*  Had Malcolm in the Middle been picked up, [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7693.8s)]
*  I would not have been available for the pilot of Breaking Bad. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7695.8s)]
*  And right now, someone else would be sitting in this chair talking to you, not me. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7698.8s)]
*  Luck, both good and bad, figures a lot in Cranston's life and in the memoir he's just written. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7703.8s)]
*  It's published by Simon & Schuster, which is owned by CBS. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7708.8s)]
*  He grew up in a family that knew firsthand the uncertainty of a life in show business. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7712.8s)]
*  His parents were both actors. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7718.8s)]
*  His mother gave it up to raise Brian, his brother, and his sister, [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7720.8s)]
*  while his father struggled to make a name for himself in Hollywood. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7724.8s)]
*  He really wanted to be a star. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7727.8s)]
*  He really wanted to hit big. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7730.8s)]
*  Observation post number three to emergency lab. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7732.8s)]
*  But mostly, Joe Cranston got small parts in films like The Beginning of the End, [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7735.8s)]
*  getting eaten by giant grasshoppers. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7740.8s)]
*  Eventually, his father realized that playing bit parts was about as far as he was going to go. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7746.8s)]
*  There would be no stardom. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7752.8s)]
*  He had a massive middle-aged breakdown and left the family, [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7754.8s)]
*  and then it just completely fell apart. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7761.8s)]
*  And my mother was heartbroken, just completely devastated. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7764.8s)]
*  To make ends meet, we started selling off all our possessions. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7768.8s)]
*  You were poor. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7773.8s)]
*  Yeah. We had our house foreclosed on. We were kicked out. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7774.8s)]
*  It was the 1960s, and Brian was 11 years old. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7779.8s)]
*  Being from a divorced family almost felt like a scarlet letter at times, and I denied it for a long time. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7783.8s)]
*  In fact, I told our dear friends, the Burrell boys, five boys lived next door to us, [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7789.8s)]
*  why we don't see your dad anymore? [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7795.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. I lied. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7797.8s)]
*  I said, he comes home at night when you guys are in bed. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7799.8s)]
*  He gets us out and we play. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7801.8s)]
*  I said it so much, I started to believe it myself. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7805.8s)]
*  The abandonment by his father created anger and resentment, [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7809.8s)]
*  and also a deep reservoir of life lessons and emotions that he would draw upon as he grew older [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7813.8s)]
*  and decided to become an actor, the perils of stardom and the importance of family. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7819.8s)]
*  Thirty years ago on a forgettable show called Airwolf, he met another young actor who was unforgettable. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7825.8s)]
*  You were nothing. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7831.8s)]
*  There's Robin. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7832.8s)]
*  A spoiled, rich kid who never had to pay for anything. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7833.8s)]
*  He was the bad guy, and Robin Dearden was one of his hostages. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7837.8s)]
*  He was an amazing actor and one of the funniest people I had ever met. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7842.8s)]
*  And it worked. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7846.8s)]
*  It took a while for you to get together, right? [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7847.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. We ran into each other like eight months later, and we kissed for like a second too long. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7850.8s)]
*  Let me demonstrate. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7856.8s)]
*  When you greet a friend, this is the duration of the kiss that's acceptable. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7860.8s)]
*  Hi. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7864.8s)]
*  Good to see you. Yeah. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7865.8s)]
*  When you make a mistake and stay too long at the lips, this is how long it is. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7867.8s)]
*  Hi. How are you? [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7872.8s)]
*  Good to see you. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7873.8s)]
*  And that's what happened. It was like, uh-oh, what was that? Oh. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7877.8s)]
*  It was. It was like, oops. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7882.8s)]
*  The kiss sealed the deal, and they were married in 1989. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7884.8s)]
*  Among the well-wishers were Cranston's mother and father, keeping their distance from each other. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7888.8s)]
*  Look at Robin. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7894.8s)]
*  Brian and Robin have been married for 27 years now. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7895.8s)]
*  They still live in the same house where they raised their daughter, and Brian still goes to work most every day. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7898.8s)]
*  Oh, this is where you're shooting the scene. This is where we're shooting the scene. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7904.8s)]
*  We're in Brooklyn on the set of Sneaky Pete. Let's get busy. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7907.8s)]
*  A 10-part crime drama Cranston is doing for Amazon Prime on the new frontier of original streaming video. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7910.8s)]
*  Oh, my God. Okay. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7917.8s)]
*  He shoehorned it into his schedule between writing the book and making a couple of new movies. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7919.8s)]
*  This is his baby, and he's running the show, doing four jobs at once. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7924.8s)]
*  Okay. So you're a co-creator. Yeah. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7928.8s)]
*  You're directing. Yeah. Executive producer. Right. Actor. Yes. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7930.8s)]
*  I do force myself to sleep with myself to get the job, but that's always a disappointment. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7935.8s)]
*  What's really important... [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7941.8s)]
*  This day, he's wearing his director's hat, checking camera angles... Yeah. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7942.8s)]
*  ...and answering questions from the cast, which includes Margot Martindale. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7946.8s)]
*  Margot, why don't you take the blouse off and try this on now? [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7950.8s)]
*  Okay. Thank you. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7952.8s)]
*  It's a busy time, but Cranston wants to take advantage of every opportunity his good fortune has brought him, while his career is still hot. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7957.8s)]
*  Do you really believe that there's going to be a time when people said, no, no, thank you, not him anymore? [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7966.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You do? Oh, it's cyclical. I'm riding a wave right now, and I recognize that, but I want to do as much work as I can, do the best I can. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7970.8s)]
*  And when it's all said and done, and they say, get out of the water, you're done, I want to be so exhausted that I look forward to it. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7980.8s)]
*  It's like, oh, you're right. I don't want to have anything left in the tank. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7989.8s)]
*  We thought we would be remiss if we ended this story without revealing to Cranston's many fans some very personal information he shared while discussing his two favorite characters, Hal on Malcolm in the Middle and Walter White from Breaking Bad. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=7993.8s)]
*  Big difference between Hal and Walter White. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8008.8s)]
*  There's quite a bit of difference between them. Although Tidy Whities were in common. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8010.8s)]
*  Running theme? [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8014.8s)]
*  That was a thing. I thought about that. For Hal, it was that he was just a big boy, so the Tidy Whities seemed to make sense. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8015.8s)]
*  For Walt, the Tidy Whities also made sense because they were pathetic. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8025.8s)]
*  Pathetic? Yeah. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8030.8s)]
*  Does that mean you wear boxers? [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8031.8s)]
*  I do. I do wear boxers. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8033.8s)]
*  Or nothing at all. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8037.8s)]
*  Every once in a while, you draw the short straw here at 60 Minutes. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8051.8s)]
*  This time, we were told to spend a few days with a woman who is often called the most beautiful woman in the world, Angelina Jolie. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8055.8s)]
*  She may well be the most photographed, the most recognizable, and the highest paid actress in Hollywood. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8064.8s)]
*  She's certainly the number one target for paparazzi everywhere. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8070.8s)]
*  And that's how many Americans know her from the tabloids as wild, weird, and eccentric. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8075.8s)]
*  But the Angelina we met was quite different from all that. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8082.8s)]
*  For starters, she just wrote and directed a film about a very serious topic. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8085.8s)]
*  It'll be released next month, and she doesn't even appear in it. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8091.8s)]
*  For the first time, Angelina has moved behind the camera where she says she feels more comfortable. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8095.8s)]
*  We linked up with her in the indisputably beautiful city of Budapest, which is where she shot most of her film, In the Land of Blood and Honey. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8103.8s)]
*  We came here to Budapest for logistics and for financial reasons because we're a tiny movie. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8112.8s)]
*  It may be a tiny movie, but look at it. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8117.8s)]
*  It's about a heavy subject, the war in Bosnia, which was fought in the early 90s, killed at least 100,000 people, [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8121.8s)]
*  and brought ethnic cleansing to Europe for the first time since Hitler. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8129.8s)]
*  What did your friends and colleagues say when you said, hey, I'm going to direct a film about the war in Bosnia? [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8134.8s)]
*  I think people that really know me weren't surprised, but I think they all thought it was a bit crazy. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8140.8s)]
*  I think everybody still thinks it's a bit, you know, it's not, I still think it's crazy. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8144.8s)]
*  You could have done a light comedy or an action flick. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8149.8s)]
*  I think I'd be terrible with a comedy. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8152.8s)]
*  There's certainly no humor in this movie about a Muslim woman named Isla who starts to fall in love with a Serb named Daniel. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8155.8s)]
*  After the war breaks out, Bosnians are rounded up and locked up by the Serbs, and Daniel, a Serb captain, becomes Isla's jailer. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8163.8s)]
*  This is a gorgeous building. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8172.8s)]
*  It is a gorgeous building. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8173.8s)]
*  You made horrible things happen inside here. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8175.8s)]
*  And beautiful things. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8177.8s)]
*  Angelina shot the jail scenes in this Budapest museum, and she relied heavily on her actors. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8179.8s)]
*  They all come from the former Yugoslavia. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8185.8s)]
*  She let them rewrite scenes, and they speak the native language in the film, which will be released with English subtitles. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8187.8s)]
*  Angelina said she wanted to make the film as realistic as possible. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8194.8s)]
*  We all spoke about every speech, every scene, and made sure that it was right and true. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8199.8s)]
*  Everybody helped to educate me, and we all adjusted the script together. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8205.8s)]
*  Can you see? [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8209.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8210.8s)]
*  While we were there, Angelina gave the cast a sneak preview of the film's trailer. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8211.8s)]
*  Wow. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8221.8s)]
*  And they thought it reflected the reality of their war. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8222.8s)]
*  Goran Kostich and Zana Marjanovic play the two lovers. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8227.8s)]
*  People I know and my friends and their families never thought in their life that everything they had could be taken away from them. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8232.8s)]
*  It goes to the core of who I am and what I am and what we are, I suppose. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8242.8s)]
*  It's very personal. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8246.8s)]
*  Others might find the plot implausible, an affair between a Muslim prisoner and the Serb commandant of the prison where women are getting raped every day. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8247.8s)]
*  Some Bosnian women who had been through that found the film objectionable. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8258.8s)]
*  The Bosnian government temporarily withdrew Angelina's permit to shoot there. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8262.8s)]
*  You walked into a minefield, and when you were writing the script, did you realize that every step you took, there was a mine in your way? [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8267.8s)]
*  I didn't know it was going to be as sensitive. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8278.8s)]
*  Everything, everything was something to be very careful about and sensitive. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8281.8s)]
*  But Angelina says, remember, it's a movie, a love story, not a documentary. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8287.8s)]
*  There's a lot of heart. There's also a lot of brutality. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8293.8s)]
*  There's a lot of brutality. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8296.8s)]
*  A lot more than there ever was in a film that you acted in. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8297.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8300.8s)]
*  Am I making you nervous? [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8301.8s)]
*  She has acted in more than 30 films, and her first ones, like Gia, about a drug-addicted fashion model, felt edgy and real. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8303.8s)]
*  Angelina, whose actor parents broke up before she was one, experimented with drugs and a few other things early in her life. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8312.8s)]
*  She says she used those experiences to get into her roles. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8321.8s)]
*  It's good to be home. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8325.8s)]
*  She won an Oscar for her chilling portrait of a schizophrenic in Girl, Interrupted. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8327.8s)]
*  Later, she switched gears as Laura Croft, a character from a video game in Tomb Raider. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8334.8s)]
*  Dodging bullets. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8340.8s)]
*  And played a spy, Mrs. Smith, to Brad Pitt's Mr. Smith. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8341.8s)]
*  You were once asked if you wanted to play a Bond girl, and you said, nope. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8347.8s)]
*  You wanted to play Bond. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8354.8s)]
*  Well, you didn't play Bond, but you played a Bond-like character in Salt. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8356.8s)]
*  Is that one of your ambitions, to punch through these gender stereotypes? [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8361.8s)]
*  It's not something I intentionally did, but when it comes my way, and I'm aware of it, it was really fun to do. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8365.8s)]
*  Especially because I just had kids. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8370.8s)]
*  I just had my twins, and I'd been in the nightgown for about seven months, and I felt like getting up and punching something. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8372.8s)]
*  Her favorite movie was not an action flick, but a tragedy based on a true story. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8379.8s)]
*  In A Mighty Heart, Angelina plays Marianne Pearl, the widow of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who is beheaded by terrorists in Pakistan. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8384.8s)]
*  No! No! [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8394.8s)]
*  That was a moment I'll never forget. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8400.8s)]
*  That was the hardest thing, yeah. As an actress, that was the hardest thing. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8402.8s)]
*  Many of her films earned her more money than praise. Critics have often been tough. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8408.8s)]
*  But some directors rave about her. Clint Eastwood said she's a great talent hampered only by the fact that she has, quote, [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8413.8s)]
*  the most gorgeous face on the planet. That face has sold a lot of handbags and magazines. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8421.8s)]
*  But early on, Angelina Jolie flirted with a very different career. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8427.8s)]
*  You wanted to be a funeral director. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8433.8s)]
*  Mm-hmm, I did. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8435.8s)]
*  And you even took courses to prepare yourself. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8437.8s)]
*  It sounds like this very strange, eccentric, dark thing to do, but in fact, I lost my grandfather, and I was very upset with his funeral. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8440.8s)]
*  And so we discussed that maybe there are ways where this whole idea of how somebody passes and how a family deals with this passing [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8449.8s)]
*  and what death is should be addressed in a different way. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8457.8s)]
*  If this acting thing didn't work out, that that was going to be my backup. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8460.8s)]
*  She can joke about it now, but there were other times, scary and dangerous times, that she told us were not funny at all. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8465.8s)]
*  I went through heavy, darker times, and I survived them. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8473.8s)]
*  I didn't die young, so I'm very lucky. There are other artists and people that didn't survive certain things. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8477.8s)]
*  Talk about heavy, darker times. What are you referring to? [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8483.8s)]
*  I was hoping you'd miss that. Nothing I want to go into a lot of detail about, but I think people can imagine that I did the most dangerous and I did the worst, [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8488.8s)]
*  and for many reasons I shouldn't be here. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8497.8s)]
*  That's a very provocative phrase, for many reasons. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8500.8s)]
*  Well, sir, you just think that those too many times where you came close to too many dangerous things, too many chances taken, too far. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8503.8s)]
*  Her odd behavior was out there for everyone to see. The intimate way she kissed her brother in public, [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8513.8s)]
*  the vials of blood she and her second husband, Billy Bob Thornton, wore around their necks. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8520.8s)]
*  Angelina acknowledges she's taken quite a walk on the wild side, but says she's moved on. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8526.8s)]
*  I'm Angie. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8532.8s)]
*  In recent years, she has been traveling the world as a goodwill ambassador for the UN. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8534.8s)]
*  She's visited more than 20 countries, primarily to work with refugees. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8539.8s)]
*  You used to be a pretty bad girl. Now you are a UN ambassador. You are a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8544.8s)]
*  You are a humanitarian activist. Do you ever miss being a bad girl? [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8551.8s)]
*  I'm still a bad girl. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8556.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8558.8s)]
*  You know, I still have that side of me that is, it's just, it's in its place now. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8559.8s)]
*  It belongs, you know, it belongs to Brad or it belongs to our adventures. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8564.8s)]
*  Angelina and Brad Pitt have had three children together. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8571.8s)]
*  She also adopted three from three different countries, Cambodia, Ethiopia and Vietnam. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8575.8s)]
*  The tabloids have the couple splitting up one week, getting married the next. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8581.8s)]
*  Angelina told us they have no plans to get married. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8586.8s)]
*  The vast majority of Americans know you because you're on the cover of magazines every week [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8590.8s)]
*  and every time they go to a supermarket, they see you. What are they missing? [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8597.8s)]
*  Me. I don't see those things. I don't know what they are, but I assume they're not me. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8601.8s)]
*  Sure you do. You know what they are. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8606.8s)]
*  They're not who I am. They're not what I spend my day caring about. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8607.8s)]
*  I find them quite shallow and often very wrong when I do hear about what they are. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8610.8s)]
*  But they make it impossible for her to do anything in public. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8614.8s)]
*  Even in Budapest, we could only lunch with her in the private room of a restaurant. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8618.8s)]
*  When you're Angelina Jolie, though, there's no such thing as private. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8622.8s)]
*  Take her tortured relationship with her father, the actor John Voight. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8626.8s)]
*  He actually went on television and said his daughter had serious mental problems. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8631.8s)]
*  That even shocked Hollywood. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8637.8s)]
*  For years, Angelina refused to talk to her father. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8639.8s)]
*  After her mother died, she started seeing him again. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8643.8s)]
*  But she gives her mother, Marceline Bertrand, all the credit for where she is today. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8646.8s)]
*  Your mother's a beautiful woman. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8652.8s)]
*  She is. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8654.8s)]
*  You're pretty chubby. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8655.8s)]
*  I was all cheeks. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8657.8s)]
*  Big lips. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8659.8s)]
*  Big lips. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8660.8s)]
*  Angelina also says it was her mom who taught her how to raise her own kids. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8661.8s)]
*  At the house Angelina's renting in Budapest, we weren't allowed to film her children, [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8666.8s)]
*  unless you call Jacques one of her kids. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8671.8s)]
*  He seemed to love the camera almost as much as the camera loves Angelina. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8674.8s)]
*  He likes you. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8679.8s)]
*  You're here because Brad is shooting a film here. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8680.8s)]
*  You're not shooting a film? [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8683.8s)]
*  No, we never work at the same time. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8684.8s)]
*  What's better when Brad is working and you're with the kids [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8686.8s)]
*  or when you're working and Brad is with the kids? [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8689.8s)]
*  When I'm home with the kids. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8691.8s)]
*  But a lot of full-time parents would love to be shooting movies. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8692.8s)]
*  Yes, they would because it's easier. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8695.8s)]
*  My mother was a full-time mother. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8697.8s)]
*  She didn't have much of her own career, her own life, her own experiences, [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8700.8s)]
*  her own, you know, everything was for her children. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8704.8s)]
*  And do you try to be the same kind of mom that she was? [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8707.8s)]
*  I will never be as good a mother as she was. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8711.8s)]
*  I will try my best, but I don't think I could ever be. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8713.8s)]
*  She was just grace incarnate. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8716.8s)]
*  She was the most generous, loving... [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8719.8s)]
*  She's better than me. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8727.8s)]
*  It's clear that you can talk about anything but your mother without dwelling up. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8729.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8734.8s)]
*  That's my soft spot. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8737.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8740.8s)]
*  Angelina's biggest regret is that her mother won't be there [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8745.8s)]
*  for the premiere of In the Land of Blood and Honey, [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8748.8s)]
*  a film she suspects won't have the commercial appeal of anything she's done. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8751.8s)]
*  It's going to open soon. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8756.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8758.8s)]
*  Nervous? [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8759.8s)]
*  I am nervous that people are going to not understand it. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8760.8s)]
*  Right now, if you had to decide that in six months you're going to [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8763.8s)]
*  either act in a film or direct a film, what would you do? [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8766.8s)]
*  I'd prefer directing. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8770.8s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8772.8s)]
*  Yeah. I loved having the spotlight on somebody else, [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8773.8s)]
*  and I would much prefer it. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8775.8s)]
*  Angelina's already writing and planning to direct another war film about Afghanistan, [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8777.8s)]
*  and she knows, as a director, her beauty and her acting skills won't be worth a nickel. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8783.8s)]
*  It's nice. It's nice for all of that not to matter. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8789.8s)]
*  It's also risky. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8793.8s)]
*  Is it? I mean, I think what's risky is living your life and never trying for anything [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8795.8s)]
*  and never doing something brave and never getting yourself scared and... [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8800.8s)]
*  Are you scared? [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8804.8s)]
*  In a good way. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8806.8s)]
*  For the record, it's iron ore, but it's easy to make the case that Australia's leading export is acting talent. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8808.8s)]
*  How has an island of only 27 million people minted Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8824.8s)]
*  Cate Blanchett, Mel Gibson, Margot Robbie, Chris Hemsworth... [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8830.8s)]
*  We can keep going here. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8833.8s)]
*  Sarah Snook, Russell Crowe, Heath Ledger, Naomi Watts... [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8835.8s)]
*  to say nothing of so many Oscar-winning directors, designers and crew. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8838.8s)]
*  We headed to the bottom of the globe and then other spots on the globe to explore the Aussie takeover. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8841.8s)]
*  We met stars, we heard theories, and in a quiet Sydney neighborhood, [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8847.8s)]
*  impossibly far and away from Hollywood, we found a place that pumps out talent. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8851.8s)]
*  Seen, London's West End, its theater district, [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8859.8s)]
*  Sarah Snook is fresh off her Emmy-winning breakthrough role as Shiv Roy, [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8862.8s)]
*  Well, it's not all about you. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8867.8s)]
*  the vicious yet vulnerable daughter in the HBO show Succession. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8869.8s)]
*  If only I could remain always young. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8873.8s)]
*  For her next act, she's upped the degree of difficulty and pivoted from TV to live performance, [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8875.8s)]
*  playing all 26 roles in an innovative multimedia staging of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8881.8s)]
*  a theatrical sensation coming soon to Broadway. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8888.8s)]
*  I would give my soul for that. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8891.8s)]
*  It's not unheard of for someone to have a successful run in TV or film and then go do theater. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8893.8s)]
*  I'm not sure I've seen someone do 26 roles of theater at once. What are you thinking? [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8899.8s)]
*  You know, it's an incredible play, an incredible opportunity to be able to play so many different roles and so many different characters. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8904.8s)]
*  And you know, it's that thing of you come off some of the best writing in the world, what do you do next? [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8911.8s)]
*  Something has to be out there to challenge you, and this certainly is the challenge. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8915.8s)]
*  If it's an unusual bit of career management, it's also on brand as the kind of daring move you would expect from a modern Australian star. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8922.8s)]
*  What is going through your head during this performance with all of these marks and rolls and lines and angles? [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8931.8s)]
*  Nothing, which is quite nice. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8938.8s)]
*  Really? [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8941.8s)]
*  The focus required is a kind of a state of meditative flow in a way, [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8942.8s)]
*  because if I'm sitting there going, oh, am I on my mark? Am I doing this? [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8949.8s)]
*  Then the next line has happened. So if I think about anything else, then I'm stitched up. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8953.8s)]
*  Stitched up? That's Aussie for in a jam. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8958.8s)]
*  Didn't know Sarah Snook was Australian? [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8961.8s)]
*  You're pathetic. You're a masochist and you can't even take it. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8963.8s)]
*  If you couldn't have guessed by the accent... [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8966.8s)]
*  This way, over here. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8968.8s)]
*  ...if you didn't get to that soon, you might have guessed it by simply playing the percentages. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8970.8s)]
*  And more goes straight down the center. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8974.8s)]
*  Name an A-list star of the stage or screen today. Odds are blooming good. They come from the land down under. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8976.8s)]
*  There are a lot of you, aren't there? [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8983.8s)]
*  Yeah, there's a few of us out there. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8984.8s)]
*  Here's this country. Fewer people in Texas. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8986.8s)]
*  Is it? Really? Stop it. Really? Pretty good ratio. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8989.8s)]
*  I was going to say, you guys are doing pretty well for yourself, aren't you? [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8993.8s)]
*  Yeah, not so bad. Not so bad. Huh. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8995.8s)]
*  Jake! [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8997.8s)]
*  Yes, they are everywhere, these Aussies. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=8999.8s)]
*  Filling up IMDb pages and call sheets. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9001.8s)]
*  How are you? [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9005.8s)]
*  Yes! This is what I was supposed to do. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9007.8s)]
*  They've brought us her and him. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9010.8s)]
*  Don't touch my things. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9013.8s)]
*  Him too. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9017.8s)]
*  Are you not entertained? [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9018.8s)]
*  Heroes. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9019.8s)]
*  Upon this moment. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9020.8s)]
*  And villains. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9022.8s)]
*  Why so serious? [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9023.8s)]
*  Earning top billings. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9026.8s)]
*  A real actress. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9027.8s)]
*  I'm a thistle-sifter. I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9029.8s)]
*  Earning top awards. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9033.8s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9035.8s)]
*  I have such appreciation. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9036.8s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9038.8s)]
*  I'm an Australian who played an Australian in a movie called... [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9039.8s)]
*  Aussies. They've become to Hollywood what Kenyans are to marathoning. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9042.8s)]
*  Wildly overrepresented. And not just in front of the camera. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9046.8s)]
*  I need a moment. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9050.8s)]
*  And... action. Fade in. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9051.8s)]
*  Take filmmaker Baz Luhrmann. A singular creative force. Almost a genre unto himself. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9056.8s)]
*  He spoke to us from a far-flung location where he was scouting his next film. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9061.8s)]
*  It's got to a point where there are so many Australian performers and actors behind the screen. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9066.8s)]
*  I mean screenplay, writing and directing. But particularly with actors. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9074.8s)]
*  That even I have to be told, oh you know X is Australian. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9077.8s)]
*  I mean, oh I didn't know that. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9081.8s)]
*  Because they are really everywhere. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9083.8s)]
*  Now NIDA was a really big part of that because I think it kind of set the culture and set the attitude. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9085.8s)]
*  NIDA. The National Institute of Dramatic Art. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9094.8s)]
*  Think of it as the Julliard of Australia. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9097.8s)]
*  Up through the sky. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9100.8s)]
*  Its rise to prominence marks a major plot point in the Aussie cinematic invasion. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9101.8s)]
*  The acceptance rate is barely 2%. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9106.8s)]
*  Naomi Watts and Hugh Jackman were among those declined. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9109.8s)]
*  Baz Luhrmann was class of 1985. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9112.8s)]
*  Sarah Snook class of 2008. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9115.8s)]
*  One of only 24 admitted students that year. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9118.8s)]
*  At NIDA, Snook received training in the classics, experimental theater and also picked up some hacks. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9121.8s)]
*  I was told I had to ask you about how you cried during check-off during the Three Sisters performance. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9127.8s)]
*  We told you that. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9133.8s)]
*  We've got our sources. We do our research here. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9134.8s)]
*  Yeah, there were a few of us who were nervous about having to instantaneously produce tears. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9138.8s)]
*  And so we were very cheeky and would put Tiger Balm on a little handkerchief. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9147.8s)]
*  And when we were behind a particular screen we would just put the Tiger Balm in our eyes. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9153.8s)]
*  And so they would have very red eyes and look very upset to cry for Russia. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9158.8s)]
*  You can't be CEO. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9164.8s)]
*  You can't because you killed someone. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9166.8s)]
*  At less risk to her health, there she also learned to mask that charming Aussie accent. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9168.8s)]
*  How often do you get, she's Australian? [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9174.8s)]
*  I do, yeah, frequently. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9177.8s)]
*  Is that something they taught you at NIDA at all? [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9179.8s)]
*  Yeah, accent work at NIDA, British accents, American accents. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9181.8s)]
*  I think that's one more thing you've got to think about. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9185.8s)]
*  Not just your lines and not just your work. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9187.8s)]
*  No, I know. That was the thing on the show. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9190.8s)]
*  There was often times where we had to improvise. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9192.8s)]
*  And so I had to try and think in an American accent as well, which is tricky. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9196.8s)]
*  Lerman too still leans on his NIDA training. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9202.8s)]
*  The National Institute of Dramatic Art, the drama school I went to, I mean I do remember one thing, [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9206.8s)]
*  and I think it's sort of an Australian attitude, which is don't wait for permission to be told that you can act. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9212.8s)]
*  We were taught to devise things. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9219.8s)]
*  We were taught not to sit around and, okay, there's the play, that's your part, you may be in it. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9221.8s)]
*  We were taught to make up story, get with friends, make a show, create something. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9227.8s)]
*  I had an idea that I would take the Greek myth and with a bunch of friends devise it [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9233.8s)]
*  and set it in the world of ballroom dancing while I was at the National Institute of Dramatic Art. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9240.8s)]
*  That little play went for about 30 minutes. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9245.8s)]
*  It was called Strictly Ballroom. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9247.8s)]
*  Within a few years, Lerman had turned that little play into a worldwide film, [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9251.8s)]
*  a cult hit with all Aussie cast and crew. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9256.8s)]
*  That was 1992. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9259.8s)]
*  Then Australia was still a theatrical outback of sorts. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9261.8s)]
*  True, Errol Flynn was born in Tasmania, but Australia's contribution to the silver screen extended not much beyond, well, this. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9266.8s)]
*  That's a noise. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9276.8s)]
*  Then the NIDA talent started filtering out. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9278.8s)]
*  Mel Gibson. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9281.8s)]
*  Hey, you want to see crazy? I'll see you. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9282.8s)]
*  Kate Blanchett. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9284.8s)]
*  Excuse me, is Queenie here? [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9286.8s)]
*  Because nobody admits anything they've done! [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9288.8s)]
*  Tony Collette. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9290.8s)]
*  Baz Luhrmann's wife, the four-time Oscar-winning costume and production designer Catherine Martin, is another NIDA grad. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9292.8s)]
*  Help us understand where NIDA fits into the broader entertainment industry. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9299.8s)]
*  That can-do, will-tell, you know, don't-wait-for-permission attitude that NIDA instilled in the very first graduates. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9305.8s)]
*  That spilled out into the kind of larger sense of what it was to be, you know, a performer in Australia. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9315.8s)]
*  You know, just throwing yourself off the cliff and flying. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9324.8s)]
*  We didn't want it to be... [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9331.8s)]
*  In Sydney, we found the godfather, the guru. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9333.8s)]
*  Now 92, John Clark was NIDA's all-powerful director for 35 years, starting in 1969. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9336.8s)]
*  He set a goal from the start, developing and unlocking a distinct Aussie mode of acting, marrying the Theatre of London with Hollywood gloss. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9344.8s)]
*  We thought the method acting was having such an influence, and everybody was emoting, and the style of acting was terribly emotional and lacking in skill and imagination. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9353.8s)]
*  So we thought, no, we've got to find a way of doing it that takes the best of America and the best of Britain, but allows our own national characteristics to develop. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9368.8s)]
*  What makes Australian acting unique? [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9381.8s)]
*  Skill, confidence, courage, and enjoyment of the body. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9384.8s)]
*  And NIDA's never encouraged self-indulgence or show-off acting. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9391.8s)]
*  The actors who have done well in Hollywood, they are not acting with a capital A. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9397.8s)]
*  They are playing characters with such conviction and with such truth, without what Australians would call decoration or bullsh-t. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9402.8s)]
*  Beautiful. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9414.8s)]
*  It's straight down the middle, and they do their homework. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9416.8s)]
*  They're highly intelligent. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9419.8s)]
*  Mr. Anderson, welcome by. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9421.8s)]
*  And they know who the person is. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9423.8s)]
*  They're playing. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9426.8s)]
*  You like what I've done with the place? [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9427.8s)]
*  In addition to running NIDA, John Clark co-founded the Sydney Theatre Company, a harborside band box where NIDA students can launch careers and established stars can come back home to get back to basics. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9430.8s)]
*  You drew me, didn't you? [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9443.8s)]
*  Yet another supporting role in this story? [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9444.8s)]
*  Aussie soap operas. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9447.8s)]
*  Seriously, don't judge. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9448.8s)]
*  The soaps enable actors to sharpen their skills day in, day out before their call-ups. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9450.8s)]
*  Did the cops talk to you? [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9455.8s)]
*  Australia has all these institutions, NIDA, Sydney Theatre Company, the soaps. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9457.8s)]
*  What contributions do they make to this over-representation of Aussies that we see? [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9462.8s)]
*  A good training ground. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9468.8s)]
*  Australia's got great training grounds for international work. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9469.8s)]
*  There's a way you can test yourself in Australia, and you can fail safely in a way, and I think fail is really important, to see your limits and to help grow. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9472.8s)]
*  Hardly a child star, Snook grew up as a typical Aussie free-range kid. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9480.8s)]
*  You're telling me about your upbringing. You're riding a bike in the National Park in southern Australia with kangaroos. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9485.8s)]
*  I feel like that's a real grounding force in my life, having that independent play in sort of risky areas that breeds a lot of self-reliance in a kid. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9492.8s)]
*  These experiences you had on the other side of the world actually really help you. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9502.8s)]
*  They build your character so that you can play other characters. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9507.8s)]
*  For all of the pathways in infrastructure, there's something else about Aussies, and there's probably a lesson here for all of us. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9511.8s)]
*  Simply put, they're the anti-divas, doing drama, not bringing drama to work. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9518.8s)]
*  The things that I really respect about the Australian actors that I love overseas, there is a bit of an understanding that it's all oftentimes smoke and mirrors. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9524.8s)]
*  It's fun, it's a game, and it is profound in some ways, but it's also silly. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9535.8s)]
*  Chris Hemsworth has got a great tongue-in-cheek attitude about it all. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9541.8s)]
*  And also Baz Luhrmann, his films tend to have a little cheeker, a wink to the audience. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9545.8s)]
*  The phrase in heavy rotation, we kept hearing those Aussies, they take the work seriously, they don't take themselves particularly seriously. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9551.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. That's what it is. A much better way of saying what I just said. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9558.8s)]
*  Finally, about that distance. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9564.8s)]
*  Baz Luhrmann believes that the remoteness of Australia, a place where actors can stretch their talents and horizons beyond the gaze of Hollywood tastemakers, is in fact a blessing. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9566.8s)]
*  The one thing everyone agrees about with Australia is that it's far, far away. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9578.8s)]
*  And I think that we still think that the idea of being either in a movie or in a play on Broadway or in a television show in Hollywood is still a romantic notion. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9583.8s)]
*  It's still a privilege. It isn't a job. It's a dream. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9596.8s)]
*  If you feel like you're seeing a lot of Samuel L. Jackson lately, it's not your imagination. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9600.8s)]
*  He seems to be everywhere. There are the credit card commercials, the movie trailers, not to mention a hundred or so of his films circulating on cable TV. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9614.8s)]
*  He's been around for a long time and, as you might suspect, is quite a character, someone we thought would be fun to hang out with. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9624.8s)]
*  If you know him only from his films, there are things in this story that will probably surprise you. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9631.8s)]
*  He spent 15 years on the stage in New York and didn't become a movie star until his mid-forties. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9637.8s)]
*  He's been with the same woman, also a distinguished actor, for nearly 50 years. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9643.8s)]
*  And the movies he's been in have grossed more money than any other actor's films in the history of Hollywood. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9648.8s)]
*  And nobody likes to watch them more than he does. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9655.8s)]
*  Do you watch your movies? [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9659.8s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9660.8s)]
*  You like seeing yourself on screen? [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9661.8s)]
*  I do. When I was doing theater in New York, I always wanted to see the play I was in with me in it. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9663.8s)]
*  Hard to do. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9669.8s)]
*  Yeah, it is. Very difficult. So this was perfect for me. I get to watch my performances. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9670.8s)]
*  I always think that, oh, I can't stand to watch myself. It's like some bulls**t. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9676.8s)]
*  So I was like, really? So watch me business. And if you can't watch it, why should people pay $13.50 to watch you do it? [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9680.8s)]
*  At age 70, when most A-list actors find it hard to get work, Samuel L. Jackson is very much in demand. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9690.8s)]
*  I got my eye on you. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9697.8s)]
*  He has two movies out right now, Glass and Captain Marvel, that have already grossed more than a billion dollars. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9699.8s)]
*  You famous or something? [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9706.8s)]
*  His career has allowed him to be all sorts of different people. A bounty hunter. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9707.8s)]
*  A computer engineer at Jurassic Park. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9715.8s)]
*  Hold on to your butts. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9718.8s)]
*  I ain't going nowhere until you give me some money. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9720.8s)]
*  A junkie, a Jedi Master. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9725.8s)]
*  And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and... [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9730.8s)]
*  And a Bible-quoting hitman in Pulp Fiction, all the while stealing scenes and sometimes entire movies while garnering critical acclaim. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9734.8s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. Did I break your concentration? [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9743.8s)]
*  I got nominated for an Academy Award, but like I tell people, winning or losing an Academy Award doesn't do a lot toward moving the comma on your check. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9746.8s)]
*  What moves the comma on your check? [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9757.8s)]
*  Buts and seats. Selling tickets. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9759.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9762.8s)]
*  If you're in a movie and nobody goes to see it, it's like, yeah, Academy Award winner. Yeah, I don't want to see that. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9763.8s)]
*  You know, you go to movies because people do exciting movies or you like the characters that they do. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9769.8s)]
*  First and foremost, Sam Jackson is a performer, an entertainer, in real life and on the screen. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9775.8s)]
*  He creates memorable characters. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9781.8s)]
*  Strong, opinionated, sometimes scary people, often with a wicked sense of humor. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9785.8s)]
*  It's more than a persona or a brand. It's almost a whole genre. Raw, honest, incredible. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9792.8s)]
*  I like to play characters that express themselves verbally. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9799.8s)]
*  So I'm always looking to tell people who I am and not specifically just show them. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9805.8s)]
*  And that's just a natural quality. Is that Sam Jackson? [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9812.8s)]
*  I think it is. I don't necessarily care about whether I'm liked or not. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9815.8s)]
*  And I think I've found interesting ways of making bad guys, guys that people like. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9820.8s)]
*  How do you do that? [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9829.8s)]
*  You try and keep people as human as you possibly can keep them until they have to do the thing that they have to do. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9830.8s)]
*  And that's your genre? [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9837.8s)]
*  I hope so. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9839.8s)]
*  He grew up in Chattanooga, Tennessee, not far from the Walnut Street Bridge. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9841.8s)]
*  His grandmother told him stories about black people being lynched there. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9846.8s)]
*  We used to ride our bicycles down this hill, Third Street. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9850.8s)]
*  It was the totally segregated Jim Crow South. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9853.8s)]
*  Everywhere he went and everyone he knew was black. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9856.8s)]
*  His neighborhood, his schools, his teachers, and the experience still colors his life. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9860.8s)]
*  So I grew up in this world, which is the street world. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9865.8s)]
*  All these kids whose parents were domestics or worked in what was known as the chicken house, [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9868.8s)]
*  where they killed chickens and packaged chickens and stuff like that, [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9874.8s)]
*  there were a mixture of kids who were in and out of reform school. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9877.8s)]
*  We came from a place that was kind of well-versed in learning to live life as it came at you. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9881.8s)]
*  He was raised by his grandparents, a janitor and a housemaid who had a strong work ethic. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9888.8s)]
*  His mother, who held down a secure, well-paying government job in Washington, D.C., [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9895.8s)]
*  was a constant presence in his life, spending summers, holidays, and some weekends with him, [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9900.8s)]
*  helping him navigate the world as a young black man. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9906.8s)]
*  You knew what the rules were. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9910.8s)]
*  When people got ready to do stuff that was going to get them sent to jail, I just went home. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9912.8s)]
*  I understood. My mom said, we're not getting you out of jail. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9917.8s)]
*  If you get arrested, don't call me. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9920.8s)]
*  I had a greater fear of the people that I lived with who provided for me than I did of being your friend [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9924.8s)]
*  and hanging out with you and doing something stupid that's going to get me in trouble. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9930.8s)]
*  Sam Jackson was an excellent student and in 1966 went off to study biology at Morehouse College, [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9933.8s)]
*  the alma mater of Martin Luther King, Jr., an historically black college in Atlanta, [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9940.8s)]
*  which was one of the headquarters of the civil rights movement. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9945.8s)]
*  Like many young people in the 1960s, he discovered his rebellious side on campus. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9948.8s)]
*  He became heavily involved in the civil rights movement and protested against the Vietnam War. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9953.8s)]
*  Did you consider yourself to be a radical when you were here? [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9959.8s)]
*  No. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9962.8s)]
*  I mean, you got thrown out for occupying the president's office, didn't you? [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9963.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9967.8s)]
*  But... [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9968.8s)]
*  That's pretty involved. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9969.8s)]
*  That's just one day in life, you know? [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9970.8s)]
*  After being chastened by his mother for getting in trouble and hanging out with the wrong people, [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9974.8s)]
*  Jackson returned to Morehouse two years later, having decided that biology required too much math [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9979.8s)]
*  and dramatic arts was much more fun. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9985.8s)]
*  This is where you did your first work? [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9988.8s)]
*  Yes, this was where it all started. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9990.8s)]
*  It was one of the first times during my college experience I was anxious to get up and be somewhere. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=9992.8s)]
*  Still the same? [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10000.8s)]
*  Oh, totally. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10001.8s)]
*  Totally, yeah. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10002.8s)]
*  I mean, going to a rehearsal or going to work or being in a movie set is my favorite thing to do. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10003.8s)]
*  But probably the most significant thing to happen to Sam Jackson in Atlanta was meeting LaTonya Richardson, [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10010.8s)]
*  a talented fellow student actor at Spelman College. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10016.8s)]
*  She found him flamboyant, self-involved, and emotionally detached, [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10020.8s)]
*  but she may have been the first to appreciate his potential. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10025.8s)]
*  They have been together for 48 years, and LaTonya Richardson Jackson is currently starring on Broadway [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10029.8s)]
*  in To Kill a Mockingbird. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10035.8s)]
*  What's it like being married to Sam Jackson? [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10037.8s)]
*  Oh, God, oh, God. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10040.8s)]
*  It's a ride. It's been a ride. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10043.8s)]
*  It's fun. It's sad. It's happy. It's creative. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10046.8s)]
*  It's a conversation. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10056.8s)]
*  I hope so. 48 years is a long time. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10059.8s)]
*  Yeah, it is, mixed with a lot of amnesia. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10061.8s)]
*  They would spend 15 years in New York as struggling stage actors, raising a daughter, Zoe, [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10065.8s)]
*  and keeping company with a small community of other struggling black actors [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10071.8s)]
*  that included Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Lawrence Fishburne, and Wesley Snipes. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10076.8s)]
*  We would go and watch each other work. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10082.8s)]
*  We'd party together. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10084.8s)]
*  When you weren't working, everybody had the same unemployment office pretty much, [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10086.8s)]
*  so you'd see each other on Mondays and Unemployment. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10090.8s)]
*  By 1990, Jackson was an established New York actor, having played memorable characters [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10093.8s)]
*  in three Spike Lee movies, including Do the Right Thing. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10099.8s)]
*  I have today's forecast for you. Hot! [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10104.8s)]
*  But personally, his life was a mess. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10111.8s)]
*  He had some drug and alcohol issues. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10114.8s)]
*  There weren't issues till the end. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10117.8s)]
*  What do you mean the end? [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10120.8s)]
*  You know, I wasn't managing it as well as I used to. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10123.8s)]
*  That's when there were issues. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10127.8s)]
*  Before that, it was just life. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10129.8s)]
*  You know, I drank, I smoked, I got high. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10131.8s)]
*  It wasn't in the way of my life in that way, or I didn't think it was. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10135.8s)]
*  He was going to work, taking his daughter to school, [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10139.8s)]
*  and making enough money to develop a taste for cocaine, and he went all in. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10142.8s)]
*  Did it reach addiction stage? [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10147.8s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, it's hard to smoke cocaine and not get addicted. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10149.8s)]
*  Smoking cocaine will bring you to your knees pretty quick. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10153.8s)]
*  It ended one night on the kitchen floor. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10155.8s)]
*  And I bought the cocaine, I went home, I cooked it, [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10158.8s)]
*  and when I woke up, Latanya was standing over me, [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10161.8s)]
*  and I was passed out on the floor, and I never got to smoking. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10165.8s)]
*  The next day I was in rehab. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10168.8s)]
*  Did you go to rehab because you wanted to or needed to, [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10170.8s)]
*  or because Latanya told you you had to? [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10173.8s)]
*  You know, I didn't go kicking and screaming. I was tired. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10175.8s)]
*  Could you have done it without her? [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10178.8s)]
*  I credit her because she could have just taken Zoe and walked out [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10181.8s)]
*  and been done with me, but she didn't. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10185.8s)]
*  That's a greater love than I will ever know. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10189.8s)]
*  Because I don't know that I would have done that. [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10194.8s)]
*  Do you think that Latanya saved your life? [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10197.8s)]
*  Yeah. No doubt. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10199.8s)]
*  You don't seem emotionally detached now. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10205.8s)]
*  Am I crying? [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10208.8s)]
*  No. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10209.8s)]
*  Oh, okay, good. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10210.8s)]
*  He said you saved his life. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10215.8s)]
*  No, I didn't. He saved his life. He and God saved his life. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10217.8s)]
*  I have no saving, healing power. I was just there. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10221.8s)]
*  In any event, it changed Jackson's life and his career. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10226.8s)]
*  I'm a crackhead. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10230.8s)]
*  While he was in rehab, he got a call from Spike Lee offering him [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10234.8s)]
*  the role of drug addigator purify in Jungle Fever. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10237.8s)]
*  So I'm in rehab, and the call comes and told me, [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10241.8s)]
*  Jungle Fever, crackhead. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10248.8s)]
*  I'm like, okay, good. I'm doing the research. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10252.8s)]
*  I'm right here. So I'm ready to do it. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10254.8s)]
*  And that was it. That's what opened the door. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10257.8s)]
*  That's what got me into Hollywood. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10259.8s)]
*  Yo, baby. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10261.8s)]
*  The role won Jackson a special award at the Cannes Film Festival [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10263.8s)]
*  for best supporting actor. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10266.8s)]
*  And Gator became this cathartic kind of thing for me. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10268.8s)]
*  It was basically killing off who I was, who I had been, [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10272.8s)]
*  that allowed me to free myself to go and do these other things. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10275.8s)]
*  I got me a handgun. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10279.8s)]
*  Those other things take up ten pages on the movie site IMDb, [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10283.8s)]
*  a half a dozen films with Quentin Tarantino, The Avengers, [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10287.8s)]
*  three Star Wars films, and scores of lesser features [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10291.8s)]
*  in which he was better than the material. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10298.8s)]
*  Besides scary eyes, he has a facility for language, especially profanity. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10300.8s)]
*  No, Yolanda, Yolanda, he ain't gonna do a god-d***, [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10305.8s)]
*  that mother-f***ing thing. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10307.8s)]
*  Obscenities roll off his tongue like Shakespeare from Olivier, [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10309.8s)]
*  even if you bleep the words. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10312.8s)]
*  What's your favorite line? [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10314.8s)]
*  I like the say what again line, or do they speak English in what? [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10316.8s)]
*  What country you from? [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10321.8s)]
*  What? What? [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10323.8s)]
*  What ain't no country I ever heard of? [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10324.8s)]
*  They speak English in what? [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10326.8s)]
*  English, mother-f***er, do you speak it? [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10328.8s)]
*  Do you think it's the line or the way you say it? [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10331.8s)]
*  I think there's a wrong way to say everything, [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10333.8s)]
*  and I think I've found ways to say things right that make people remember them [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10337.8s)]
*  or resonate in the correct way. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10341.8s)]
*  Directors praise his preparation, professionalism, and work ethic, [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10344.8s)]
*  and almost always give him wide berth with his performance, [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10348.8s)]
*  but he's not always entirely flexible. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10351.8s)]
*  So if a director wants you to do something you don't think would be good for you [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10354.8s)]
*  or good for the film, you won't do it? [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10358.8s)]
*  No, pretty much. [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10360.8s)]
*  They understand that when they hire you? [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10361.8s)]
*  Some people think that they can overcome it, [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10363.8s)]
*  that we can come to a compromise, and they'll go, [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10365.8s)]
*  look, I get what you're doing and I understand it, [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10368.8s)]
*  but can we try this other thing one time? [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10371.8s)]
*  No, we can't, because if I do it one time and it's on film, [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10374.8s)]
*  when you go to the editing room, that's the thing you like, [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10379.8s)]
*  that's the first thing you're going to look at, not the logical thing that I did. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10381.8s)]
*  So let's just not do what you want to do so you don't have that option. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10385.8s)]
*  His mantra has always been, what does the audience want to see? [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10389.8s)]
*  And then he tries to give it to them. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10393.8s)]
*  That's what I was taught when I was doing theater, [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10396.8s)]
*  that when you come on stage, you want to light it up to the point [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10399.8s)]
*  that when you leave, people want to go with you. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10403.8s)]
*  And I hope that's who I am when I show up. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10407.8s)]
*  With the primetime Emmys following right on our heels tonight, [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10420.8s)]
*  there's a good chance that you'll see almost as much of Jerry Seinfeld [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10424.8s)]
*  in the next few hours as we're going to show you now. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10427.8s)]
*  When NBC began first talking to Jerry Seinfeld about doing an offbeat television series, [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10430.8s)]
*  he was a moderately successful stand-up comic, [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10435.8s)]
*  and no one's expectations were very high. [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10438.8s)]
*  Today, eight years and 150 episodes later, a lot of things have changed, like television. [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10440.8s)]
*  As we first reported last February, that's in large part because of Seinfeld. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10447.8s)]
*  Just look at the network's schedules. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10451.8s)]
*  There are half a dozen Seinfeld clones. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10453.8s)]
*  His offbeat show is the top-rated comedy on television. [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10455.8s)]
*  And every time the network runs a 30-second commercial on it, [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10459.8s)]
*  it earns more than a half a million dollars. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10462.8s)]
*  You may think that's a lot of money, but it's only a fraction [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10464.8s)]
*  of what Jerry Seinfeld will make from the series for the rest of his life. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10467.8s)]
*  It's his name on the soundstage and on the slate. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10474.8s)]
*  But he's the most relaxed man on the set. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10477.8s)]
*  In the history of television, only a handful of people have been as involved in a show [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10481.8s)]
*  or have gotten as rich from a show as Jerry Seinfeld has from this one. [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10486.8s)]
*  We can schedule him. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10491.8s)]
*  Nothing escapes his attention. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10493.8s)]
*  He's either writing a scene, watching a scene, or acting in a scene. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10496.8s)]
*  You get a check as a writer. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10503.8s)]
*  You get a check as an actor. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10505.8s)]
*  You get a check as a creator. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10508.8s)]
*  You get a check as an executive producer. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10510.8s)]
*  And you get checks every time one of these episodes is shown anywhere in the world. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10513.8s)]
*  And I get nothing for doing this. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10517.8s)]
*  Nothing. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10519.8s)]
*  In the show, he plays a self-effacing straight man in the midst of hopeless neurotics. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10521.8s)]
*  And in real life, he is a non-actor surrounded by one of the most talented casts ever to grace a sitcom. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10526.8s)]
*  Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Michael Richards are all good enough to have their own series. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10533.8s)]
*  And now, thanks in part to Jerry Seinfeld, they're about to be paid like they do. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10540.8s)]
*  And they'll tell you in no uncertain terms that Jerry Seinfeld's character is the least interesting on the show. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10545.8s)]
*  The focus is really the three of us. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10551.8s)]
*  How did that evolve? Or has it been that way from the beginning? [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10553.8s)]
*  We're just much better than he is, I would say. Would you agree? [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10556.8s)]
*  Is there a difference between Jerry Seinfeld, the character, and Jerry Seinfeld in real life? [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10559.8s)]
*  Jerry in real life has much more money than Jerry, the character. I'd say much more, actually. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10563.8s)]
*  I think that he's very compulsive. [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10569.8s)]
*  He wants to know where a pencil is. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10571.8s)]
*  He wants to know where the paper is. Here's his car keys, my jacket, and my whistle. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10573.8s)]
*  He just wants to know where everything is. I don't know if that's a sign of insanity. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10579.8s)]
*  In short, the real Jerry Seinfeld is very much like the television character, at least before he got the sitcom. [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10585.8s)]
*  Even his mother calls him Mr. Perfection. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10591.8s)]
*  He grew up in Massapequa, Long Island. His father ran a sign company. [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10594.8s)]
*  And on the day he graduated from Queens College, he took the subway to his first stand-up gig. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10598.8s)]
*  It is still his first love, although he performs now only on rare occasions. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10604.8s)]
*  Last July, we went with him to Atlanta. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10609.8s)]
*  Millions had come to see the Olympics, but the hottest ticket in town carried you through the metal detectors at the Fox Theater [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10612.8s)]
*  to watch Jerry Seinfeld perform his best event. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10619.8s)]
*  Yet backstage before the show, he seemed very much the wallflower at his own party. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10623.8s)]
*  What would you be doing if we weren't here? [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10628.8s)]
*  Just waiting. One of the things you have to do, you must master waiting as a comedian. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10630.8s)]
*  You must be able to just wait comfortably. [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10635.8s)]
*  They say the show's going to be delayed a half hour. You just go, fine. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10638.8s)]
*  The plane's going to be delayed two hours. Fine. Career's going to be delayed five years. Fine. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10641.8s)]
*  You've got to be able to wait. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10646.8s)]
*  Are you nervous now? [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10647.8s)]
*  Very, very nervous, because you're here. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10649.8s)]
*  And you're throwing me off. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10653.8s)]
*  Would you normally, are you nervous before you go out there? [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10657.8s)]
*  Steve. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10660.8s)]
*  Can I call you Steve? [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10663.8s)]
*  I'm in this 20 years, brother. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10666.8s)]
*  It's over. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10669.8s)]
*  What do you mean it's over? [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10670.8s)]
*  All the tension, the struggle. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10671.8s)]
*  I always wanted to be a comedian. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10674.8s)]
*  I always wanted to be a comedian. [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10676.8s)]
*  It's 20 years later. I am a comedian. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10677.8s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Jerry Seinfeld. [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10682.8s)]
*  He is not just a comedian. Right now, he is the comedian. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10686.8s)]
*  Aside from waiting tables at a brew burger in New York and selling cheap jewelry and umbrellas outside Bloomingdale's, [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10689.8s)]
*  this is the only job he's ever had. [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10696.8s)]
*  Making observations about life's little mysteries like seedless watermelons. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10698.8s)]
*  They've been working on this for 20 years. Scientists devoting their lives. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10702.8s)]
*  Other scientists working on AIDS, cancer, heart disease. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10709.8s)]
*  These guys are going, no, I feel melon is my area. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10711.8s)]
*  Yes, I know that thousands of people are dying needlessly, but this, that's got to stop. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10715.8s)]
*  How you doing, Jerry? [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10723.8s)]
*  At 42, he is at the top of the world, and no one seems more surprised than Jerry Seinfeld. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10724.8s)]
*  I never thought I'd see it. You know, when you, I had been doing comedy 15 years, 16 years. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10730.8s)]
*  I wasn't going anywhere. You know, this is it. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10736.8s)]
*  I got 45 minutes of observations about planes and cough syrup, and that's it. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10740.8s)]
*  I get away with that. I make a living. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10745.8s)]
*  And I thought, even if I ever did manage to get on TV, I'm not the kind of guy people get excited about, you know. [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10748.8s)]
*  I just do a nice, I'm like a good carpenter, you know. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10755.8s)]
*  I do nice detail work. You know, to me, Robin Williams, that's a star. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10758.8s)]
*  You know, I'm just thinking of myself as that kind of guy. [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10763.8s)]
*  And I'm not that kind of guy. [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10769.8s)]
*  NBC didn't think he was that kind of guy either. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10771.8s)]
*  They initially signed him because they were afraid some other network might hire him as a late night competitor for The Tonight Show. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10773.8s)]
*  They let him try a sitcom just to keep him busy, and preview audiences hated it. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10780.8s)]
*  The research report hangs on the wall of his home in Los Angeles. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10784.8s)]
*  This is the audience test on the pilot back in 1989. Pilot performance... [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10788.8s)]
*  Weak. Weak. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10794.8s)]
*  No segment of the audience was eager to watch the show again. [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10795.8s)]
*  Here's another great line. Viewers felt that Jerry needed a better backup ensemble. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10798.8s)]
*  Can you imagine a better backup ensemble in the world than those three people? [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10804.8s)]
*  In the end, NBC stuck its neck out and ordered four episodes. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10810.8s)]
*  Which is the smallest number of episodes ever ordered by a network. Four. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10814.8s)]
*  I mean, six is a slap in the face. Four is like... [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10820.8s)]
*  Don't quit your day job. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10824.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10825.8s)]
*  He lives here in L.A. most of the year, out of necessity, not choice. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10826.8s)]
*  He gave us a tour of his two-bedroom home on one of his rare days off, pining all the while for his native New York. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10830.8s)]
*  So you don't consider this home at all? [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10837.8s)]
*  No. No, it's a giant hotel room. I'm on the road. I've been on the road here for 16 years. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10839.8s)]
*  The house itself gives away nothing. He calls it a waste of money. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10846.8s)]
*  Furnished by a decorator, it speaks to the owner's lack of interest or lack of time. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10850.8s)]
*  The couches look like they've never been dented. It's more antiseptic than homey. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10855.8s)]
*  Do you clean this yourself or do you have a crew from the hospital come in every day and scrub it down? [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10859.8s)]
*  I clean it. I spend half the day cleaning it. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10864.8s)]
*  Really? [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10866.8s)]
*  Yeah, and the other half doing the show. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10867.8s)]
*  You can make microchips in here. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10869.8s)]
*  Hey, it's Jerry. Hey. [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10871.8s)]
*  Hey, Jerry. How you doing? [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10873.8s)]
*  Seinfeld seems most at home here in his back-lawed office working with his show's writers, an elite mix of young television veterans who have worked at places like Letterman, Conan O'Brien and Saturday Night Live. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10875.8s)]
*  Do you feel pressure to put out a good product? I mean, this is probably the best-written show on television. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10887.8s)]
*  Probably. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10893.8s)]
*  Probably? [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10895.8s)]
*  Probably. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10896.8s)]
*  They look as if they could be characters on their own show. Seinfeld says his writers are the next generation of TV executives, and many have already left to develop or run shows of their own. [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10898.8s)]
*  Is there a tone? [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10909.8s)]
*  Bad things happening to selfish people. It's the easiest way to describe it. [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10911.8s)]
*  You know, they always preach this thing of likeability on TV. You've got to be likable. There's nothing likable about these characters. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10915.8s)]
*  No, they're shallow. They're shallow. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10923.8s)]
*  Self-indulgent. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10925.8s)]
*  Greedy. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10927.8s)]
*  Greedy. Mean. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10928.8s)]
*  Mean. Treacherous. They will plot and plan against each other, close friends for some short-term gain. They're despicable. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10929.8s)]
*  Why do people like them? [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10939.8s)]
*  They're funny. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10941.8s)]
*  The show's mean streak comes in large part from this man. It's co-creator Larry David, the neurotic model for the George Costanza character. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10944.8s)]
*  He began to whine about his bald spot and our camera angle even before the interview began. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10953.8s)]
*  The high overhead thing. I don't like it. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10958.8s)]
*  Until this last season, he was Jerry Seinfeld's partner and collaborator. Then burned out and anxious to try something new, he quit, leaving Seinfeld on his own. [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10961.8s)]
*  Larry David has his own theory on why the audience loves some of the unprincipled characters he helped create. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10970.8s)]
*  It's the actors, because they're great actors and they can pull it off. This material in the hands of other actors, the show would be a disaster. [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10976.8s)]
*  That material has included hilarious half hours on unspeakable subjects that have worked because they've never been mentioned by name. [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10984.8s)]
*  What's the matter? [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10993.8s)]
*  My mother caught me. [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10995.8s)]
*  Caught? You're doing what? [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=10998.8s)]
*  You know, I was alone. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11000.8s)]
*  You've done episodes on masturbation and oral sex and you've been able to disguise all of it as family entertainment. [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11007.8s)]
*  What a scam! [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11017.8s)]
*  How do you do it? [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11021.8s)]
*  How do we do it? We're very good with language. I think it's funny to be delicate with something that is explosive. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11022.8s)]
*  The challenge of handling, kind of like driving the nitro truck of material down a dirt road became the game for us. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11031.8s)]
*  Do you guys live together? [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11043.8s)]
*  I knew you looked familiar! [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11045.8s)]
*  Take the outing, an episode on homosexuality. Because Jerry is thin, single and neat, a reporter assumes that he and George are more than just good friends. [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11046.8s)]
*  No, everyone's going to think we're gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that! [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11056.8s)]
*  And I said, that's the line. That's going to enable us to do this show. Not that there's anything wrong with it. [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11060.8s)]
*  If we say that every time, it'll be, we'll be able to say something about political correctness and cover ourselves on the other side too. [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11066.8s)]
*  So some of it is like figuring out the right way to take on some of these. [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11075.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's fun. That's part of the game. It's like playing by the rules. That's what makes the game fun, is the rules. Without the rules, it's not fun. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11079.8s)]
*  One of the rules that Seinfeld breaks is the one that says the star gets all the good lines. [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11088.8s)]
*  And the Seinfeld cast, Michael Richards, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Jason Alexander, have been the beneficiaries of Seinfeld's generosity. [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11092.8s)]
*  I think one of the most amazing things he did from the beginning of the show is, unlike a lot of comics who come into a series, he was not hell bent on making it a vehicle for himself. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11100.8s)]
*  You can see some people think. I don't see him think. I see him, it's almost like there's a machine going on back there. You can kind of tell when it's working, but it doesn't reveal anything about himself. [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11112.8s)]
*  He's a very smart guy because he's private and he keeps his privacy and it's separate. It's mature. And I think that's why he's a stable person. So my guess is you're not going to get to see the really private part of him. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11122.8s)]
*  What we saw of Jerry's private life in February was very public. A long time relationship with Shoshana Lundstein, a UCLA student half his age. They've been tabloid fodder for the last four years. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11140.8s)]
*  There's just a nice relationship going on. We're happy. We have a good time. I think maybe it's because I'm so immature and she's so mature that we meet in the middle. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11151.8s)]
*  You think you're immature? Oh yeah. In what ways? [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11164.8s)]
*  Name one. [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11167.8s)]
*  Name one. [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11170.8s)]
*  Sexually? [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11172.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11173.8s)]
*  Why? [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11174.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11175.8s)]
*  What do you mean? [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11177.8s)]
*  I'm embarrassed. I am not going to talk about being sexually immature on 60 Minutes. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11178.8s)]
*  But you think you are. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11184.8s)]
*  It's not 60 swinging minutes. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11185.8s)]
*  Right. Right. But you said name one and I named one. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11187.8s)]
*  Okay. Well, I'm 42 years old. I'm not married. That's not real mature. That's nothing to be proud of. I should have settled down by now. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11191.8s)]
*  Are you going to get married? [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11205.8s)]
*  Yes. [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11206.8s)]
*  To Shoshana? [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11207.8s)]
*  I hope. I don't know. [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11211.8s)]
*  Have you asked her? [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11214.8s)]
*  No. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11216.8s)]
*  Are you going to ask her today? [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11218.8s)]
*  I mean, I'll get married. You know when I'll get married? I'll get married when somebody like John F. Kennedy Jr. gets married. [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11219.8s)]
*  He got married. [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11223.8s)]
*  Really? [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11225.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11226.8s)]
*  Are you married? [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11227.8s)]
*  No. [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11228.8s)]
*  You're used to talking to too many liars. [[03:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11232.8s)]
*  Can we get some powder on my face? I'm sweating. Come in. Come in. Go ahead. [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11234.8s)]
*  Do you think... [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11245.8s)]
*  God. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11247.8s)]
*  Do the tabloids drive you crazy? [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11248.8s)]
*  No. I love it. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11250.8s)]
*  You do like it? [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11251.8s)]
*  Yeah. They're fine. [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11252.8s)]
*  How does Shoshana feel about it? [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11253.8s)]
*  It was hard at first. But we got used to it. [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11254.8s)]
*  Can you use this? [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11258.8s)]
*  Sure. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11259.8s)]
*  The tabloids are fine. They make up stuff. You know. And that's fine too. People that read tabloids I think deserve to be lied to. [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11260.8s)]
*  What's the happiest you've ever been? [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11271.8s)]
*  I guess now. I guess I would have to say now. I never thought I could do what I'm doing now. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11273.8s)]
*  And I'm very proud of the fact that I believed in myself. And that I turned out to have something. Because I didn't really know. [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11285.8s)]
*  And so the fact that I bet on myself and didn't lose is a pretty deep reward. [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11297.8s)]
*  There was a question about whether or not the show would be back for a ninth season. But NBC reached for its checkbook and re-signed the cast to record contracts. [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11306.8s)]
*  Each of Seinfeld's co-stars will reportedly collect 13 million dollars for their ninth season. [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11315.8s)]
*  Jerry and his cast will be together for another year. But Jerry and Shoshana won't be. That contract Seinfeld was unable to negotiate. And they've called it quits. [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11321.8s)]
*  Did you ever hear the one about the New Yorker who, even in the best of times, was famous for focusing on life's little annoyances? [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11331.8s)]
*  A global pandemic hit, and here's the punchline. He turned into a pillar of optimism. So it goes for that titan of comedy, Jerry Seinfeld. [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11350.8s)]
*  Now 66, Seinfeld has halted his sold-out stand-up tour due to COVID. His latest successful show, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, is also on hiatus. [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11360.8s)]
*  Like many of us, he's been sheltering at home with family. But that hasn't stopped him from doing what he's always done. Helping himself to life's absurdities and meticulously spinning them into comedic gold. [[03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11370.8s)]
*  The observational comic, almost by definition, sees the world differently. We spent a day in September with Seinfeld and found out how he sees things in the year 2020. [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11382.8s)]
*  Hey, John. Nice to see you. [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11395.8s)]
*  Greeting Jerry Seinfeld can be uncomfortable under normal circumstances. [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11397.8s)]
*  I don't know. That doesn't do anything. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11401.8s)]
*  Then you factor in COVID. [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11404.8s)]
*  No more handshakes, no more hugs. [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11406.8s)]
*  You're not into the elbows. [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11409.8s)]
*  Nah. It's a poor substitute. [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11411.8s)]
*  Are you seeing comedy in this mess? [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11414.8s)]
*  I did write some things down. Oh, the thing about, um, that the first thing they told us, remember, they don't say it anymore, but they said don't touch your face. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11416.8s)]
*  Okay, so we're going to stop the whole world and you can't, you can't do this. But don't do this. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11424.8s)]
*  How do you not do this when they tell you we're shutting down the world, but don't go, oh my God, oh my God. [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11432.8s)]
*  When we asked Seinfeld where he'd like to spend the day, he said Queens, halfway between his hometown of Massapequa, Long Island and his current address in Manhattan. [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11439.8s)]
*  This park was the site of the 1964 World's Fair, which Seinfeld visited as a boy. [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11449.8s)]
*  You know, the World's Fair was always about, we're going to perfect the world. It's going to be easy and we're going to do it. And here's what we're going to do. [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11455.8s)]
*  And it's going to be great. And when you're 10 years old, you believe that. [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11463.8s)]
*  And I don't think that completely foolish optimism has ever left me. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11467.8s)]
*  We found Jerry Seinfeld downright upbeat to be out of the house and in front of a camera for the first time since COVID. [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11473.8s)]
*  Are we okay with this? Even with the aggravation of planes flying overhead. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11480.8s)]
*  Now we're in showbiz. Now we're back. See, we thought they were going to call off the... [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11485.8s)]
*  This is really being back. Call for plane. [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11491.8s)]
*  Show business has been his business for five decades. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11495.8s)]
*  When 60 Minutes checked in with Seinfeld in the 90s, he was in the thick of his wildly successful sitcom. [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11500.8s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Jerry Seinfeld. [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11506.8s)]
*  The series grew out of Seinfeld's observational, stylish standup. [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11509.8s)]
*  Waterproof watch. That's important. Completely out of oxygen. And look at the time. [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11513.8s)]
*  Now I'm dead and I'm late. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11519.8s)]
*  He first toned his craft on Manhattan's Comedy Club circuit. [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11521.8s)]
*  What was it like coming into the city to perform? [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11525.8s)]
*  It was like when the doors open on the Emerald City and the Wizard of Oz. [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11529.8s)]
*  And I would gulp so hard, oh my God, I'm going into the grown-ups place. [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11534.8s)]
*  And not just going in there. I'm going to go on stage there. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11541.8s)]
*  Did it live up to your expectations? [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11547.8s)]
*  Sure. Still does. I am so madly in love with New York City. [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11549.8s)]
*  I didn't know how to be. And in New York, they say, this is how you do. This is what you do. [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11555.8s)]
*  Here's how to be. Be cranky and be loud and be funny and complain and suffer and make fun of everything and everybody. [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11563.8s)]
*  That's how you be. [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11574.8s)]
*  This city he romanticizes, Seinfeld remembered seeing a miniature replica of New York at the World's Fair as a kid. [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11576.8s)]
*  The model is still on permanent exhibit at the Queens Museum. [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11584.8s)]
*  And since we were right there, he wanted to take another look. [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11588.8s)]
*  We were allowed past the perimeter through a hidden entrance for a VIP perspective. [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11592.8s)]
*  I guess this is the way God looks at things. My first apartment would be right there. [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11597.8s)]
*  His civic pride is such that when a local comedy club owner posted an essay on LinkedIn this past summer, [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11605.8s)]
*  claiming New York City would never bounce back from COVID, Seinfeld was moved to write a rebuttal. [[03:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11611.8s)]
*  Is New York dead? [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11617.8s)]
*  Are you asking me? [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11619.8s)]
*  I'm asking you. [[03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11620.8s)]
*  When you were a kid, remember kicking over the anthill? That's what just happened to us. [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11621.8s)]
*  They just kicked over the whole anthill. And what do the ants do? All right, hand me the next crumb. Let's get back to work. [[03:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11626.8s)]
*  And by the way, I have nothing against that guy. He's fine. [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11634.8s)]
*  I didn't like that nobody was rebutting it. And I realized, oh, I guess that's my job. Somebody, a real New Yorker has to answer this. [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11637.8s)]
*  You called him some putz on LinkedIn. [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11647.8s)]
*  I don't even know what LinkedIn is. That's who that guy is for the rest of his life. Oh, look who's here. The putz from LinkedIn. [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11649.8s)]
*  But you felt the need to defend your turf? [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11657.8s)]
*  I just don't want New Yorkism to die. I don't want it to be replaced by deep concern and over sentimentality. [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11661.8s)]
*  You can have those things, but be a little badass, too. We don't care that things are tough. Everything's always tough. It's tough to live here. [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11676.8s)]
*  Got a little blowback for that. He's out in the Hamptons writing about New York. [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11687.8s)]
*  Oh, shut up. Sorry. Sorry. I did better than you. My apologies. [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11691.8s)]
*  Got a laugh from the camera guy. [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11701.8s)]
*  Getting a laugh was the ultimate currency for Seinfeld, growing up as he did in a middle class Jewish household. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11704.8s)]
*  Were your folks funny? [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11710.8s)]
*  Yes, my dad particularly. Wildly funny. [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11712.8s)]
*  Like if there'd be a fly, it would land on your soup and somebody would go, ooh. And he'd go, how much could he eat? [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11716.8s)]
*  What was their parenting style? [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11725.8s)]
*  Complete neglect. Absolute total neglect. It worked for me. It made me very independent. They were both orphans, so they had a natural independence. [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11728.8s)]
*  Both your parents were orphans? [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11740.8s)]
*  Yes. [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11742.8s)]
*  What impact do you think that had on your family growing up? [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11743.8s)]
*  It was fantastic. Complete self-reliance. That was expected. [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11746.8s)]
*  Now, you know, you end up having to raise yourself in a lot of ways. I don't know how to hold a fork or I can't make a sandwich. [[03:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11751.8s)]
*  You know, 18 years, not a hint of what to do. [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11759.8s)]
*  For someone who couldn't make a sandwich, he's done all right. [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11763.8s)]
*  I could see directly into the eye of the great fish. [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11766.8s)]
*  Whatever. [[03:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11769.8s)]
*  Seinfeld the series has made more money in syndication than any other comedy. [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11770.8s)]
*  Who's driving? [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11774.8s)]
*  You are. I can't get that thing in my car. [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11775.8s)]
*  My parents, they did not know where my school was. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11778.8s)]
*  In 2017, Seinfeld signed an estimated $100 million deal with Netflix to run two comedy specials and a series no streaming service wanted at first. [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11781.8s)]
*  Why does comedians and cars getting coffee work? [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11792.8s)]
*  I think it works because comedians don't like to chit chat. [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11794.8s)]
*  We like to really talk about something. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11798.8s)]
*  People say disgusting things to me because they think I'll like it. [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11801.8s)]
*  And I wanted to show this other part of my world of hanging out with these people and how fun it is. [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11805.8s)]
*  His latest project, the guy who famously did a show about nothing, has a new book titled Is This Anything? [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11812.8s)]
*  Seinfeld explained that's what comedians ask each other when they're working on new material. [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11819.8s)]
*  Published by Simon and Schuster, part of Viacom's CBS, the book is a primer on joke writing. [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11824.8s)]
*  I'm not a autobiography kind of guy, but what I'm interested in is craft and technique and approach to doing an art. [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11830.8s)]
*  And being able to look at how these bits are built, you could kind of learn, oh, I see why that word is here. [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11841.8s)]
*  Are there words that are objectively funny? [[03:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11850.8s)]
*  Oh, LinkedIn. [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11852.8s)]
*  But I mean, LinkedIn, if I was to break it down, it's the K's and the N's and the L's and it's new. [[03:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11854.8s)]
*  And I mean, if you want me to go further, I will. [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11863.8s)]
*  You're taking a Yiddish word from the 18th century and you're putting it with LinkedIn. [[03:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11866.8s)]
*  That's what a laugh is. It's a chemical explosion. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11872.8s)]
*  Little schedule, little internet. [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11875.8s)]
*  The Yiddish language is the greatest goldmine of comedy ever. [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11878.8s)]
*  Every word is funny. [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11884.8s)]
*  Putz notwithstanding, Seinfeld has always kept his act clean. [[03:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11886.8s)]
*  The buffet is like taking your dog to Petco and letting your dog do the shopping. [[03:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11890.8s)]
*  At a time when many comedians have had to apologize for causing offense, he considers it part of his job description to accommodate changing standards. [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11895.8s)]
*  What do you say to some of your colleagues who say, like, everyone's so sensitive, you can't joke about anything anymore? [[03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11903.8s)]
*  They're always moving the gates and you got to make the gates. [[03:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11909.8s)]
*  And it is always difficult, changing, sometimes unfair, sometimes not right. [[03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11913.8s)]
*  You know, Lenny Bruce dealt with what he had to deal with and we have to deal with what you have to deal with. [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11919.8s)]
*  It was time for a break in our interview and Seinfeld focused his powers of observation on us. [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11924.8s)]
*  Well, we got to do the walk and talk. You have to see people walking on 60 Minutes. [[03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11930.8s)]
*  We want to know how that, how to, can this person walk? Let's see it. [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11935.8s)]
*  I don't know why you never do a thing on 60 Minutes without watching them walk. Look at that. They're walking. [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11939.8s)]
*  And sure enough, it's so beautiful. [[03:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11945.8s)]
*  Seinfeld has spent the last two decades growing into another role. [[03:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11949.8s)]
*  Hello. Hello. You look so perfect. Thank you. [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11953.8s)]
*  Family man. Very nervous. [[03:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11957.8s)]
*  He and his wife, Jessica, have three teenage children and lead a largely private life. [[03:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11960.8s)]
*  Are you wearing your white socks on TV? [[03:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11966.8s)]
*  She is more complimentary of his co-parenting skills. [[03:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11970.8s)]
*  Stand-up seems like such an individual sport. How is he as a teammate? [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11974.8s)]
*  I will tell you that it was a slow build. It wasn't natural. [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11978.8s)]
*  And when we first had children, he had absolutely no idea what to do. [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11984.8s)]
*  The look on their face was, is anyone helping you? [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11992.8s)]
*  Because I didn't seem to be connected to anything that was going on. [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=11996.8s)]
*  But you say he's hit a stride now that he's parenting teenagers. [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12000.8s)]
*  He wasn't one of those dads who wore a front carrier. He grew up in the 50s. [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12004.8s)]
*  But now he is much better at this age than I am at this age. [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12011.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. I never looked at it that way. We've kind of... [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12017.8s)]
*  Switched roles. Yeah, a little bit. [[03:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12020.8s)]
*  Jessica runs Good Plus, a foundation she started almost 20 years ago as a used stroller and baby goods drive. [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12023.8s)]
*  Good Plus now helps 50,000 low-income families with a focus on engaging dads. [[03:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12030.8s)]
*  And she does it despite some household distractions. [[03:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12036.8s)]
*  I think maybe that he misses being on stage. [[03:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12039.8s)]
*  And when he and his friends are on the phone, they just yell. [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12042.8s)]
*  And it is something to live with. [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12046.8s)]
*  You know, a lot of times when you could say the same thing louder, it's funnier when you say it louder. [[03:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12050.8s)]
*  Why would you do that? It's stupid. Right? [[03:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12056.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's that. [[03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12060.8s)]
*  With the home of his other great love just a few hundred yards away, [[03:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12062.8s)]
*  we asked Seinfeld if he had considered putting in a bid this year when the New York Mets were up for sale. [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12065.8s)]
*  I don't have the money. [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12071.8s)]
*  Would you if you did? [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12073.8s)]
*  No. Absolutely not. Why? Why? [[03:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12074.8s)]
*  So I could have more people yelling at me on the street when they lose? [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12078.8s)]
*  The ultimate peak experience of a baseball game is a seat, a hot dog and a beer. [[03:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12082.8s)]
*  There's nothing better above that. [[03:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12089.8s)]
*  He'll have to wait to sit in the stands with a hot dog, [[03:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12091.8s)]
*  just as his fans will have to wait until the pandemic is over to watch Jerry Seinfeld perform in person. [[03:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12094.8s)]
*  This will be funny. [[03:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12101.8s)]
*  Comedians will figure out what we can say and can't say when we get back in front of audiences. [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12103.8s)]
*  How's this going to work? [[03:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12110.8s)]
*  I don't think it's going to work for a while. [[03:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12112.8s)]
*  I don't like compromised versions of things. [[03:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12114.8s)]
*  I want the real thing, the authentic thing. I want the pure hit. [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12117.8s)]
*  I want the real drug. I want real New York pizza. [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12120.8s)]
*  So I'll wait. [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12124.8s)]
*  It's no secret big Hollywood studios like a sure bet, [[03:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12131.8s)]
*  and there's no shortage of predictable movies to prove it, [[03:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12138.8s)]
*  which is probably why Nicolas Cage left Los Angeles for Las Vegas a long time ago. [[03:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12142.8s)]
*  At 59, the Academy Award winner owns one of the most eclectic lists of film credits in the business. [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12148.8s)]
*  He's been at it for more than 40 years, [[03:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12154.8s)]
*  pivoting from leading man to action hero to a slew of lesser features and back again. [[03:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12157.8s)]
*  As we first told you in April, behind that kaleidoscope of characters is a unique imagination [[03:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12163.8s)]
*  and an encyclopedic knowledge of film that seems to motivate everything Nicolas Cage does, [[03:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12170.8s)]
*  his work, his life, and even this. [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12176.8s)]
*  I always loved that character. [[03:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12180.8s)]
*  We're going to see Nicolas Cage's brand new gold Lamborghini, [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12183.8s)]
*  a tribute to a beloved 1968 film directed by Federico Fellini featuring this gilded Ferrari. [[03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12187.8s)]
*  It was a crazy, beautiful Fellini movie, and it inspired me. [[03:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12195.8s)]
*  So when I saw this, I said, that's the car. It's not a Ferrari, [[03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12199.8s)]
*  which would be great, but they don't really have any gold Ferraris. [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12203.8s)]
*  Have you driven this out here beyond the gates? [[03:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12206.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12209.8s)]
*  It's fun. Snap, crackle, pop. [[03:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12211.8s)]
*  By any measure, Nicolas Cage is not slowing down. [[03:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12221.8s)]
*  He's revamped the role of Dracula in a movie called Renfield [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12225.8s)]
*  and has another five movies coming up. [[03:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12230.8s)]
*  We met Nicolas Cage at the home he shares with his wife and young daughter in Las Vegas. [[03:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12234.8s)]
*  It is exactly what you might imagine Nicolas Cage's home in Las Vegas would be. [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12240.8s)]
*  Part goth cathedral, part avant-garde gallery. [[03:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12246.8s)]
*  Okay, Hogan! [[03:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12249.8s)]
*  There's an African crow in the living room, a cat that could scare off a burglar, and this. [[03:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12251.8s)]
*  This is my black dragon that's a monitor lizard. He'll get to be about six feet long. [[03:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12256.8s)]
*  He's like having a real dinosaur in your house. It's kind of amazing. And he's alive. [[03:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12262.8s)]
*  That kind of imagination is in his DNA. [[03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12267.8s)]
*  Nicolas Kim Coppola was born on the fringe of cinema royalty. [[03:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12270.8s)]
*  His uncle is director Francis Ford Coppola. [[03:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12274.8s)]
*  He told us his mother Joy, a choreographer, suffered from severe mental illness [[03:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12277.8s)]
*  and was institutionalized for much of his childhood. [[03:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12282.8s)]
*  He and his two brothers were raised by his father August, a literature professor, [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12286.8s)]
*  who introduced him to the masterworks of Italian and German filmmakers, [[03:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12291.8s)]
*  igniting his love of cinema. [[03:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12295.8s)]
*  As a teenager, he worked at a movie theater and says he was mesmerized by the big screen. [[03:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12297.8s)]
*  Was it about being a movie star or was it about escaping into something else? [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12303.8s)]
*  It was about wanting to be James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause and wearing that red jacket, [[03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12308.8s)]
*  wanting to be John in Saturday Night Fever. I came out of the cinema electrified. [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12314.8s)]
*  I was like, yeah, wanting to go there. [[03:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12319.8s)]
*  And after seeing James Dean in East of Eden, he did. [[03:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12322.8s)]
*  It was more meaningful to me than anything else I'd experienced. [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12326.8s)]
*  Music, you know, Beethoven, Beatles, painting. [[03:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12331.8s)]
*  What I saw in that moment made me realize the power, [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12335.8s)]
*  the excitement of what you can convey through film performance, film performance. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12341.8s)]
*  He's been in pursuit of that feeling for most of his life, [[03:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12348.8s)]
*  inhabiting characters of every stripe, a baby snatching ex-con, [[03:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12351.8s)]
*  I'll be taking these huggies and whatever cash you got to the bed, [[03:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12356.8s)]
*  a Brooklyn baker, an alcoholic screenwriter, [[03:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12361.8s)]
*  you have a cell phone I could borrow, a treasure hunter, and even himself. [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12365.8s)]
*  Nick Cage. [[03:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12369.8s)]
*  Cage's first feature role came in 1982's Fast Times at Ridgemont High. [[03:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12370.8s)]
*  The 17-year-old blends into the background, but his Coppola name did not. [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12375.8s)]
*  His uncle directed The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12380.8s)]
*  Sick of being hazed about it on set, he changed his name, [[03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12384.8s)]
*  inspired by a Marvel superhero with unbreakable skin. [[03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12388.8s)]
*  When people think of Nicolas Cage, I wanted it to have like a punk rock energy at that time. [[03:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12392.8s)]
*  I wanted it to be unpredictable. You don't know what you're going to get. [[03:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12399.8s)]
*  I wanted it to be exciting and a little scary. [[03:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12403.8s)]
*  It has been. After more than 100 movies, Nicolas Cage is almost his own genre. [[03:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12406.8s)]
*  He told us when he read the script for Peggy Sue God Married, [[03:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12413.8s)]
*  he worried it was going to be too much like the play Our Town. [[03:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12416.8s)]
*  How did you know about that? [[03:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12420.8s)]
*  Which he hated. [[03:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12421.8s)]
*  I grew up watching Gumby and listening to Pielky, [[03:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12423.8s)]
*  and I thought, well that would be a good voice for a character, especially in this movie. [[03:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12426.8s)]
*  Thank you for saving me. [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12430.8s)]
*  And so I thought if I do that, that won't be boring. [[03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12432.8s)]
*  That'll be like, what the hell is he doing? [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12435.8s)]
*  Things just work out better in the end. [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12437.8s)]
*  And Kathleen Turner said, like, what the hell is he doing? [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12439.8s)]
*  I think I frustrated her with the performance, but I adored her. [[03:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12443.8s)]
*  Did she ever say, like, knock it off? [[03:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12446.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[03:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12448.8s)]
*  But Cage would draw from odd places again in The Coen Brothers, Raising Arizona. [[03:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12449.8s)]
*  How did you envision that role? [[03:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12456.8s)]
*  H.I. McDonough was like that thrush muffler symbol, the Woody Woodpecker with the cigar. [[03:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12459.8s)]
*  I saw him with, like, the red hair sticking up, like a Looney Tunes character come to life again. [[03:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12465.8s)]
*  I'm going to ask you about one scene in that movie. [[03:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12473.8s)]
*  You're having a mug shot taken and you turn, and as you're walking away, you slap your ass. [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12475.8s)]
*  Let me know how this came out. [[03:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12481.8s)]
*  I had it all thought out. [[03:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12483.8s)]
*  Giddy up, you know, like getting himself up out of the mug shot. [[03:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12485.8s)]
*  Cage's catalog of inspiration extends from cartoons to the haunting German films he watched as a child. [[03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12489.8s)]
*  You've been influenced by German expressionists. What does that look like? [[03:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12497.8s)]
*  Well, what it is is specifically movies like Cabin of Dr. Caligari or Nosferatu or Metropolis. [[03:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12500.8s)]
*  The mad scientist shows the robot hand and it goes like that. [[03:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12509.8s)]
*  You know, it's just like a large expressionistic acting. [[03:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12514.8s)]
*  So I put that into Moonstruck. I lost my hand. That's exactly a direct steal. [[03:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12517.8s)]
*  I lost my hand! I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand! Johnny has his bride! [[03:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12523.8s)]
*  You want me to take my heartbreak, put it away and forget? [[03:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12529.8s)]
*  Come on. [[03:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12535.8s)]
*  Thirty-five years on, Ronnie Camerieri, the operatic one-handed baker in the romantic comedy Moonstruck, remains one of his most memorable roles. [[03:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12536.8s)]
*  You can do this one thing for me. [[03:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12547.8s)]
*  But Cage says it was a small movie called Leaving Las Vegas that was the answer to his prayers. [[03:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12549.8s)]
*  What did you think when you first read that script? [[03:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12556.8s)]
*  That was the feeling that I had with East of Eden and James Deem. [[03:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12558.8s)]
*  This is the kind of movie I really want to make. [[03:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12564.8s)]
*  A heartbreaking drama about two wounded people who somehow have this true love. [[03:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12569.8s)]
*  How did you figure out how to play that role? [[03:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12578.8s)]
*  Well, I looked at a lot of great movies. I looked at Chris Christopperson in A Star Is Born. [[03:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12580.8s)]
*  From him, I got that feeling of he was always smiling. [[03:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12585.8s)]
*  In my view, the only thing sadder than a person who's in a sad situation and knows it is a person who's in a sad situation and doesn't know it. [[03:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12589.8s)]
*  You're like some kind of antidote that mixes with the liquor and keeps me in balance. [[03:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12597.8s)]
*  But that won't last forever. [[03:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12603.8s)]
*  I was saying to myself, literally, I'm never going to win the Academy Award, so let's just do this anyway because nobody wanted to make it. [[03:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12605.8s)]
*  At the Oscars, you announced on stage you loved the idea of blurring the line between art and commerce by making this small film. [[03:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12613.8s)]
*  And then you start doing these big action films. [[03:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12620.8s)]
*  Yeah. That was about staying unpredictable and trying something new again. [[03:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12622.8s)]
*  But at the time when I did it, I think it pissed a lot of people off. [[03:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12630.8s)]
*  It was like, well, you're an actor's actor. You're not supposed to be doing adventure films. [[03:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12634.8s)]
*  You will not. [[03:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12638.8s)]
*  But he did. [[03:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12640.8s)]
*  The Rock with Sean Connery, a Prison Break movie con air, put the money back in the box, the National Treasure franchise and face up where Cage's character literally swaps faces with John Travolta. [[03:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12641.8s)]
*  You've got something in common. [[03:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12657.8s)]
*  An absurd idea that delivered big box office returns and helped catapult Cage into the category of Hollywood's highest paid actors. [[03:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12658.8s)]
*  Where's your head at when that starts happening? [[03:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12667.8s)]
*  Oh, great. Now I can make another Leaving Las Vegas. Let's keep doing it. Let's keep mixing it up. Let's keep challenging ourselves. [[03:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12670.8s)]
*  But Cage ended up facing a different kind of challenge. [[03:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12677.8s)]
*  We wanted to ask him about reports that he blew through his fortune buying exotic cars, mansions around the globe, even a dinosaur skull. [[03:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12681.8s)]
*  But his African crow, Hugen, objected to the line of questioning. [[03:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12689.8s)]
*  Hi, Hugen. [[03:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12694.8s)]
*  Right on cue. [[03:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12695.8s)]
*  It's nice to hear you're talking again. I know everybody in the house kind of freak you out. [[03:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12696.8s)]
*  The houses, right? Castles in Germany, in England, an island, a mansion in New Orleans. [[03:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12701.8s)]
*  Right. [[03:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12707.8s)]
*  What's that about? [[03:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12708.8s)]
*  I was overinvested in real estate. It wasn't because I spent $80 on an octopus. The real estate market crashed and I couldn't get out in time. [[03:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12709.8s)]
*  How much money did you end up owing to the IRS and to your creditors? [[03:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12717.8s)]
*  I paid them all back, but it was about $6 million. I never filed for bankruptcy. [[03:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12720.8s)]
*  He moved to tax-free Las Vegas, dug in and worked nonstop, making three to four movies a year. [[03:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12726.8s)]
*  That had to be a dark period for you. [[03:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12733.8s)]
*  It was dark. Sure. [[03:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12736.8s)]
*  Did the work help you get through? [[03:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12738.8s)]
*  No doubt. Work. Work was always my guardian angel. [[03:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12740.8s)]
*  It may not have been blue chip, but it would still work. [[03:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12745.8s)]
*  When somebody suggests during that period of time, when they say, these critics say, like, oh, he's just here for a paycheck and he's phoning it in. [[03:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12750.8s)]
*  Even if the movie ultimately is crummy, they know I'm not phoning it in, that I care every time. [[03:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12758.8s)]
*  But there are those folks that are probably thinking that the only good acting that I can do is the acting that I chose to do by design, [[03:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12765.8s)]
*  which was more operatic and larger than life and so-called cage rage and all that. But you're not going to get that every time. [[03:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12774.8s)]
*  But part of the appeal is the cage rage, a moniker his fans have for his outsides, some say, over-the-top moments on film. [[03:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12784.8s)]
*  I'm trying to help you and you won't listen! [[03:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12793.8s)]
*  You go for it. I've heard you've described it as like going for the triple axel every time. And sometimes you land it and sometimes you don't. [[03:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12795.8s)]
*  Well, not every time. But there are things that I do want to go for, sometimes that I have a vision for, and I do. [[03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12802.8s)]
*  Like his 2021 performance as a heartbroken chef in the movie Pig. [[03:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12810.8s)]
*  None of it is real. The critics aren't real. The customers aren't real. Because this isn't real. [[03:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12816.8s)]
*  When I played Rob in Pig, I thought I entered the room. I felt that I was closer to me than maybe I have ever been before in film performance. [[03:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12828.8s)]
*  She died. [[03:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12845.8s)]
*  What do you mean closer to you? [[03:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12848.8s)]
*  That I wasn't acting. I felt that I was doing exactly what I care about. I think it's probably my best movie. And I think I'll put that up against Leaving Las Vegas or anything else. [[03:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12850.8s)]
*  That would include his turn as Dracula in his latest movie Renfield. Cage met us at a favorite hangout on the Strip to talk about the Count. [[03:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12863.8s)]
*  We have much to discuss. [[03:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12873.8s)]
*  Dracula is daunting. [[03:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12875.8s)]
*  I am Count Dracula. [[03:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12877.8s)]
*  Because it's a legacy. [[03:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12879.8s)]
*  He's my servant. [[03:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12880.8s)]
*  Dracula is a character that has been done well many times. He's also a character that has been done poorly many times. [[03:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12882.8s)]
*  But for me, I think Christopher Lee, he was my Dracula. He made Dracula scary. We had a happy marriage in terms of I could bring war. I wanted to go into the camera with the teeth almost like the shark in Jaws. [[03:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12892.8s)]
*  You seem like a guy who's all in all the time. You don't do anything halfway. [[03:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12908.8s)]
*  Very insightful, Sharon. Very, very insightful. [[03:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12915.8s)]
*  Let's eat. [[03:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEawadotB0&t=12920.8s)]
