# Secretary of Commerce; On British Soil; St. Mary's | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q)
*  This is just good business. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is a fast-rising star in the Democratic Party, enforcing large [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  parts of our tough China trade policy while working to create millions of new jobs here [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=14.84s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=21.84s)]
*  We allowed manufacturing in this country to wither on the vine in search of cheaper labor [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=23.2s)]
*  in Asia, cheaper capital in Asia, and here we are. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=29.98s)]
*  It's pretty well hidden, isn't it? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=34.9s)]
*  Yeah, well, if you didn't know how to get here, you wouldn't easily stumble across [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=38.58s)]
*  it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=45.34s)]
*  On the windswept island of Alderney, the Nazis operated concentration camps on British soil. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  Decades later, the British government is investigating how many people were killed here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=55.06s)]
*  Why might the British government have tried to cover up what happened on the Channel Islands? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=61.42s)]
*  So are you math geniuses? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=70.3s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=73.34s)]
*  How did these high school students prove an ancient mathematical equation that was thought [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=74.34s)]
*  to be impossible for 2,000 years? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=78.9s)]
*  We start with just a regular right triangle where the angle in the corner is 90 degrees. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=82.02s)]
*  Then we start creating similar but smaller right triangles and then it continues for [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=87.46s)]
*  infinity. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=92.97999999999999s)]
*  Am I going a little too... [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=93.97999999999999s)]
*  You've been beyond me since the beginning. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=94.97999999999999s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=100.82s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=103.58s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=104.84s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=106.22s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=107.42s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=108.78s)]
*  We'll be back with more stories tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=110.3s)]
*  What does the Secretary of Commerce do? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=120.58s)]
*  Until now, mainly promote U.S. businesses abroad. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=123.74s)]
*  It had not been a high-profile job till Gina Raimondo turned the second-tier agency into [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=127.58s)]
*  a center of job creation, manufacturing, and national security. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=133.78s)]
*  Once the governor of Rhode Island, Raimondo at 53 seems to have come out of nowhere to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=139.74s)]
*  become a rising star of the Democratic Party and of the Biden administration. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=146.18s)]
*  As Commerce Secretary, she's running new projects that, as we first reported in April, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=152.24s)]
*  could touch the lives of every American. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  And she's helping lead the expanding Cold War with China and confront Russia's aggression [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=161.62s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=167.26000000000002s)]
*  The battlefield for both those conflicts is technology. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=169.18s)]
*  If you think about national security today, in 2024, it's not just tanks and missiles. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=174.54000000000002s)]
*  It's technology. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  It's semiconductors. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  It's A.I. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  It's drones. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  And the Commerce Department is at the Red Hot Center of technology. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=186.74s)]
*  And at the Red Hot Center, a global chip war that ramped up, says Gina Raimondo, when [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=192.10000000000002s)]
*  Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=198.62s)]
*  The Commerce Department stopped all semiconductor chips from being sold to Russia. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  Every drone, every missile, every tank has semiconductors in them. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  And you know, Leslie, you know we're being effective because shortly after we started [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=210.9s)]
*  that work, we heard stories of the Russians taking semiconductors out of refrigerators, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=216.72s)]
*  out of dishwashers, out of breast pumps. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=224.52s)]
*  Getting the chips to put them into their military equipment. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=228.34s)]
*  However, the Russians are now working their way around this successfully. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=232.78s)]
*  And they're doing better in the war probably because of this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=239.34s)]
*  You are right in what you say. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=242.86s)]
*  But she says. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=244.98000000000002s)]
*  It's absolutely the case that our export controls have hurt their ability to conduct the war, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=246.36s)]
*  And we are enforcing this every minute of every day, doing everything we can. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=254.5s)]
*  These are some of the enforcers. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=260.38s)]
*  I should talk about our controls on Russia. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=261.74s)]
*  Raimondo's team at Commerce that monitors and polices the ban on any company in the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=264.66s)]
*  world from selling products with American chips in them to Russia. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=269.74s)]
*  But not just Russia. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=274.62s)]
*  I've made sure that the most advanced American technologies can't be used in China. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=276.26s)]
*  The Chinese warn that these export controls could trigger an escalating trade war. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=282.74s)]
*  Trade with China accounts for 750,000 U.S. jobs. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=288.90000000000003s)]
*  And if trade ends, we lose our jobs. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=294.06s)]
*  We want to trade with China on the vast majority of goods and services. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=297.02s)]
*  But on those technologies that affect our national security, no. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=304.22s)]
*  Those advanced chips are in consumer goods. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=310.44s)]
*  Banks use them. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=315.16s)]
*  Hospitals. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=316.16s)]
*  This is going toward products that are made for civilian use. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=317.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, they also go into nuclear weapons, surveillance systems. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  And we know they want these chips and our sophisticated technology to advance their [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=328.48s)]
*  military. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=334.72s)]
*  Her toughness has made her a target in China, where fake ads have her promoting the new [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=336.44000000000005s)]
*  Chinese-made smartphone. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=342.32000000000005s)]
*  Last year, the government in Beijing hacked her email. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  And when she was in China, on a trip, ironically, to improve relations, the tech company Huawei [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  introduced that new smartphone with an advanced Chinese-made chip. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=356.12s)]
*  It was kind of in your face, as if to say, look at the chip that we have. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=361.56s)]
*  And it was a pretty good high-level chip. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=367.6s)]
*  Well, I have their attention, clearly. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=370.04s)]
*  And they've gotten yours. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=373.88s)]
*  Well, what tells me is the export controls are working. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=375.16s)]
*  Because that chip is not nearly as good. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=380.16s)]
*  It's years behind what we have in the United States. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=384.28s)]
*  We have the most sophisticated semiconductors in the world. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=388.8s)]
*  China doesn't. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=393.6s)]
*  We've out-innovated China. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=394.6s)]
*  Well, we, you mean Taiwan. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=395.92s)]
*  Fair. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=398.36s)]
*  While American tech companies design the world's most advanced chips, none are actually made [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=399.36s)]
*  in the US. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=406.2s)]
*  Ninety percent of them come from Taiwan. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=407.8s)]
*  And they are key to the future of US military weaponry. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  And China, from time to time, threatens the wolf to invade Taiwan. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=415.4s)]
*  And some people say the whole reason is to get their hands on those chips. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=421.52s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=425.88s)]
*  It's a risk. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=426.88s)]
*  It makes us vulnerable. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=427.88s)]
*  The problem of our outsourcing production goes way beyond high tech, with millions of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=428.88s)]
*  American workers having lost their jobs that went overseas, something Raimondo knows firsthand. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=434.56s)]
*  Starting up as the youngest child in an Italian-American family in Rhode Island. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=442.04s)]
*  This is the old Bulova watch factory, where my dad worked for almost 30 years. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=447.12s)]
*  Her dad lost his job when Bulova abandoned the factory in 1983 and moved its operations [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=451.8s)]
*  to China. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  It's hard for you to imagine it now as you look around here. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=460.52000000000004s)]
*  But this is a bustling place. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  They had a thousand people working here, food trucks on the sidewalk, an electroplating [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  shop there, a tool and die shop there. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=470.76s)]
*  And now this is what you have. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=473.24s)]
*  And how old were you? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=474.88s)]
*  I was in like sixth grade. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=476.26s)]
*  But I saw the toll it took on my dad and my family. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=478.24s)]
*  And that influenced her career choices. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=482.68s)]
*  From when she studied economics and played rugby at Harvard. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=485.88s)]
*  So this is my office. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  To when she left a high paying job as a venture capitalist to run for public office in Rhode [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=491.64s)]
*  Island. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=497.84s)]
*  This was the day that I was sworn in as state treasurer. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=498.84s)]
*  And those are my parents. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=503.64s)]
*  That was my dad. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=504.91999999999996s)]

*  In late 2020, president-elect Joe Biden called her about leading the Commerce Department, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=552.0s)]

*  ranging from monitoring the weather to measuring the level of contaminants in household dust. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=565.52s)]
*  So one day, president-elect Biden calls you and said, what about being Commerce Secretary? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=572.24s)]
*  And you heard that and thought. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=579.64s)]
*  Truthfully, initially I thought, what does the Commerce Secretary do? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=581.8s)]
*  And then the president-elect said to me, come, I want you to work with me to help rebuild [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=587.0s)]
*  American manufacturing. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=592.24s)]

*  One qualification for high office is being able to duck a question like that. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=902.92s)]

*  A minority of them were Jewish. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1082.94s)]
*  Others were from Russia, Ukraine, Poland and Spain. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1085.6200000000001s)]
*  I understand this was called the Tunnel of Death. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1089.54s)]
*  Yes, it was notorious in the memory of prisoners. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1091.98s)]
*  On two occasions they were forced to cram in here in an apparent rehearsal for their own death. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1095.3400000000001s)]
*  After the war, in 1945, the British military investigated the camps and put the death toll [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1103.1s)]
*  on Alderney in the low hundreds. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1109.74s)]
*  Some of those who lost their lives were buried under this plot of land. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1112.78s)]
*  But Marcus Roberts and others argue that more than 10,000 must have died on the island based [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1117.46s)]
*  on controversial calculations about the size of the labour force needed to build the fortifications. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1124.06s)]
*  Roberts told us it's because he's Jewish that he's determined to count all of the dead. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1131.06s)]
*  There's the Jewish instincts to leave no one behind. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1137.06s)]
*  You're trying to make sure that all the Jewish dead are counted? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1142.6599999999999s)]
*  Are remembered. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1146.6599999999999s)]
*  If you don't remember a life, it's as if they never lived at all. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1147.6599999999999s)]
*  Most academics dispute Roberts' estimate of the death toll. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1152.6599999999999s)]
*  But partly as a result of those disagreements, last year the British government appointed [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1156.98s)]
*  a team of researchers to comb through archives across Europe and more accurately count the [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1162.14s)]
*  number of prisoners who died on Alderney. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1168.8s)]
*  Dr. Gillie Carr, an archaeologist at Cambridge University, is coordinating the review. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1171.42s)]
*  Why is this just a document search, not a dig? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1178.68s)]
*  It is likely that some of the people in mass graves were Jewish and according to halakha [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1182.76s)]
*  or Jewish law you cannot disturb the dead. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1188.36s)]
*  But the second reason is that according to prisoner statements some people were dumped [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1191.84s)]
*  at sea or thrown off cliffs. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1198.64s)]
*  What are we going to do? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1200.92s)]
*  Dig up the entire island? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1201.92s)]
*  Well we can't do that. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1202.92s)]
*  The researchers are drawing on rich material. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1204.46s)]
*  The Nazis were meticulous record keepers and British archives contained first-hand [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1207.84s)]
*  testimonies from survivors. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1213.56s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1216.1599999999999s)]
*  We were beaten with everything they could lay their hands on with sticks, spades, pickaxes. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1217.36s)]
*  It sounds absolutely ghastly. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1225.08s)]
*  On certain days, five to six, up to ten men died. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1227.24s)]
*  Dr. Carr told us there's no evidence that gas chambers were used on Alderney, but there [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1233.04s)]
*  were summary executions and the prisoners built the Nazi fortifications on starvation [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1238.04s)]
*  rations. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1244.44s)]
*  Were they taken to Alderney to be worked to death? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1245.44s)]
*  They were certainly seen as expendable. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1249.36s)]
*  The aim was to get every ounce of work out of them and if they died it didn't matter [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1251.3999999999999s)]
*  and that was kind of perhaps expected. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1255.24s)]
*  They were disposable human beings. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1257.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1259.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1260.6399999999999s)]
*  How did your father end up in Alderney? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1261.64s)]
*  At a pub in the Channel Islands we met Gary Font. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1264.92s)]
*  His father, Francisco Font, fought on the losing side in the Spanish Civil War, was [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1269.0600000000002s)]
*  arrested in France, handed over to the Germans and sent to a concentration camp on Alderney. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1275.0400000000002s)]
*  Francisco survived and later married a British woman, Gary's mother. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1281.96s)]
*  He witnessed the execution of a young Soviet boy who decided to leave the working detail [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1287.32s)]
*  and to change his footwear. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1294.52s)]
*  So he decided to pick up these paper bags and wrap them around his feet and then tie [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1296.6s)]
*  them with string and an SS guard had seen him do this and walked up to him and shot [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1301.6799999999998s)]
*  him point blank range. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1307.4199999999998s)]
*  Gary told us his father's experiences left him scarred. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1309.56s)]
*  I saw the emotion on his face. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1314.6s)]
*  It was a tough one. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1322.6s)]
*  Do you think that emotion came from that he had survived the war in Spain and survived [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1326.0s)]
*  the camp here? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1331.12s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1332.12s)]
*  It was the first time I realised, wow, this man has a deep-rooted emotion inside him that [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1333.12s)]
*  he could never get out. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1340.36s)]
*  The British government's effort to get the truth out by recounting the dead was commissioned [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1342.16s)]
*  by Lord Pickles. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1348.0s)]
*  Sir Eric Pickles! [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1349.8000000000002s)]
*  A former cabinet minister and now the UK's envoy for post-Holocaust issues. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1352.0s)]
*  The figures vary, not by a few hundred, not by a few thousand, but by tens of thousands. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1357.2s)]
*  So it was the controversy that prompted you to commission the review? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1363.3200000000002s)]
*  Yes, it seemed to me that the sensible thing was, well, okay, let's do this in the open, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1368.16s)]
*  let's do it fully transparent. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1374.0800000000002s)]
*  He's also asked the researchers to put names to as many of those killed as they can. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1376.0800000000002s)]
*  If you remember them as individuals, then it's another blow against Hitler. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1381.92s)]
*  Hitler wanted to eradicate the memory of people. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1388.0800000000002s)]
*  So this is kind of an ongoing fight against Hitler and his ideas. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1391.5600000000002s)]
*  Hitler's evil hand still continues to affect Europe and to affect the world. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1398.36s)]
*  But it's taken nearly 80 years for the British government to re-examine what happened on [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1406.0s)]
*  Alderney and to make its report public. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1411.36s)]
*  The official British investigations in 1945 were classified for decades. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  And unlike the trials of Nazi officials in Nuremberg, the British authorities failed [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1420.68s)]
*  to prosecute a single German officer who worked on Alderney, even though many of them [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1425.88s)]
*  ended up in British prisoner of war camps. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1431.2s)]
*  Just to be clear, these are possible war criminals. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1434.68s)]
*  The British government has gathered evidence against them. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1437.44s)]
*  And they are in British custody? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1440.8000000000002s)]
*  Yes, they are at this point, yes. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1442.5200000000002s)]
*  A sort of slam dunk case? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1444.7600000000002s)]
*  You'd have thought. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1447.2800000000002s)]
*  That's led Marcus Roberts and others to claim that the British government tried to cover [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1448.72s)]
*  up the extent of the atrocities on Alderney. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1453.64s)]
*  Dr Carr told us that could be true, but one key document from the British War Office investigation [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1456.76s)]
*  that may explain why there were no prosecutions is missing. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1463.56s)]
*  It could have been shredded decades ago as part of what do we need these files for anymore. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1468.16s)]
*  But could it also have been shredded for more nefarious purposes? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1476.08s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1479.68s)]
*  In order for me to say there was a cover-up, I want to see the decisions taken. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1481.16s)]
*  I want to look through those steps and to make up my own mind. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1488.3200000000002s)]
*  Why might the British government have tried to cover up or whitewash what happened on [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1492.3200000000002s)]
*  Alderney and maybe more broadly on the Channel Islands? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1498.8000000000002s)]
*  There are some things that happened that might not, that the British government might not [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1502.28s)]
*  necessarily have wanted a wider audience to know about. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1508.04s)]
*  Those things, once feared too troubling for the broader public, happened on three of the [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1511.68s)]
*  other Channel Islands, where most residents did not evacuate before the occupation. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1517.12s)]
*  When the Germans arrived, the locals mostly cooperated, often with little choice. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1522.96s)]
*  Hitler's portrait was hung outside this cinema on the island of Guernsey. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1529.32s)]
*  Nazi propaganda showed the British police working for German troops. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1533.84s)]
*  And British newspapers on the islands printed orders from Berlin. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1539.08s)]
*  This is a British newspaper and it's got the swastika on top. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1543.6399999999999s)]
*  At the official archives on the island of Jersey, Linda Romerill showed us how British [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1548.04s)]
*  officials implemented Nazi policies, asking Jewish residents to identify themselves and [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1552.9199999999998s)]
*  then confiscating their assets. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1559.76s)]
*  There was a huge amount of requisitioning of people's houses, people's property during [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1562.1200000000001s)]
*  the occupation period. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1568.2s)]
*  But some resisted, risking punishment to paint anti-Nazi graffiti and illegally listening [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1570.3600000000001s)]
*  to British news on the radio. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1577.72s)]
*  That's my great aunt Louisa. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1580.96s)]
*  I suspect that she was probably quite steely. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1583.24s)]
*  One member of the resistance was Louisa Gould, who hid an escaped Russian prisoner in her [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1586.92s)]
*  home for nearly two years. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1593.1200000000001s)]
*  Jenny Lacote told us when her great aunt Louisa was finally caught, she was sent to Ravensbrück [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1596.92s)]
*  concentration camp in Germany. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1603.1200000000001s)]
*  She was killed in a Nazi gas chamber. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1605.8400000000001s)]
*  She was gassed to death, yeah. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1608.2s)]
*  After the occupation, did the British government get in touch with your family to talk about [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1610.3600000000001s)]
*  what Louisa had done during the occupation and about her murder by the Nazis? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1616.76s)]
*  The British government, I think, were kind of ashamed. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1622.6399999999999s)]
*  They were horrified that it had happened and they didn't really want to get too involved [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1626.84s)]
*  in what had gone on there. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1632.08s)]
*  Not wanting to talk about the resistance or not wanting to talk about the occupation at all? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1633.76s)]
*  Well, it was such a mixed picture. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1639.32s)]
*  There were people who had resisted the Germans as much as resistance was possible within [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1641.0s)]
*  a tiny 9 by 5 mile island. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1645.48s)]
*  And there were also people who'd collaborated. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1649.0s)]
*  Some people had betrayed their own country. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1651.24s)]
*  The only possible legislation was treason, which was still a hanging offence. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1654.1200000000001s)]
*  They didn't want to get into that. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1658.3200000000002s)]
*  That was the confusing, messy, dirty mixed picture of the Channel Islands occupation. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1659.8s)]
*  More of that messy, dirty history was revealed when the British government published its [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1666.72s)]
*  review in May. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1671.8s)]
*  According to the new count, over a thousand may have died in the camps. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1673.68s)]
*  Predictably, it hasn't satisfied everyone. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1678.04s)]
*  Some kind of apology and moral recompense would be helpful. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1680.76s)]
*  You want the British government to apologise for not having prosecuted alleged war criminals? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1686.2s)]
*  Yes, I think it would be appropriate for them to recognise what should have been done didn't happen. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1691.28s)]
*  The horrors carried out on this tiny, remote island are difficult to imagine. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1698.28s)]
*  The victims were silenced and buried. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1705.0s)]
*  But now, nearly eight decades later, they're finally being counted. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1708.44s)]
*  For many high school students returning to class this month, it may seem like geometry [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1715.44s)]
*  and trigonometry were created by the Greeks as a form of torture. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1731.28s)]
*  So imagine our amazement when we heard two high school seniors had proved a mathematical [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1735.88s)]
*  puzzle that was thought to be impossible for 2,000 years. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1741.78s)]
*  We met Kelsie Johnson and Nakaiya Jackson at their all-girls Catholic high school in [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1746.46s)]
*  New Orleans. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1751.54s)]
*  And as we first reported this past spring, we expected to find two mathematical prodigies. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1752.8999999999999s)]
*  Instead, we found at St. Mary's Academy, all students are told their possibilities are [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1758.82s)]
*  boundless. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1765.54s)]
*  Come Mardi Gras season, New Orleans is alive with colourful parades, replete with floats [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1772.78s)]
*  and beads and high school marching bands. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1779.62s)]
*  In a city where uniqueness is celebrated, St. Mary's stands out, with young African [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1784.3s)]
*  American women playing trombones and tubas, twirling batons and dancing, doing it all. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1789.2s)]
*  Which defines St. Mary's, students told us. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1795.3799999999999s)]
*  Junior Christina Blasio says the school instills in them they have the ability to accomplish [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1798.38s)]
*  anything. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1804.92s)]
*  That is kind of a standard here, so we aim very high. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1806.5s)]
*  Like, our aim is excellence for all students. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1809.66s)]
*  The private Catholic elementary and high school sits behind the Sisters of the Holy Family [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1813.14s)]
*  Convent in New Orleans East. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1818.0200000000002s)]
*  The academy was started by an African American nun for young black women just after the Civil [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1820.5400000000002s)]
*  War. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1826.24s)]
*  The convent still supports the school with the help of alumni. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1827.42s)]
*  In December 2022, seniors Nakia Jackson and Kelsie Johnson were working on a school-wide [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1831.5800000000002s)]
*  math contest that came with a cash prize. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1838.3000000000002s)]
*  I was motivated because there was a monetary incentive because I was like, $500 is a lot [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1842.18s)]
*  of money, so I would like to at least try. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1847.5600000000002s)]
*  Both were staring down the thorny bonus question. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1850.8200000000002s)]
*  So tell me, what was this bonus question? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1854.76s)]
*  It was to create a new proof of the Pythagorean Theorem, and it kind of gave you a few guidelines [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1859.36s)]
*  on how would you start a proof. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1864.86s)]
*  The seniors were familiar with the Pythagorean Theorem, a fundamental principle of geometry. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1866.8799999999999s)]
*  You may remember it from high school. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1872.84s)]
*  A squared plus B squared equals C squared. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1874.96s)]
*  In plain English, when you know the length of two sides of a right triangle, you can [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1878.44s)]
*  figure out the length of the third. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1883.24s)]
*  Both had studied geometry and some trigonometry, and both told us math was not easy. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1885.88s)]
*  What no one told them was there'd been more than 300 documented proofs of the Pythagorean [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1892.64s)]
*  Theorem using algebra and geometry. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1898.3400000000001s)]
*  But for 2,000 years, a proof using trigonometry was thought to be impossible. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1901.52s)]
*  And that was the bonus question facing them. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1908.1200000000001s)]
*  When you looked at the question, did you think, boy, this is hard? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1911.44s)]
*  What motivated you to say, well, I'm going to try this? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1918.16s)]
*  I think I was like, I started something. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1920.72s)]
*  I need to finish it. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1923.4s)]
*  So you just kept on going? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1924.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1926.4s)]
*  For two months that winter, they spent almost all their free time working on the proof. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1927.4s)]
*  She was like, Mom, this is a little bit too much. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1933.52s)]
*  CeCe and Cal Johnson are Calcie's parents. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1936.92s)]
*  So then I started looking at what she really was doing, and it was pages and pages and [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1939.6s)]
*  pages of like over 20 or 30 pages for this one problem. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1945.12s)]
*  The other guy was full of papers where she would work out the problems. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1949.12s)]
*  And if that didn't work, she would ball it up, throw it in the trash. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1953.44s)]
*  Did you look at the problem? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1957.72s)]
*  Nellisca Jackson is Nakaiya's mother. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1960.0s)]
*  Personally, I did not, because most of the time I don't understand what she's doing. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1963.0s)]
*  What if we did this? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1969.48s)]
*  What if I write this? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1970.48s)]
*  Does this help? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1971.48s)]
*  A, X squared? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1972.48s)]
*  Their math teacher, Michelle Blue and Williams, initiated the math contest. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1973.48s)]
*  And did you think anyone would solve it? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1977.52s)]
*  Well, I wasn't necessarily looking for a solve, so no idea. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1979.84s)]
*  What were you looking for? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1982.64s)]
*  I was just looking for some ingenuity, you know. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1983.64s)]
*  Calcie and Nakaiya delivered on that. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1987.8s)]
*  They tried to explain their groundbreaking work to 60 Minutes. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1990.6s)]
*  Calcie's proof is appropriately titled The Waffle Cone. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1994.84s)]
*  To start the proof, we start with just a regular right triangle where the angle in the corner [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=1998.88s)]
*  is 90 degrees and the two angles are alpha and beta. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2003.44s)]
*  So then what we do next is we draw a second congruent, which means they're equal in size. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2008.04s)]
*  But then we start creating similar but smaller right triangles going in a pattern like this. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2014.76s)]
*  And then it continues for infinity. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2021.92s)]
*  And eventually it creates this larger waffle cone shape. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2023.72s)]
*  Am I going a little too... [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2027.2s)]
*  You've been beyond me since the beginning. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2028.52s)]
*  Oh. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2030.64s)]
*  So how did you figure out the proof? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2032.64s)]
*  Okay, so we have a right triangle, 90 degree angle, alpha and beta. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2034.92s)]
*  Then what did you do? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2039.92s)]
*  Okay, I have a right triangle inside of the circle and I have a perpendicular bisector [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2040.92s)]
*  at OP to divide the triangle to make that small right triangle. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2049.28s)]
*  And that's basically what I use for the proof. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2054.92s)]
*  That's the proof. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2058.92s)]
*  That's what I call amazing. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2059.92s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2061.92s)]
*  There had been one other documented proof of the theorem using trigonometry by mathematician [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2063.92s)]
*  Jason Zimba in 2009, one in 2,000 years. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2068.52s)]
*  Now, it seems, Nakaiya and Calcie have joined perhaps the most exclusive club in mathematics. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2072.92s)]
*  So you both independently came up with proof that only use trigonometry. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2079.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2087.92s)]
*  So are you math geniuses? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2088.92s)]
*  I think that's a stretch. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2092.92s)]
*  If not genius, you're really smart at math. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2094.92s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2097.92s)]
*  To document Calcie and Nakaiya's work, math teachers at St. Mary's submitted their proofs [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2099.92s)]
*  at an American Mathematical Society conference in Atlanta in March 2023. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2105.92s)]
*  Well, our teacher approached us and was like, hey, you might be able to actually present this. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2110.92s)]
*  I was like, are you joking? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2114.92s)]
*  But she wasn't. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2116.92s)]
*  So we went, I got up there, we presented, and it went well, and it blew up. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2118.92s)]
*  It blew up. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2124.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2125.92s)]
*  What was the blow up like? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2126.92s)]
*  Insane, unexpected, crazy, honestly. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2129.92s)]
*  Today's story features two high school students, Calcie Johnson and Nakaiya Jackson. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2133.92s)]
*  It took millennia to prove, but just a minute for word of their accomplishment to go around the world. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2138.92s)]
*  They got a write-up in South Korea and a shout-out from former First Lady Michelle Obama, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2145.92s)]
*  a commendation from the governor, and keys to the city of New Orleans. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2151.92s)]
*  Why do you think so many people found what you did to be so impressive? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2156.92s)]
*  Probably because we're African-American, one, and we're also women. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2160.92s)]
*  So I think, oh, and our age, of course, our age has probably played a big part. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2164.92s)]
*  So you think people were surprised that young African-American women could do such a thing? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2169.92s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2174.92s)]
*  I'd like it to actually be celebrated for what it is. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2175.92s)]
*  Like, it's a great mathematical achievement. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2178.92s)]
*  Achievement, that's a word you hear often around St. Mary's Academy. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2181.92s)]
*  Calcie and Nakaiya follow a long line of barrier-breaking graduates. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2186.92s)]
*  The late queen of Creole cooking, Leah Chase, was an alum. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2191.92s)]
*  So was the first African-American female New Orleans police chief, Michelle Woodfork. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2196.92s)]
*  And judge for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, Dana Douglas. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2202.92s)]
*  Math teacher Michelle Bluen-Williams told us Calcie and Nakaiya are typical St. Mary's students. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2207.92s)]
*  They're not unicorns. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2214.92s)]
*  No. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2215.92s)]
*  If they are unicorns, then every single lady that has matriculated through this school is a beautiful black unicorn. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2216.92s)]
*  You good? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2224.92s)]
*  Pamela Rogers, St. Mary's president and interim principal, told us the students hear that message from the moment they walk in the door. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2225.92s)]
*  We believe all students can succeed. All students can learn. It does not matter the environment that you live in. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2234.92s)]
*  So when word went out that two of your students had solved this almost impossible math problem, were they universally applauded? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2242.92s)]
*  In this community, they were greatly applauded. Across the country, there were many naysayers. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2252.92s)]
*  What were they saying? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2259.92s)]
*  They were saying, oh, they could not have done it. African-Americans don't have the brains to do it. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2260.92s)]
*  Of course, we sheltered our girls from that, but we absolutely did not expect it to come in the volume that it came. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2265.92s)]
*  And after such a wonderful achievement? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2274.92s)]
*  People have a vision of who can be successful. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2278.92s)]
*  And to some people, it is not always an African-American female. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2284.92s)]
*  And to us, it's always an African-American female. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2292.92s)]
*  What we know is when teachers lay out some expectations that say, you can do this, kids will work as hard as they can to do it. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2296.92s)]
*  Gloria Ladson-Billings, professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin, has studied how best to teach African-American students. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2307.92s)]
*  She told us an encouraging teacher can change a life. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2316.92s)]
*  And what's the difference, say, between having a teacher like that and a whole school dedicated to the excellence of these students? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2320.92s)]
*  So a whole school is almost like being in heaven. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2332.92s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2335.92s)]
*  Many of our young people have their ceilings lowered. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2337.92s)]
*  That somewhere around fourth or fifth grade, their thoughts are, I'm not going to be anything special. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2342.92s)]
*  What I think is probably happening at St. Mary's is young women come in as perhaps ninth graders in our toll. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2350.92s)]
*  Here's what we expect to happen. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2357.92s)]
*  And here's how we're going to help you get there. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2359.92s)]
*  Who is the author of this story? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2361.92s)]
*  At St. Mary's, half the students get scholarships subsidized by fundraising to defray the $8,000 a year tuition. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2363.92s)]
*  Here, there's no test to get in. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2371.92s)]
*  But expectations are high and rules are strict. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2374.92s)]
*  No cell phones, modest skirts, hair must be its natural color. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2378.92s)]
*  Students Raya Siddique, Summer Ford, Carissa Washington, Tatum Williams, and Christina Blasio told us they appreciate the rules and rigor. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2383.92s)]
*  Especially the standards that they set for us, they're very high. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2394.92s)]
*  And I don't think that's ever going to change. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2397.92s)]
*  So is there a heart of philosophy and essence to St. Mary's? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2399.92s)]
*  The sisterhood. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2404.92s)]
*  The sisterhood. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2406.92s)]
*  The sisterhood. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2407.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2408.92s)]
*  And you don't mean the nuns. You mean you. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2409.92s)]
*  So when you're here, there's just no question that you're going to go on to college. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2411.92s)]
*  College is all they talk about. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2417.92s)]
*  And Arizona State University. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2419.92s)]
*  Principal Rogers announces to her 615 students the colleges where every senior has been accepted. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2422.92s)]
*  So for 17 years, you've had a 100% graduation rate and a 100% college acceptance rate. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2430.92s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2439.92s)]
*  Nakaiya Jackson. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2440.92s)]
*  Last year when Nakaiya and Kelsey graduated, all their classmates went to college and got scholarships. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2442.92s)]
*  Nakaiya got a full ride to the pharmacy school at Xavier University in New Orleans. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2449.92s)]
*  Kelsey, the class valedictorian, is studying environmental engineering at Louisiana State University. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2454.92s)]
*  So wait a minute, neither one of you is going to pursue a career in math? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2461.92s)]
*  No. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2465.92s)]
*  I may take up a minor in math, but I don't want that to be my job job. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2466.92s)]
*  People might expect too much out of me if I'm a mathematician. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2472.92s)]
*  But math is not completely in their rearview mirrors. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2477.92s)]
*  This spring, they submitted their high school proofs for final peer review and publication [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2481.92s)]
*  and are still working on further proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2487.92s)]
*  Since their first two... [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2491.92s)]
*  We found five and then we found a general format that could potentially produce at least five additional proofs. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2493.92s)]
*  And you're not math geniuses? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2499.92s)]
*  No, no. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2501.92s)]
*  I'm not buying it. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2503.92s)]
*  The inspiration for St. Mary's Academy. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2510.92s)]
*  We continue to move forward with her vision. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2513.92s)]
*  At 60minutesovertime.com [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2516.92s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2524.92s)]
*  We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2526.92s)]
*  So when you look out there and you see all that green, what do you think? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2540.92s)]
*  I see money leaving America. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2543.92s)]
*  Pure insanity. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2545.92s)]
*  You're noticing mis and disinformation on your own social media. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2546.92s)]
*  This is the world we're taking in and we can make impacts and try to improve it. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2550.92s)]
*  Is this a battle of rich versus poor? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2558.92s)]
*  In part it is. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2560.92s)]
*  Black versus white? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2561.92s)]
*  In part it is. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2562.92s)]
*  If you're not willing to protect a place like this, then what are you willing to protect? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2564.92s)]
*  Go for me, go for three, one, two, three. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2574.92s)]
*  Go! [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2576.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2577.92s)]
*  I want a strong America. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2578.92s)]
*  I want a proud America. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JEyDD2vN5Q&t=2579.92s)]
