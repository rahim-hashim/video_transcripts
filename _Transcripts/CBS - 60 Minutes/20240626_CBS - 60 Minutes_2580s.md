# Crisis in the Red Sea; The Looting of Cambodia | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk)
*  Global trade has been severely disrupted in the Red Sea by a dangerous militia in Yemen, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=0.0s)]
*  who the U.S. Navy is trying to stop. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=15.52s)]
*  When was the last time that the U.S. Navy operated at this pace for a couple months? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=17.52s)]
*  I think you'd have to go back to World War II, where you have ships who are engaged in combat. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=25.04s)]
*  When I say engaged in combat, where they're getting shot at, we're getting shot at, and we're shooting back. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=30.54s)]
*  For a year, 60 Minutes has been investigating the theft of Cambodia's cultural heritage, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=41.54s)]
*  thousands of sacred stone, bronze and gold artifacts from religious sites across the country, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=46.54s)]
*  leaving empty pedestals where gods and deities once stood. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=52.56s)]
*  We found some of them on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=56.56s)]
*  How did these looted treasures get here, and will they ever be returned? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=60.56s)]
*  We are on the verge of returning a number of them. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=65.56s)]
*  All of them? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=69.56s)]
*  That I can't say. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=71.56s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=73.56s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=76.56s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=77.56s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=78.56s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=80.56s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=81.58s)]
*  I'm Nora O'Donnell. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=82.58s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=83.58s)]
*  Those stories tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=85.58s)]
*  After Hamas launched its deadly terrorist attack in Israel this past October, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=96.58s)]
*  and Israel began its unrelenting war in Gaza in response, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=101.58s)]
*  President Biden warned Iran and its proxies in the Middle East to stay out of it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=105.58s)]
*  One of those groups decided instead that it was all in. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=110.6s)]
*  That group is a Shia militia from Yemen, known as the Houthis. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=114.6s)]
*  Yemen is the poorest country in the Middle East, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=119.6s)]
*  but its 1,200 miles of coastline leads in and out of the Suez Canal, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=122.6s)]
*  the primary route by sea between Europe and Asia, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=128.6s)]
*  responsible for a trillion dollars a year in global trade. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=132.6s)]
*  As we first reported in February, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=136.62s)]
*  when the Houthis began to attack commercial ships in solidarity with Hamas, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=138.62s)]
*  President Biden faced a crisis in the Red Sea [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=143.62s)]
*  and sent the U.S. Navy into its first major fight of the 21st century. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=146.62s)]
*  Our report begins not on the water, but in the air. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=156.62s)]
*  Where, from a U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane 500 feet above the Red Sea, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  we saw the types of commercial ships the Houthis have targeted [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  and the U.S. warships sent to protect them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  We are not going to let the Houthis hold this straight hostage. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  Vice Admiral Brad Cooper is the U.S. military's deputy commander in the Middle East. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  After October 7, as the Navy's top officer in the region, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=187.66s)]
*  he ordered the 5th Fleet into an area it typically sailed right through. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=191.66s)]
*  How many sailors are now in the Red Sea? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=196.66s)]
*  We've got about 7,000 right now, so it's a large commitment. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=199.66s)]
*  What makes the Red Sea one of the most important waterways in the world? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=204.66s)]
*  15% of global trade flows exactly through the Red Sea, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=208.66s)]
*  and so keeping these waterways open is critical. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=212.68s)]
*  It's a core commitment the United States has [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=215.68s)]
*  from a strategic perspective, maintaining a free flow of commerce. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=218.68s)]
*  The Red Sea is about the size of California, in the north, the Suez Canal, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=222.68s)]
*  in the south, the 20-mile-wide strait known in Arabic as the Bab el-Mandeb [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=228.68s)]
*  or in English, as the Gate of Grief. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=233.68s)]
*  It was near there seven months after the Red Sea was hit [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=237.68s)]
*  and it was there seven months ago that a Japanese chartered ship [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=241.70000000000002s)]
*  built to carry cars was hijacked by the Houthis, who posted this video. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  Since then, according to the Pentagon, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  the Houthis have launched more than 100 attacks [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  and the U.S. Navy has shot down more than 150 drones and missiles [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=256.7s)]
*  fired by the militia that controls one-third of Yemen, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=260.7s)]
*  including the capital, Sana'a. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=264.7s)]
*  As Houthi attacks intensified in December and January, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=267.7s)]
*  the world's largest container ship companies all made the decision [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  to avoid the Suez and go around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  adding as much as a month of travel time and a million dollars in fuel. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told 60 Minutes in February [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  the diversions pose a risk to the global economy and in the near term... [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  That's going to affect Europe much more than it's going to affect us. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  Tesla and Volvo were both forced to suspend some European production in January [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=297.74s)]
*  due to supply chain disruptions. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=302.74s)]
*  There are still ships going through the Suez, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=305.74s)]
*  mostly smaller regional carriers, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=308.74s)]
*  that are willing to run the current risks of the Red Sea. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=310.74s)]
*  How much is that, in terms of that traffic, has it been reduced by half? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=314.74s)]
*  It's been reduced on any given day, sometimes 40 percent, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=318.74s)]
*  but it's clearly flowing, and I think in many respects it's flowing [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=322.74s)]
*  because of the defensive umbrella that we put over the southern Red Sea, for sure. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=325.76s)]
*  The official name of that defensive umbrella is Operation Prosperity Guardian. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=333.76s)]
*  It's a coalition of more than 20 nations that includes the United Kingdom. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=338.76s)]
*  But most of the ships, aircraft and firepower... [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=343.76s)]
*  are coming from America. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=349.76s)]
*  When was the last time that the U.S. Navy operated at this pace for a couple months? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=351.78s)]
*  I think you'd have to go back to World War II, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=357.78s)]
*  where you have ships who are engaged in combat. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=360.78s)]
*  When I say engaged in combat, where they're getting shot at, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=363.78s)]
*  we're getting shot at and we're shooting back. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=366.78s)]
*  Initially, the Houthis, backed by Iran, stated they would only shoot at ships linked to Israel. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=370.78s)]
*  They would only shoot at ships linked to Israel, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  in support of the Palestinian people and to force a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=380.79999999999995s)]
*  Their ultimate political aims, as well as their actual aim, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  appears to be less precise. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=390.79999999999995s)]
*  They have fired at ships tied to dozens of nations. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  The Houthis' official motto is God is great, death to America, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  death to Israel, a curse upon the Jews, victory to Islam. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=403.82s)]
*  While their slogan may not be new, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=408.82s)]
*  their weapons and tactics are, according to Admiral Cooper. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=411.82s)]
*  The Houthis are the first entity in the history of the world [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=416.82s)]
*  to use anti-ship ballistic missiles ever firing against shipping. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=419.82s)]
*  No one has ever used... [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=423.82s)]
*  No one has ever used an anti-ship ballistic missile, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=424.82s)]
*  certainly against commercial shipping, much less against U.S. Navy ships. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=427.82s)]
*  Admiral Cooper took us inside the 5th Fleet's command center [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=431.84s)]
*  at Naval headquarters in Bahrain. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=434.84s)]
*  I think there's a sense that the Houthis are sort of like a rag-tag kind of terrorist group. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=437.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=442.84s)]
*  That can be a sense and it would be a false sense [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=443.84s)]
*  and we would be unwise to consider that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=445.84s)]
*  You know, 10 years of being supplied by the Iranians, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=448.84s)]
*  very sophisticated advanced weapons. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=451.84s)]
*  They have hit a few ships. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=454.84s)]
*  Of those targets, how many of them are directed at U.S. Naval assets? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=456.84s)]
*  The overwhelming majority over these last couple of months [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=460.85999999999996s)]
*  have been directed at internationally flagged merchant ships. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=462.85999999999996s)]
*  A small percentage of them are directly at U.S. Navy ships. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=466.85999999999996s)]
*  What kind of damage would one of those anti-ship ballistic missiles do on a commercial ship? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=469.85999999999996s)]
*  Well, let's go right here. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=474.85999999999996s)]
*  This is exactly what it looks like. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=475.85999999999996s)]
*  The Houthis attacked it and you can see in practical terms what the damage was. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=476.85999999999996s)]
*  The Houthis also have inexpensive Iranian-designed attack drones in their arsenal, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=482.85999999999996s)]
*  like the 15-foot wide Samad, with a range of up to 1,100 miles. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=487.88s)]
*  Some of their anti-ship ballistic missiles resemble the Iranian weapons seen here [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=492.88s)]
*  and can hit targets up to about 300 miles away. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=497.88s)]
*  If there is an anti-ship ballistic missile launch, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=501.88s)]
*  this ballistic missile travels at about Mach 5, about 3,000 miles an hour. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=503.88s)]
*  How much time is there between a Houthi launch and then it couldn't reach a U.S. ship? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=508.88s)]
*  If it's coming toward them, now just put yourself in the seat of the destroyer captain on that ship. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=514.9s)]
*  He has about 9 to 15 seconds to make a decision if they're going to shoot that down. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=518.9s)]
*  It's intense. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=522.9s)]
*  To speak to one of those destroyer captains deployed in the southern Red Sea, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=525.9s)]
*  we took a five-mile helicopter ride from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower over to the USS Mason, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=529.9s)]
*  where we met Commander Justin Smith. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=539.9s)]
*  The destroyer is one of four American warships in the area [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=541.92s)]
*  that have shot down 20 of the Houthi's anti-ship ballistic missiles. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=544.92s)]
*  How quickly can you see those? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=550.92s)]
*  Anywhere from one to two minutes out. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=552.92s)]
*  And providing me that decision space to give me the 9 to 15 seconds [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=554.92s)]
*  as the captain of this ship on what my actions are going to be. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=559.92s)]
*  You made it sound like that's a lot of time, 9 to 15 seconds. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=563.92s)]
*  It doesn't sound like much. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=566.92s)]
*  It seems very small, but it's very powerful. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=567.92s)]
*  It seems very small and very short in duration, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=570.9399999999999s)]
*  but my crew has that ready proficiency to be able to engage. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=572.9399999999999s)]
*  We learned that so far, the Navy has fired more than 100 of their standard surface-to-air missiles [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=578.9399999999999s)]
*  that can cost as much as $4 million each. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=585.9399999999999s)]
*  The decision to fire one at an incoming Houthi missile, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=590.9399999999999s)]
*  or Kamikaze attack drone, is made in the ship's Combat Information Center, or CIC. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=593.9399999999999s)]
*  We can be attacked at any time, in any place. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=600.9399999999999s)]
*  That's where Commander Smith showed us a video of the USS Mason doing just that. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=604.9399999999999s)]
*  You see an intercept here followed by a quick explosion showing a successful engagement. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=609.9399999999999s)]
*  The weapon systems that you have on board here, and specifically the standard missiles, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=615.9399999999999s)]
*  those are expensive weapons, and you're using them to shoot down $10,000 drones. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=620.9399999999999s)]
*  Is that worth it? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=627.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't think you could put a price tag on safety and the defense of our sailors on board. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=628.96s)]
*  You have to be right 100% of the time. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=634.96s)]
*  They just have to get right once. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=637.96s)]
*  A day before our visit to the USS Mason, about 100 miles away, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=642.96s)]
*  another U.S. destroyer needed its weapon of last resort. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=646.96s)]
*  A defensive cannon called a SeaWiz to shoot down a Houthi cruise missile [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=650.96s)]
*  that was a mile out and closing fast. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=655.96s)]
*  Most U.S. warships have one of these gun systems, seen here in exercises. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=658.96s)]
*  The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower has two. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=665.96s)]
*  On that ship, with its 5,000 sailors and more than 75 aircraft, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=671.96s)]
*  strike group commander Rear Admiral Mark Miguez told us [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=680.96s)]
*  the Houthis have proven to be resourceful adversaries. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=684.96s)]
*  There are the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance drones [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=687.98s)]
*  that the Houthis are launching. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=691.98s)]
*  How have you seen them use? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=692.98s)]
*  When we first got to this area, that we would detect the drone, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=694.98s)]
*  and then all of a sudden, 10 minutes later or 5 minutes later, there was an attack. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=700.98s)]
*  In other words, a ballistic missile being launched or a cruise missile being launched. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=707.98s)]
*  And we've deduced over time that they are obviously using these drones [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=712.0s)]
*  to perfect their targeting solution. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=717.0s)]
*  Since the war in Israel and Gaza began, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=720.0s)]
*  other Iranian-backed militias have targeted U.S. forces in Jordan, Iraq, and Syria [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=723.0s)]
*  with at least 175 attacks that injured 183 service members and killed three. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=730.0s)]
*  Admiral Miguez told us so far the USS Eisenhower has only been focused on the Houthis [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=738.02s)]
*  in the southern Red Sea. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=745.02s)]
*  Since January 11th, its planes have been regularly striking their launch sites in Yemen, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=746.02s)]
*  as have U.S. destroyers. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=752.02s)]
*  The U.S. also conducted a cyberattack on an Iranian spy ship [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=756.02s)]
*  that was gathering intelligence in and around the Red Sea. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=761.02s)]
*  But the Houthi attacks keep coming. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=764.02s)]
*  Could the Houthis do this without Iranian support? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=767.04s)]
*  No. For a decade, the Iranians have been supplying the Houthis. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=770.04s)]
*  They've been resupplying them. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=774.04s)]
*  They're resupplying them as we sit here right now at sea. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=776.04s)]
*  We know this is happening. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=781.04s)]
*  They're advising them and they're providing targeting information. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=782.04s)]
*  This is crystal clear. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=784.04s)]
*  Are there members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=786.04s)]
*  that are actually on the ground in Yemen providing intelligence and targeting? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=791.04s)]
*  The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps is inside Yemen [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=796.06s)]
*  and they are serving side by side with the Houthis, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=800.06s)]
*  advising them and providing targeting information. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=803.06s)]
*  And so what have we done to degrade that capability? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=805.06s)]
*  That will obviously end up being a policy decision. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=809.06s)]
*  Our role at this point is to simply be ready and continue to be aggressive [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=812.06s)]
*  in exercising our right to self-defense. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=817.06s)]
*  Do these offensive U.S. airstrikes against these Houthi targets in Yemen [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=819.0799999999999s)]
*  risk escalating this conflict? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=824.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=828.0799999999999s)]
*  We're targeting those platforms that are targeting us. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=829.0799999999999s)]
*  If we were to look at the calendar, right, since October 7th, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=832.0799999999999s)]
*  the surging of U.S. forces to the Red Sea, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=838.0799999999999s)]
*  and yet they keep firing back, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=843.0799999999999s)]
*  they keep seeming to be opportunistic in their response. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=845.1s)]
*  Is the U.S. Navy, the 5th Fleet, are the actions having an effect? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=850.1s)]
*  It's very clear that we are degrading their capability [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=855.1s)]
*  and every single day they attempt to attack us, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=860.1s)]
*  we're eliminating and disrupting them in ways that are meaningful [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=863.1s)]
*  and I do believe have an impact. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=867.1s)]
*  How long does this go on? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=869.1s)]
*  Well, I have a pretty clear endgame in mind, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=871.1s)]
*  and that is the restoration of the free flow of commerce [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=873.12s)]
*  and safe navigation of the Southern Red Sea. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=876.12s)]
*  Four months after our report first aired, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=880.12s)]
*  the Houthis are still on the attack in the Red Sea. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=883.12s)]
*  So far they have sunk two cargo ships, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=887.12s)]
*  the second just this past week. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=890.12s)]
*  Overall, shipping traffic remains about half of what it was [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=893.12s)]
*  before the attacks began. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=897.12s)]
*  What's the secret weapon on the USS Eisenhower? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=903.12s)]
*  Morale is the most important thing. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=907.12s)]
*  At 60minutesovertime.com [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=909.12s)]
*  The theft of Cambodia's cultural treasures, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=916.12s)]
*  thousands of sacred stone, bronze and gold artifacts [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=919.12s)]
*  from religious sites across the country [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=922.12s)]
*  might just be the greatest art heist in history. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=924.12s)]
*  It began nearly a century ago when Cambodia was colonized by France, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=927.12s)]
*  but in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=932.14s)]
*  amidst genocide, civil war and political turmoil, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=934.14s)]
*  the looting became a global business, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=937.14s)]
*  much of it run by a British man named Douglas Latchford. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=940.14s)]
*  He kept some of it for himself, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=944.14s)]
*  but much of what his gang of thieves stole, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=946.14s)]
*  Latchford then sold to wealthy private collectors [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=948.14s)]
*  and some of the most important museums around the world. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=951.14s)]
*  As we first reported in December, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=954.14s)]
*  Cambodia's government has spent the last 10 years [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=956.14s)]
*  trying to track it all down [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=959.16s)]
*  and bring their history and heritage home. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=961.16s)]
*  Angkor Wat, with its towering spires, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=966.16s)]
*  is the glory of Cambodia. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=968.16s)]
*  Nearly a thousand years old, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=970.16s)]
*  it's one of the biggest and most extraordinary [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=972.16s)]
*  religious temples in the world, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=974.16s)]
*  sprawling across 400 acres. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=976.16s)]
*  Originally built to honor the Hindu god Vishnu, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=979.16s)]
*  it then became a Buddhist temple [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=982.16s)]
*  and remains a place of worship today. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=984.16s)]
*  You can wander here for weeks, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=987.18s)]
*  lost in a labyrinth of ancient stone corridors [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=989.18s)]
*  and sacred chambers, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=992.18s)]
*  but the scars of plunder run deep. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=994.18s)]
*  Looters have hacked off the heads of many statues. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=996.18s)]
*  They've stolen bodies as well. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=999.18s)]
*  Empty pedestals mark where gods and deities once stood. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1001.18s)]
*  On some, only the feet remain. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1005.18s)]
*  It's worse in the rest of Cambodia's 4,000 temples. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1011.18s)]
*  Nearly all have been looted. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1014.18s)]
*  This one is 100 miles northeast of Angkor Wat [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1017.18s)]
*  on a remote mountain called Sandak. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1020.18s)]
*  This was hit very heavily by the looting gangs. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1023.18s)]
*  They found gold, they found statues, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1026.18s)]
*  they found many, many things. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1028.18s)]
*  That's Brad Gordon, an American lawyer [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1030.18s)]
*  who's been working for the Cambodian government [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1032.18s)]
*  for 10 years, tracking down its stolen treasures. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1034.18s)]
*  He brought us to Sandak with his team of investigators, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1038.18s)]
*  archaeologists and art scholars. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1041.18s)]
*  This is so cool. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1044.18s)]
*  In the temple's crumbling courtyard, little remains, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1045.2s)]
*  mostly empty pedestals scattered among the sralao trees. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1048.2s)]
*  It's remarkable to me just how much stuff [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1052.2s)]
*  is just scattered on the ground. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1054.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1056.2s)]
*  It's like a pedestal graveyard. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1057.2s)]
*  We've all seen in museums these statues with no feet on them, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1059.2s)]
*  and I don't think people realize the feet were hacked off [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1064.2s)]
*  because in order to steal them, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1067.2s)]
*  that's the easiest way to get them off the pedestal. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1069.2s)]
*  We know when the looters came to sites like this, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1072.22s)]
*  the first thing they took was the heads. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1074.22s)]
*  That was the easiest to grab. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1076.22s)]
*  And then later on maybe they come back and get the torso, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1078.22s)]
*  but they were not very careful, so they left behind pieces. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1081.22s)]
*  For Cambodians, these statues are not just works of art, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1088.22s)]
*  they are sacred deities that hold the souls of their ancestors [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1091.22s)]
*  to whom they ask for guidance and pray. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1095.22s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1098.22s)]
*  These were all the statues of the ancestors [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1099.22s)]
*  These were all looted? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1101.24s)]
*  Yes, all looted. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1103.24s)]
*  All of these heads cut off? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1105.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1107.24s)]
*  Phu Rung Sakana, Cambodia's minister of culture, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1108.24s)]
*  is in charge of the government's efforts [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1110.24s)]
*  to track down their stolen gods. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1112.24s)]
*  We met her in a closely guarded warehouse [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1115.24s)]
*  not far from Angkor Wat, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1117.24s)]
*  where more than 6,000 pieces from temples across the country [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1119.24s)]
*  are stored for safekeeping, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1122.24s)]
*  each one sculpted by an artisan from an ancient Khmer empire [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1124.24s)]
*  that lasted for more than five centuries [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1128.26s)]
*  and spanned Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1130.26s)]
*  So the statues have a soul. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1134.26s)]
*  The statues are, are they living? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1136.26s)]
*  Of course, yes. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1138.26s)]
*  And we believe that we can talk with them. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1140.26s)]
*  They will hear. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1142.26s)]
*  They will see what do you want, what do you see, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1144.26s)]
*  what do you do in your life, in your house, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1147.26s)]
*  outside in the society also. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1151.26s)]
*  They're watching. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1153.26s)]
*  They're watching everywhere. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1155.26s)]
*  Phu Rung Sakana's entire family was killed [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1157.28s)]
*  in the genocide that began in 1975 [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1160.28s)]
*  when the Khmer Rouge, a radical communist group, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1163.28s)]
*  took over, forcing millions of Cambodians into labor camps. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1166.28s)]
*  Some two million people, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1170.28s)]
*  nearly a quarter of the population, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1172.28s)]
*  were slaughtered or starved to death. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1174.28s)]
*  The Khmer Rouge lost power in 1979, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1177.28s)]
*  but fighting and instability continued for decades, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1180.28s)]
*  leaving Cambodia's temples unprotected and vulnerable. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1183.28s)]
*  Easy targets from scrupulous antiquities dealers [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1186.3s)]
*  like Douglas Latchford. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1189.3s)]
*  Who was Douglas Latchford? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1191.3s)]
*  I would say that he was in many ways the mastermind [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1193.3s)]
*  behind the greatest art heist in history. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1196.3s)]
*  The greatest art heist in history? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1199.3s)]
*  Yes, in terms of scope and multitude of crime sites [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1201.3s)]
*  and the enormous amount of statues that were taken out. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1205.3s)]
*  Latchford lived in Thailand, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1209.3s)]
*  an enigmatic British businessman he began collecting in the 1960s. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1211.3s)]
*  He had, it seems, two great loves, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1215.32s)]
*  Cambodian antiquities and Thai bodybuilders, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1218.32s)]
*  who sponsored Bangkok's biggest bodybuilding competition, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1223.32s)]
*  the Latchford Classic. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1226.32s)]
*  How would you describe him? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1228.32s)]
*  He was extremely deceptive. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1230.32s)]
*  I think in many ways he was ruthless, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1233.32s)]
*  but he hid that behind this incredible facade of charm. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1236.32s)]
*  Latchford portrayed himself as a scholar [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1241.32s)]
*  and protector of Cambodia's culture, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1243.34s)]
*  a reputation he burnished by donating sculptures [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1245.34s)]
*  to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1248.34s)]
*  and other prestigious institutions. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1250.34s)]
*  He also published three books [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1252.34s)]
*  filled with the finest examples of Cambodian antiquities. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1254.34s)]
*  Many of them, it turns out, Latchford had stolen. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1258.34s)]
*  He was using the books as sales catalogs. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1261.34s)]
*  He was handing them out, he was using them to sell pieces, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1264.34s)]
*  and he understood a certain psychology of collectors out there [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1267.34s)]
*  that if they see something in a beautiful book, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1271.36s)]
*  they think it's legitimate. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1274.36s)]
*  You're doing the transcript right now. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1276.36s)]
*  Those books have been an invaluable guide [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1278.36s)]
*  for Brad Gordon and his team, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1280.36s)]
*  helping them compile a database of thousands of missing artifacts, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1282.36s)]
*  many of which they didn't know existed [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1286.36s)]
*  until Latchford published photos of them. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1288.36s)]
*  Gordon's team got their big break when they met this man in 2012. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1290.36s)]
*  He was a former Khmer Rouge child soldier [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1294.36s)]
*  and leader of a gang of looters. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1297.36s)]
*  His name was Day Duck. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1299.3799999999999s)]
*  That first meeting, I didn't really know who we had met. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1301.3799999999999s)]
*  I knew that he was important. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1305.3799999999999s)]
*  I knew that many people were telling me he was the best, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1307.3799999999999s)]
*  and I knew that he was feared. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1311.3799999999999s)]
*  Why were people afraid of him? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1313.3799999999999s)]
*  Over the years, he had killed many people. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1315.3799999999999s)]
*  It turned out Day Duck had worked for decades [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1317.3799999999999s)]
*  supplying Douglas Latchford with thousands of treasures, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1320.3799999999999s)]
*  and he was amazed to see them again in Latchford's books. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1323.3799999999999s)]
*  He kept opening the book and going back to the front cover [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1327.4s)]
*  and going through and tapping and saying, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1331.4s)]
*  I know this one, I know this one, I know this one. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1333.4s)]
*  And when he says he knew this one, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1336.4s)]
*  he helped loot those ones? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1338.4s)]
*  That's what we learned later, yeah. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1341.4s)]
*  Day Duck became a key confidential source for Gordon's team. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1345.4s)]
*  They gave him a code name, Lion, to protect his identity [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1348.4s)]
*  and followed him to dozens of temples [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1352.4s)]
*  where he confessed what he'd found and how he'd stolen it. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1354.42s)]
*  He would say to us, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1357.42s)]
*  I'm going to transfer everything in my head to you. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1359.42s)]
*  I'm going to tell you everything, every secret. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1362.42s)]
*  You felt like his memory was very good, it was accurate? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1365.42s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1368.42s)]
*  He remembered the size of everything, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1369.42s)]
*  measured against his body. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1372.42s)]
*  He would use his arm to show us how long a statue was. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1374.42s)]
*  Why do you think he wanted to cooperate? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1377.42s)]
*  You know, he felt tremendously guilty [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1379.42s)]
*  about many things he had done in his life, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1381.44s)]
*  about the killing, about the looting. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1384.44s)]
*  And we offered him a road of redemption, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1387.44s)]
*  a way to do something really good at the end of his life. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1390.44s)]
*  They recorded hundreds of hours of Lion's testimony. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1396.44s)]
*  He explained how gangs of looters would spend weeks [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1399.44s)]
*  at remote temples using shovels, chisels, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1402.44s)]
*  metal detectors, even dynamite, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1405.44s)]
*  to find and dig out treasures. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1407.44s)]
*  Dozens of men would hoist heavy stone statues [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1409.46s)]
*  onto ox carts before transporting them [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1412.46s)]
*  across the border into Thailand [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1415.46s)]
*  and into the hands of Douglas Latchford. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1417.46s)]
*  Lion never met Latchford, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1420.46s)]
*  but he'd send him photographs of artifacts he could choose from. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1422.46s)]
*  We hear about them saying, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1425.46s)]
*  oh, we had to go to this temple and take a photo [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1427.46s)]
*  and then sending it back. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1429.46s)]
*  You know, my sense is he was shopping. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1431.46s)]
*  He had a list. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1433.46s)]
*  The looters knew his priorities. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1435.46s)]
*  Like these, which came from a temple complex called Kokei, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1437.48s)]
*  the statues from there had a distinctive style [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1441.48s)]
*  that Latchford loved. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1444.48s)]
*  It was, however, a dangerous business. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1446.48s)]
*  Most looters only made enough to buy food for their families, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1449.48s)]
*  and fighting between rival gangs was common. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1452.48s)]
*  People were killed over these antiquities. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1455.48s)]
*  Do you look at these as blood statues? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1458.48s)]
*  Uh, for sure. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1460.48s)]
*  They're blood antiquities. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1462.48s)]
*  Whenever I see a statue, I think about, you know, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1464.5s)]
*  who died to get this out of the ground [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1467.5s)]
*  or get it out of a temple and to move it here? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1470.5s)]
*  So, so much of this looting was done in the shadow of the war, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1473.5s)]
*  shadow of the genocide. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1476.5s)]
*  It was this 500-pound sandstone warrior from Kokei [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1478.5s)]
*  that appeared in a Sotheby's auction catalogue in 2011 [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1481.5s)]
*  that put Douglas Latchford on the radar of U.S. law enforcement. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1484.5s)]
*  Its feet were missing, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1488.5s)]
*  and the price tag? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1490.52s)]
*  An estimated $2 to $3 million. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1492.52s)]
*  When it appeared in the market, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1494.52s)]
*  there were a number of archaeologists, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1496.52s)]
*  a number of people who immediately recognized [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1498.52s)]
*  the source of the statue [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1501.52s)]
*  as being a specific temple in Cambodia. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1504.52s)]
*  It came from Kokei. That's right. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1507.52s)]
*  Until he retired last September, J.P. Labatt was a special agent [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1509.52s)]
*  on the Cultural Property, Art and Antiquities Unit [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1513.52s)]
*  with Homeland Security. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1516.52s)]
*  A team from the U.S. Attorney's Office [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1518.54s)]
*  at the Southern District of New York [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1520.54s)]
*  traveled to Cambodia to inspect the site [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1522.54s)]
*  where the statue had been removed. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1525.54s)]
*  And so the base was still there with the feet still in the ground. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1528.54s)]
*  And so they were able to match that base and feet to the statue. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1532.54s)]
*  And that was enough evidence [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1539.54s)]
*  to get the statue pulled off the market? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1541.54s)]
*  That's right. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1543.54s)]
*  After years of legal wrangling, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1544.54s)]
*  Sotheby's finally agreed to send this stolen warrior back to Cambodia. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1546.56s)]
*  A ceremony was held welcoming it home, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1553.56s)]
*  and investigators were able to trace its original sale [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1555.56s)]
*  back to Douglas Latchford, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1559.56s)]
*  who was asked about its repatriation [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1561.56s)]
*  in a German documentary in 2014. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1563.56s)]
*  Is it a good day for Cambodia [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1565.56s)]
*  or is it a bad day for the art market [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1567.56s)]
*  if these things are coming back? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1569.56s)]
*  It's a good day for Cambodia. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1571.56s)]
*  It's a bad day for the art market. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1573.56s)]
*  Law enforcement in New York was closing in on Latchford, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1575.58s)]
*  but he claimed prosecutors had him all wrong. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1578.58s)]
*  Their imagination has gone wild. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1581.58s)]
*  They've seen too many Indiana Jones films. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1584.58s)]
*  As far as I know, there is no such thing as a smuggling network. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1587.58s)]
*  And I certainly don't belong to any smuggling network. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1592.58s)]
*  The attempted sale of this statue in 2011, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1596.58s)]
*  was that a turning point in the unraveling of Douglas Latchford? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1600.58s)]
*  I would say yes. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1604.6s)]
*  That case put more of a focus and a spotlight on him, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1605.6s)]
*  and then efforts were then doubled [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1609.6s)]
*  to really peel back the onion [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1611.6s)]
*  and look into Latchford's activities. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1613.6s)]
*  The testimony of former looters found by Brad Gordon and his team [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1617.6s)]
*  was critical for the U.S. attorney's case against Latchford. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1621.6s)]
*  How rare is it to actually have access to the looters, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1624.6s)]
*  to people who actually stole these things [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1629.6s)]
*  10, 20, 30 years ago? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1631.6s)]
*  I know of no other case where that's happened. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1633.62s)]
*  And it's quite remarkable to have looters [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1635.62s)]
*  actively assisting a team of investigators [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1639.62s)]
*  to recover artifacts that they had a first hand [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1643.62s)]
*  in helping remove from the country. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1646.62s)]
*  Douglas Latchford was finally indicted by U.S. authorities in 2019 [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1649.62s)]
*  for smuggling, conspiracy, wire fraud and other charges. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1653.62s)]
*  But he died before he could be put on trial. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1657.62s)]
*  Brad Gordon eventually convinced Latchford's family [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1660.6399999999999s)]
*  to return his personal collection of stolen treasures. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1662.6399999999999s)]
*  Among the first pieces to come home in 2021 [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1667.6399999999999s)]
*  was this statue from Koke. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1670.6399999999999s)]
*  Lion, weakened by cancer, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1674.6399999999999s)]
*  came to inspect it in Cambodia's National Museum [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1676.6399999999999s)]
*  to verify it was the same one he'd dug out of the ground. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1679.6399999999999s)]
*  And then he turned to me and he said, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1683.6399999999999s)]
*  it's the real statue. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1686.66s)]
*  You know, it was a remarkable thing to watch. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1687.66s)]
*  And just his relationship, it was living to him. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1690.66s)]
*  Do you think he was happy he was back? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1695.66s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1697.66s)]
*  So happy. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1698.66s)]
*  He knew that he had done something good. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1699.66s)]
*  Lion died a few months later. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1702.66s)]
*  But the secrets he revealed continue to bring statues [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1705.66s)]
*  back to Cambodia's National Museum, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1708.66s)]
*  masterpieces that left a mark on the history of Cambodia. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1710.66s)]
*  There are a lot of these statues still left in the National Museum, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1714.68s)]
*  masterpieces that left the country [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1717.68s)]
*  long before these schoolchildren were born. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1719.68s)]
*  Does the return of these statues, these gods, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1722.68s)]
*  help to heal? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1725.68s)]
*  Yes, to get back the soul of the nation. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1727.68s)]
*  The soul of the nation? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1730.68s)]
*  It's not only for me, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1731.68s)]
*  but also for my family who was died during the war [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1733.68s)]
*  and for all Cambodian people. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1736.68s)]
*  There are still many more stolen Cambodian statues [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1740.68s)]
*  around the world. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1743.68s)]
*  When we return, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1744.88s)]
*  Cambodians fight to get those looted relics back. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1746.0600000000002s)]
*  It's taken a team of Cambodian investigators [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1760.78s)]
*  led by Brad Gordon, an American lawyer, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1763.4s)]
*  more than 10 years to document the theft [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1765.94s)]
*  of thousands of ancient statues and relics [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1768.48s)]
*  by a British collector named Douglas Latchford. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1771.3400000000001s)]
*  As we reported last December, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1774.22s)]
*  they've managed to get some of what he stole back, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1776.14s)]
*  but many of Cambodia's greatest treasures [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1778.8600000000001s)]
*  are still out there, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1781.22s)]
*  hidden away in the mansions of millionaires and billionaires [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1782.7s)]
*  and hiding in plain sight on display [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1786.3200000000002s)]
*  in some of the most prestigious museums around the world. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1789.5s)]
*  The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1794.1000000000001s)]
*  has one of the most important collections [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1796.3s)]
*  of Cambodian antiquities in the world, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1798.28s)]
*  but many of the finest pieces on display here [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1801.5s)]
*  in the Southeast Asian art wing are stolen, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1803.8999999999999s)]
*  like this one and this one, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1807.0s)]
*  this as well. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1809.4399999999998s)]
*  All passed through the hands of Douglas Latchford. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1810.98s)]
*  Latchford sold this one to the Met in the early 1990s. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1814.1799999999998s)]
*  This one he donated. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1817.62s)]
*  Do you think people visiting the Met [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1819.28s)]
*  know that these were looted? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1821.22s)]
*  I think most people walk through the Met, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1822.8799999999999s)]
*  they have no idea those are blood antiquities. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1824.36s)]
*  They have no idea what the history is behind those pieces. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1826.76s)]
*  They don't know the temples they came from, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1829.82s)]
*  they don't know the people who were killed to get them here. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1832.46s)]
*  The dirt has been brushed off. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1834.8999999999999s)]
*  There's a little note that says where it came from. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1837.54s)]
*  Should people believe what's on that little note? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1840.5s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1842.3s)]
*  Last year, we went with Brad Gordon [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1845.1s)]
*  to see where in Cambodia the Met [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1846.8999999999999s)]
*  and other museums collections really did come from. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=1849.28s)]

*  They wanted to build up their collection [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2115.04s)]
*  and nobody was really asking questions where it came from. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2116.76s)]
*  For people, many people in the art world, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2119.68s)]
*  there was a sense of protecting great objects [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2124.12s)]

*  Under pressure 10 years ago, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2132.0s)]
*  the Met did return two statues called kneeling attendants, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2133.54s)]

*  that Douglas Latchford had brought to this museum? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2145.6s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that question. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2147.64s)]
*  I can only pick up the story several years later [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2149.84s)]
*  when Douglas Latchford was indicted in 2019 [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2152.56s)]
*  when we immediately and proactively [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2156.12s)]
*  went to the U.S. Attorney's Office [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2158.72s)]
*  and offered our full cooperation. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2160.64s)]
*  Well, I can pick up the story actually in 2013 [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2162.64s)]
*  because a spokesman for the Met said that no special effort [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2165.12s)]
*  was going to be made to check the provenances [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2168.6s)]
*  of any other Douglas Latchford-donated work. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2170.6s)]
*  Why wouldn't the Met want to look into everything else [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2174.4s)]
*  that Douglas Latchford had brought to this museum? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2178.04s)]
*  I can't speculate about why that didn't happen. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2180.64s)]
*  But no one investigated all the other items [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2183.36s)]
*  that Douglas Latchford gave? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2185.4s)]
*  Not to my knowledge. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2188.04s)]
*  The Met is not the only major museum [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2190.64s)]
*  with looted Cambodian artifacts, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2192.88s)]
*  but its collection is one of the largest in the world. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2194.96s)]
*  Last year, the museum announced it would create a research team [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2197.92s)]
*  to examine the provenance or acquisition history [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2201.2000000000003s)]
*  of all its collections. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2204.44s)]
*  It's taken 10 years since Douglas Latchford was shown [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2206.04s)]
*  to have given stolen property to the Met. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2210.04s)]
*  For the Met to set up this provenance team, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2214.92s)]
*  why has it taken 10 years? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2220.4s)]
*  It was a slow process. I'll grant you that. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2222.12s)]
*  It was a slow process, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2225.08s)]
*  but I think that the fact that we are fully engaged now, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2226.88s)]
*  fully cooperative now, is our only answer to this, really. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2231.44s)]
*  It's a moment of reckoning, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2235.32s)]
*  and we're ready to do what it takes now [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2236.52s)]
*  to right whatever the wrong is. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2239.0s)]
*  Four years ago, when Douglas Latchford was indicted [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2241.04s)]
*  by prosecutors, did you set up a team [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2243.88s)]
*  to check the provenance of every Latchford work? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2246.6s)]
*  We started, absolutely, we started to dig in [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2248.84s)]
*  right then and there. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2251.8s)]
*  It's not easy. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2253.4s)]
*  The fact that we don't have much information [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2255.0s)]
*  has to do with the fact that it's very hard to find the information. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2257.6s)]
*  There's enough information for federal prosecutors [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2260.48s)]
*  to charge Douglas Latchford with stealing and looting [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2262.48s)]
*  and trafficking and smuggled items. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2265.96s)]
*  How much more evidence do you need? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2268.44s)]
*  You haven't returned any Douglas Latchford-related items [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2271.6400000000003s)]
*  since he's been indicted, and that was four years ago. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2275.4s)]
*  We are on the verge of returning a number of them. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2277.1600000000003s)]
*  All of them? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2280.6800000000003s)]
*  That I can't say. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2282.64s)]
*  That interview took place in September. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2285.08s)]
*  Two days before we went to air, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2287.3999999999996s)]
*  prosecutors announced the Met would return 13 antiquities [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2289.52s)]
*  that came through Douglas Latchford. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2293.3199999999997s)]
*  But the Met is not returning this statue, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2295.56s)]
*  which was specifically cited in the indictment of Latchford, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2298.0s)]
*  or this one, which Latchford sold to the Met in 1992. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2301.2799999999997s)]
*  Cambodia's Culture Minister called the Met's announcement a first step [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2305.3199999999997s)]
*  and says she looks forward to the return of many more of our treasures. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2309.2s)]
*  Shouldn't museums have thought twice about buying things [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2313.68s)]
*  that were coming out of Cambodia during the genocide [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2317.16s)]
*  and civil war and decades of strife? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2320.2s)]
*  And this question that you raise [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2323.44s)]
*  is really the crux of what we're wrestling with. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2325.6s)]
*  You acquired pieces from a known smuggler [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2329.2s)]
*  who used a team of looters [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2333.04s)]
*  that the government has interviewed and taken statements from. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2337.08s)]
*  They have emails which refute the information [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2340.84s)]
*  in your own provenance at the museum. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2344.2799999999997s)]
*  You have items in the museum which were named in the indictment [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2346.56s)]
*  of Latchford that are still there. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2350.56s)]
*  And so these pieces should go back. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2352.56s)]
*  There's no question. That's the right thing to do. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2355.8s)]
*  This past September, the Lindemann family, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2358.8s)]
*  whose collection was showcased in Architectural Digest, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2360.96s)]
*  struck a deal with federal authorities. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2364.0s)]
*  Voluntarily agreeing to return 33 stolen treasures. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2366.48s)]
*  In a statement to the New York Times, the Lindemanns said, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2371.12s)]
*  Having purchased these items from dealers that we assumed were reputable, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2374.12s)]
*  we were saddened to learn how they made their way to the market in the United States. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2377.88s)]
*  Why did the Lindemanns agree to return their collection to Cambodia? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2382.6s)]
*  The pieces were dirty. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2385.8s)]
*  I think they finally came around to the fact that Latchford was dirty. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2387.56s)]
*  Their collection was all looted pieces. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2392.12s)]
*  It was obvious. And so they decided to surrender them. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2394.7599999999998s)]
*  We got a peek at what was the Lindemann collection [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2398.04s)]
*  shortly after the deal was done. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2401.3999999999996s)]
*  It was sitting in a warehouse in upstate New York, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2403.3999999999996s)]
*  a nation's living gods and ancestors waiting for a ride home. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2406.3999999999996s)]
*  This is like a whole wing of a museum. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2411.3999999999996s)]
*  A wing of a museum that only the Lindemanns and their friends had access to. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2413.3999999999996s)]
*  If the Lindemanns hadn't published these in Architectural Digest back in 2008, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2418.68s)]
*  I think there's a good chance we maybe never would have found it. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2424.64s)]
*  We always say the gods want to come home. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2428.0s)]
*  We feel like the gods have spoken today. They want to come home. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2430.0s)]
*  As one of the biggest crates was being opened, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2435.3599999999997s)]
*  waiting eagerly was Moe Kung Tang and Tida Long, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2437.8399999999997s)]
*  two members of Brad Gordon's investigative team. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2441.68s)]
*  This would be their first look at the mythical army commander taken from Kho Khe. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2444.8799999999997s)]
*  They were likely the first Cambodians to set eyes on it [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2449.8399999999997s)]
*  since Douglas Latchford stole it more than 50 years ago. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2453.2s)]
*  He's here. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2456.8799999999997s)]
*  There's a look in his eyes and on his face. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2458.3999999999996s)]
*  It's much bigger than I expected it to be. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2460.72s)]
*  It's presence is extraordinary. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2463.6s)]
*  I did not expect to feel this way. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2465.4399999999996s)]
*  Even the commander seemed to be smiling. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2468.72s)]
*  Then it was time to see the rarest piece in the Lindemann's collection. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2473.2s)]
*  The Cambodian team knelt in reverence as the Hindu god Vishnu was uncrated. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2477.52s)]
*  Despite all the fuss, he appeared unperturbed, reclining in a cosmic slumber. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2483.2s)]
*  When this statue arrives in Cambodia, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2490.08s)]
*  it will be welcomed as one of the most important ever returned. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2492.48s)]
*  Two Cambodian artifacts donated by the Lindemann family to the Met are still on display. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2498.8799999999997s)]
*  This month, the Cambodian government submitted a list of 49 antiquities held by the Met [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2504.72s)]
*  they claim are stolen and want back. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2509.8399999999997s)]
*  So when you look out there and you see all that green, what do you think? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2513.2s)]
*  I see money leaving America. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2530.8799999999997s)]
*  Pure insanity. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2532.8799999999997s)]
*  You're noticing miss and disinformation on your own social media. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2534.3199999999997s)]
*  This is the world we're taking in and we can make impacts and try to improve it. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2538.0s)]
*  Is this a battle of rich versus poor? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2543.2s)]
*  In part it is. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2547.68s)]
*  Black versus white? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2548.3999999999996s)]
*  In part it is. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2549.3599999999997s)]
*  If you're not willing to protect a place like this, then what are you willing to protect? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2551.9199999999996s)]
*  Go for me, go for three, one, two, three, go! [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2562.3199999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2564.3999999999996s)]
*  I want a strong America. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2565.4399999999996s)]
*  I want a proud America. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWPslK6tvyk&t=2567.3599999999997s)]
