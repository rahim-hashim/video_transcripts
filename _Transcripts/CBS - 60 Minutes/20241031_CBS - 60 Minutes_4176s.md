**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U)
*  The White House is a state where former President Trump and Vice President Harris are spending [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=0.0s)]
*  the most time and money, a combined $436 million, between them and their allies. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=23.12s)]
*  It's also where the results could take days to count due to a state law that prevents [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=29.96s)]
*  mail-in ballots from being processed early. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=34.36s)]
*  The anticipated lag, which dragged out Pennsylvania's count in 2020, now has election officials [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=37.52s)]
*  bracing for a repeat of conspiracy theories and violence. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=43.32s)]
*  At the helm, lifelong Republican Al Schmidt. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  He stood up to former President Trump and refused to join attempts to overturn his loss [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=51.18s)]
*  four years ago. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=55.88s)]
*  As Secretary of State, Schmidt is doing everything he can between now and Election Day to assure [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=57.56s)]
*  residents their votes will count and to take on the lies Trump continues to spread about [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=63.24s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=68.36s)]
*  What's the reality? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=70.92s)]
*  Voter fraud is widespread? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=72.08s)]
*  Voter fraud never happens. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=74.72s)]
*  There is no evidence whatsoever that voter fraud takes place in any way that is widespread [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=76.76s)]
*  at all. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=83.72s)]
*  If a non-citizen tried to cast a ballot, would you be able to catch it? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=84.72s)]
*  That's just not something that happens because when it gets identified, there are severe [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=89.92s)]
*  consequences whether it's prosecution and or deportation from the country. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=94.48s)]
*  We met Secretary of State Al Schmidt last month in the state capitol in Harrisburg. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=100.84s)]
*  We have to win Pennsylvania. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  The night before, former President Trump held a rally just a few hours away where he stoked [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=108.4s)]
*  fears about voting in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=113.72000000000001s)]
*  Now we have this stupid stuff where you can vote 45 days early. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=116.56s)]
*  I wonder what the hell happens during that 45. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  Let's move the, see these votes who got about a million votes in there, let's move them. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  Have you heard what the former president said last night at his rally here in Pennsylvania? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=127.92s)]
*  No. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=132.28s)]
*  He seems to be saying that there is cheating going on with mail-in ballots here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=133.28s)]
*  There is not. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=138.5s)]
*  Voters in Pennsylvania have never been more safe and secure with a voter verified paper [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=139.96s)]
*  ballot record of every vote that's cast, whether you vote in person on election day or you [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=145.6s)]
*  vote by mail. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=151.06s)]
*  Schmidt once had his own doubts about election security. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=152.28s)]
*  Before becoming Secretary of State, he spent a decade on Philadelphia's board of elections [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=156.12s)]
*  where he investigated hundreds of claims of voter fraud and changed his mind. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  Whenever it has occurred, however rarely, it's to affect some very down ticket race [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=166.92s)]
*  that is decided by a handful of votes. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=173.76s)]
*  It's not to decide who the president of the United States is or who the governor is or [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=177.34s)]
*  who a senator is or anything else like that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=181.2s)]
*  As Secretary of State, Schmidt is visiting each of Pennsylvania's 67 counties. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  Are you registered to vote in Pennsylvania? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=189.6s)]
*  Your voice matters. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=192.16s)]
*  Roadshow, part public relations tour, spreading the gospel of election security. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=193.72s)]
*  Election day is November 5th. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  You can vote by mail in advance. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=201.04s)]
*  Including a stop at a fair in deep red Columbia County. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=203.12s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=206.12s)]
*  He spent more than 35 minutes trying to convince these local Republicans that they can trust [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=207.64s)]
*  the voting system. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=212.8s)]
*  It's like dead people voting in Philadelphia. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=213.8s)]
*  You have a public record of when somebody died. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=217.32s)]
*  You have a public record of when they cast their vote. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=219.32s)]
*  They have found cases where quote, dead people have voted. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  The only cases that I've encountered are when a voter has cast their ballot by mail and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=225.72s)]
*  then passed away in between mailing in their vote and their vote being counted. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=232.0s)]
*  And you can see that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=237.2s)]
*  You know, former President Trump's got the rallies and he's got the microphone and he's [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=238.2s)]
*  got the audiences and he can spread his message to thousands if not millions of people. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=243.5s)]
*  And you're here at the county fair and you've got a stand and you're doing it one to three [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=249.64s)]
*  voters at a time. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=254.72s)]
*  Yes, you're one at one and a timing it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=256.12s)]
*  You kind of can't compete. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=258.64s)]
*  But it's also important to have that one on one contact to go to a county fair to engage [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=260.36s)]
*  with people to answer their questions. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=267.26s)]
*  I love you Philly. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=269.76s)]
*  Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro told us that choosing Al Schmidt, a lifelong Republican [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=272.56s)]
*  as his first cabinet pick last year, was intended to send a clear message. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=278.3s)]
*  Of all the cabinet appointments that you could have made first, why was it Al Schmidt? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=283.3s)]
*  I made a commitment during my campaign that I was going to appoint a pro-democracy secretary [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=289.9s)]
*  of state. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=296.74s)]
*  What were your marching orders to him? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=297.74s)]
*  Do your job. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=299.41999999999996s)]
*  Make it so legal, eligible voters have access to the ballot box and that we again have a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=300.74s)]
*  free and fair, safe and secure election. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=306.78s)]
*  When you think about secretaries of state, the role, you tend to think that it, respectfully, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=309.53999999999996s)]
*  is a boring job, a mundane job, an administrative job. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=316.53999999999996s)]
*  How's that working out for you? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=322.38s)]
*  It is. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=324.34s)]
*  I mean, elections should be not something to dread. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=325.34s)]
*  They should be something to celebrate. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=329.46s)]
*  And voters should feel confident that if they cast their vote, whether it's by mail or in [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=331.41999999999996s)]
*  person on election day, that their vote is going to be counted. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=336.06s)]
*  So in 2020, it took four days to call the election in Pennsylvania. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=339.54s)]
*  What took so long? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=344.5s)]
*  When you have half of your voters vote by mail, like we did in 2020, counting those [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=345.5s)]
*  votes takes time. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=352.18s)]
*  We saw for ourselves at a ballot intake center in Chester County outside Philadelphia. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=355.98s)]
*  So this is the actual envelope in these where the ballots are returned in. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=361.46s)]
*  And this is a sample? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=364.58s)]
*  Correct. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=366.09999999999997s)]
*  Elections Administrator Karen Barsoom showed us how each ballot arrives inside two different [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=367.09999999999997s)]
*  envelopes. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=372.03999999999996s)]
*  Processing them is a tedious task, which under Pennsylvania law cannot start until 7 a.m. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  on election day. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=380.8s)]
*  So when we do open it, there is another envelope. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=382.14s)]
*  So hypothetically speaking, if we have 100,000 mail-in ballots, we have to deal with double [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=385.14s)]
*  the amount of envelopes, which is a long process. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=390.46s)]
*  And then the ballots comes out. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=394.42s)]
*  And you can't count it folded like that? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=395.94s)]
*  Correct. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=398.34000000000003s)]
*  We will need to have a whole different team, unfold them, back fold them to get the creases [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=399.34000000000003s)]
*  out as good as we can. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=405.02000000000004s)]
*  How long does it take to process each ballot? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=406.82s)]
*  Several minutes. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=409.66s)]
*  It's not, it's not like done in a sec. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=410.66s)]
*  That window of time between the polls closing and races being called, I think has shown [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=413.42s)]
*  to be a real vulnerability where people seeking to undermine confidence in those results if [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=419.53999999999996s)]
*  they're going to lose have really exploited. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  Those four days allowed the big lie to take off. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's when you start hearing about truckloads of ballots. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=436.96s)]
*  And that's when you start hearing about, you know, zombie voters. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=440.34s)]
*  And that's when all this other stuff really starts pouring in. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=443.67999999999995s)]
*  There have been widespread calls to bring Pennsylvania in line with the majority of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=448.88s)]
*  other states where election workers get a head start on opening envelopes and flattening [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=452.64s)]
*  ballots ahead of election day. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=457.84s)]
*  Why hasn't that changed? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=460.21999999999997s)]
*  You've had four years, Pennsylvania. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  Pennsylvania is unique in that we have a divided legislature. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=463.88s)]
*  We have a democratic house and a republican Senate. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=466.2s)]

*  Be patient with Pennsylvania. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=478.28s)]
*  The message is please be patient. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=480.14s)]
*  Our counties are working night and day to count their voters' votes. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=483.02s)]
*  They're doing so as quickly as they can and with integrity. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=487.84s)]
*  Our job is to make sure we are constantly just providing the truth to voters to be a [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=492.76s)]
*  For Secretary Schmidt, getting out the message can mean late nights answering questions about [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=497.44s)]
*  the electoral process in granular detail. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=502.84s)]
*  It takes time to count millions of votes. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=506.16s)]
*  As we saw at this law school in Harrisburg. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=508.52000000000004s)]
*  We're much better prepared today four years later than we were. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=511.96000000000004s)]

*  The former president has a refrain at his rallies. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=520.24s)]
*  He says Democrats rigged the election in 2020 and he's not going to let them get away with [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=523.6800000000001s)]

*  Evidence. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=530.44s)]
*  Bring it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=531.44s)]
*  Any US attorney, any district attorney, bring the evidence and show them. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=533.84s)]
*  Not what you want. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=538.76s)]
*  You've got to convince a prosecutor in a court. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=540.96s)]
*  You've got polls that show some 34% of Americans, nearly 70% of Republicans who still to this [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=543.72s)]
*  day believe that Joe Biden didn't win the 2020 election. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=549.96s)]
*  But I can't change that because they believe it because they've heard it so many times. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=553.84s)]
*  You've said there's a huge amount of people in the middle that can be influenced by the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=558.48s)]
*  extremes. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=562.76s)]
*  Is that who you're trying to educate? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=563.76s)]
*  Yes, the extremes were not going to change, but right here and in a close election, that's [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=565.88s)]
*  very important. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=571.96s)]
*  We won Pennsylvania twice. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=573.18s)]
*  We won it twice. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=575.0s)]
*  We did much better the second time than we did the first time. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=577.0s)]

*  Donald Trump won in 2016 by about 44,000 votes and Donald Trump lost in 2020 by about 80,000 [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=585.88s)]
*  votes. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=594.08s)]

*  Republican and Democrat alike, is not the answer. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=608.64s)]
*  Before President Trump is refusing to commit to accepting the results if he loses, if he [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=612.76s)]
*  does refuse, what happens here in Pennsylvania? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=620.28s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=623.68s)]
*  I think it can look, unfortunately, like what it looked like in 2020 with violence in our [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=624.68s)]
*  communities, with threats to public officials, good public officials like Al Schmidt and [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=630.4s)]
*  the Republican and Democratic clerks of elections. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=635.56s)]

*  Am I concerned about that? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=639.76s)]
*  Of course I am. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=641.28s)]
*  In 2020, as the presidential election hung in the balance, all eyes were on the Pennsylvania [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=642.28s)]

*  While inside, Al Schmidt oversaw the counting of a record 375,000 mail-in ballots, most [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=657.16s)]
*  of them from Democratic voters. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=664.04s)]
*  We're winning Pennsylvania by a tremendous amount of votes. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=666.3199999999999s)]
*  Years after the polls closed, then-President Trump demanded the counting stop. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=670.92s)]
*  We don't want them to find any ballots at 4 o'clock in the morning and add them to the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=676.12s)]
*  list, OK? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=681.4s)]
*  We were working day and night. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=682.4s)]
*  There was one television that was working, and I happened to be passing it when I heard [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=685.52s)]
*  that speech. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=691.0799999999999s)]
*  So immediately brought together our communications team to begin, through social media platforms, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=692.4s)]
*  assuring the rest of the world, whose eyes were on Pennsylvania, that our vote counting [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=699.84s)]
*  was going to continue. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=705.44s)]
*  But at that point, you've got the president of the United States saying, stop the count. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=706.44s)]
*  Did you ever feel like you had to stop the count? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=711.72s)]
*  No, not for a second. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=714.52s)]
*  After four days, the race in Pennsylvania was finally called for Joe Biden, and with [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=716.9200000000001s)]
*  that, he won the White House. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=721.76s)]
*  Former President Trump went after Al Schmidt by name on Twitter, and violent threats from [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=724.52s)]
*  Trump supporters followed. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=729.52s)]
*  Do you remember the first threat that made you go, I've got to take this one seriously? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=731.88s)]
*  There were threats early on that were pretty generic in nature, but as days went on, they [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=738.4399999999999s)]
*  became a lot more specific, providing my address, graphic descriptions of what they would do [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=746.8s)]
*  They used a picture of your house at one point, I understand. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=759.64s)]
*  Listed your children's names repeatedly. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=764.4399999999999s)]
*  You had to move your family out of your house for safety? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=768.0s)]
*  Yes, they had to relocate for a period, and we had security around the clock for many [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=771.36s)]
*  months. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=779.24s)]
*  Given all the threats that you faced personally, I've got to ask why you would agree to take [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=780.24s)]
*  this job. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=786.28s)]
*  Well, everything is on the line. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=787.48s)]
*  Our entire system of government, our country as it was founded, is on the line. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=790.4s)]
*  With Donald Trump pulling out of his 60 Minutes interview tonight, we'll turn to a different [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=804.9599999999999s)]
*  Republican who is paying the price for Trump's claims of a stolen 2020 election. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=810.1999999999999s)]
*  Stephen Richer helps administer voting in Maricopa County, Arizona. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=816.92s)]
*  That's Phoenix and home to 60% of Arizona voters. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=822.1999999999999s)]
*  Maricopa is often decisive in a state which swings either way. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=826.64s)]
*  Trump claimed Maricopa County was stolen in 2020. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=832.16s)]
*  Republican Stephen Richer was determined to find the truth, to restore belief in the ballot. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=836.28s)]
*  He discovered that truth wasn't what many wanted to hear. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=843.04s)]
*  I've become much more cynical about politics. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=848.76s)]
*  There are a lot of people who have no lines in the sand, a lot of politicians, a lot of [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=852.16s)]
*  politicians for whom it's like oxygen, that if you told them they weren't going to be [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=856.36s)]
*  re-elected it would be like unplugging them from oxygen. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=860.5999999999999s)]
*  So whichever way the winds are blowing, even if it's highly immoral, they're on for the ride. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=863.68s)]
*  What are your fears for this coming election day? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=869.24s)]
*  We'll be doing this again for another four years. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=872.44s)]
*  Nearly four years ago, Republican attorney Stephen Richer was the voter's choice for [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=875.8s)]
*  Maricopa County Recorder, the office that records voter registration and handles ballots by mail. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=881.96s)]
*  Richer took office after the 2020 vote when his own party was up in arms over allegations of fraud. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=889.96s)]
*  It was Richer's first elected office and he knew what to do. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=898.04s)]
*  They just need answers. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=902.64s)]
*  It's not that complicated of an issue. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=905.04s)]
*  It's just people are uncertain. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=907.12s)]
*  They expected Donald Trump to win. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=908.8s)]
*  I expected Donald Trump to win in Maricopa County. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=910.56s)]
*  He didn't win. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=913.28s)]
*  They have questions. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=914.8s)]
*  As soon as we give them logical factual answers, all will be well. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=915.96s)]
*  And that's not what happened. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=920.88s)]
*  That is not what happened. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=921.88s)]
*  The logical factual answers came after multiple investigations. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=923.8s)]
*  A hand recount of Maricopa County's 2.1 million paper ballots confirmed Joe Biden won. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=929.12s)]
*  Statewide, prosecutions for illegal voting involved a total of 19 ballots. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=938.0799999999999s)]
*  In Maricopa, 50 ballots had been counted twice for a typical reason. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=946.0s)]
*  Somebody made a mistake. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=951.76s)]
*  A human being made a mistake. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=952.76s)]
*  There were 2.1 million ballots cast in the 2020 election. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=954.48s)]
*  These 50 shouldn't have been tabulated. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=957.68s)]
*  By no means were the 50 all for one candidate or another. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=959.36s)]
*  So it had a negligible impact on the actual contest. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=962.3199999999999s)]
*  Negligible too because Trump lost Maricopa County by 45,109 votes. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=966.68s)]
*  What evidence of widespread fraud was found in Maricopa County in 2020? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=973.88s)]
*  Oh, none. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=977.84s)]
*  I would say Maricopa County's 2020 election is the most scrutinized election in human history. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=978.88s)]
*  When you began to tell your fellow Republicans in Maricopa County that the election was fair [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=986.48s)]
*  and there was no fraud that would change the outcome, how did they react to you? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=993.56s)]
*  Not well. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=998.4s)]
*  No, not well at all. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1000.2s)]
*  They included Trump, who said, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1002.88s)]
*  the entire database of Maricopa County in Arizona has been deleted. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1005.3599999999999s)]
*  He called it an unbelievable election crime. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1011.16s)]
*  It was a Saturday afternoon and I was in the office looking at the very thing that he was saying we had deleted. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1015.12s)]
*  And so just sort of the like the ludicrous nature of it just is offensive. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1022.0799999999999s)]

*  I said something like, this is unhinged. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1032.52s)]
*  I'm looking at the voter registration database right now. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1037.08s)]
*  These lies have to stop. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1041.04s)]
*  This is as disprovable as saying two plus two equals five. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1042.44s)]
*  And the reaction was what? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1046.56s)]
*  The reaction was significant. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1048.16s)]
*  Three violent threats to Stephen Richard have been prosecuted. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1050.2s)]
*  One man got three and a half years. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1055.08s)]
*  The others are awaiting trial. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1057.44s)]
*  What we see here is your public statement saying that this was not connected to the Internet. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1060.1599999999999s)]
*  Undaunted, Richard explained the facts. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1064.56s)]
*  Here in 2021, he was heckled and followed to his car. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1068.28s)]
*  People were banging on my windshield as I got into the car. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1074.32s)]

*  I do not believe the 2014 election was stolen. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1092.24s)]
*  So why do so many people remain passionately unconvinced? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1100.04s)]
*  I think it has become the tattoo. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1105.0s)]

*  You believe the election was stolen? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1115.32s)]
*  I do. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1117.36s)]
*  Shelby Bush started a political action committee which investigates what she calls widespread [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1118.24s)]
*  fraud in Maricopa County, fraud no credible investigation has found. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1125.04s)]
*  She's taken in nearly a million dollars in donations for the work of her PAC. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1131.04s)]
*  And the Arizona Republican Party awarded her the leadership of its delegation at last summer's [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1137.32s)]
*  national convention. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1144.44s)]

*  That is for sure. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1170.28s)]
*  What do you believe happened in the Maricopa vote in 2020? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1171.56s)]
*  I believe that fraudulent votes were put into the system. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1176.12s)]
*  I also believe that a lot of state statutes and regulations and policies were broke, which [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1179.6799999999998s)]
*  makes the election questionable at best. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1186.2s)]

*  When it comes to elections. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1204.16s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1205.16s)]
*  In a recent case, a judge disqualified you from testifying in the case because he said [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1206.72s)]
*  you were, quote, obviously unqualified, not even in the ballpark. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1212.52s)]
*  That's one judge's opinion, who is a radical leftist, who is legislating from the bench, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1219.08s)]

*  with these conspiracy theories that no one has been able to validate? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1236.82s)]
*  Again, I'm going to disagree with you, sir, respectfully. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1241.8400000000001s)]
*  It has been validated. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1245.24s)]
*  And because the election... [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1247.04s)]

*  Give me a court case. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1251.04s)]
*  Give me something. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1252.56s)]
*  I don't need a government official with a vested interest in disproving information [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1254.0s)]
*  to tell me whether what I have is valid. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1259.92s)]
*  It's up to each individual citizen as a member of this society to review the evidence, to [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1262.68s)]
*  think for themselves and make those decisions. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1268.32s)]

*  I say it's valid because I say it is. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1272.56s)]

*  And all of that told you what? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1330.08s)]

*  But the chilling one that you didn't play is one of the guys said, we know the restaurants [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1511.4s)]
*  that you are in and we know where your kids go to school. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1518.68s)]
*  Menace grew in the shadows and emerged on the stage. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1525.16s)]
*  I hear the word unity and I get sick to my stomach because there is a lot of earthly, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1530.52s)]
*  fake and vile unity talk going around in our state. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1538.3600000000001s)]
*  This is Shelby Bush, the Maricopa County Republican Party vice chair, talking about fellow Republican [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1545.64s)]
*  Stephen Richard this past March. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1552.76s)]
*  So what does unity mean to me? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1555.56s)]
*  Unity means unifying with those that share the core biblical Christian, Judeo principles [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1559.24s)]
*  that we share. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1568.92s)]
*  That's unity. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1571.56s)]
*  But if Stephen Richard walked in this room, I would lynch him. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1576.28s)]
*  I don't unify with people who don't believe in the principles we believe in and the American [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1584.88s)]
*  cause that founded this country. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1590.48s)]
*  When you heard Shelby Bush say that she would lynch you, you thought what? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1592.96s)]
*  Well, I first thought like, why is that word in your vocabulary? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1597.5200000000002s)]
*  Lynch is a weirdly historically loaded and oddly specific term. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1603.0800000000002s)]
*  Bush offered a modified definition of lynching. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1609.68s)]
*  I think many people are familiar with a political lynching. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1613.48s)]
*  It's referred to as destroying someone's career. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1618.8s)]
*  It was not ever meant physically in any way, shape or form. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1622.84s)]
*  Probably a poor choice of words. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1627.68s)]
*  You have seen the unrest in this county, the civil disorder in this county. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1629.64s)]
*  You're contributing to that. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1636.72s)]
*  What I am doing is I am shining a big bright light on the disdain and the arrogance of [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1639.08s)]
*  some of the elected officials. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1647.4399999999998s)]
*  They are elected to represent the interests of the people. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1649.76s)]
*  And until they are ready to step up and do that, then there will be unrest. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1652.76s)]
*  Is election denialism a swindle? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1657.24s)]
*  Oh, 100 percent so for some people. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1659.9199999999998s)]
*  It's a swindle emotionally for some. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1664.28s)]
*  It's a swindle politically for some. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1666.5s)]
*  It's a swindle economically for some. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1668.8s)]
*  This past July, Stephen Richer ran in the primary for re-election. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1671.48s)]
*  He lost to a fellow Republican who said Maricopa elections are a laughing stock. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1676.3799999999999s)]
*  Richer moves on after this election, leaving behind his enduring contribution. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1684.48s)]
*  The fortress defenses around the center where the votes are counted. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1691.48s)]
*  A wall to defend America from Americans. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1698.16s)]
*  I have seen some ugliness in the character of human beings. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1704.0s)]
*  It has given me great insight into horrific moments of human history. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1709.52s)]
*  I would look at some of these historical moments and say, like, well, that couldn't happen [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1714.0s)]
*  here. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1718.68s)]
*  But moments like these begin to give you insight on how stuff like that can build up, how the [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1720.0800000000002s)]
*  animal passions, how going along with the crowd, how the emotions of just being your [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1726.6399999999999s)]
*  side versus their side. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1732.76s)]
*  It's just to say that some of the same human impulses that I didn't understand, I now do [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1734.8799999999999s)]
*  understand. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1740.6s)]
*  You understand how things can go wrong. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1742.0s)]
*  I understand how a society of educated people can do something truly horrible. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1744.28s)]
*  It's the vote that holds America together. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1757.52s)]
*  Belief that with a ballot, voices are heard, disputes are addressed, and there's always [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1760.96s)]
*  another chance. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1765.96s)]
*  Countries without this belief tend to be in bondage or at war. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1767.96s)]
*  Election Day is coming, but across America, belief is under attack. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1773.04s)]
*  Politicians who say the 2020 election was stolen are running for governor in 19 states, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1778.8s)]
*  20 general in 10, and in 12 states, election deniers are running for secretary of state, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1785.12s)]
*  which would give them power over elections. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1792.24s)]
*  After two years of investigations and audits, no fraud or error has been found in any state [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1795.4399999999998s)]
*  that would change the 2020 outcome. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1802.56s)]
*  But in 2022, spreading doubt has been key to an endorsement from Donald Trump. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1805.48s)]
*  No state has been more deeply riven by this than Arizona, where a split in the GOP has [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1812.32s)]
*  Republicans on opposite sides of a Grand Canyon. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1819.2s)]
*  On one side of the Arizona chasm stands Rusty Bowers, a lifelong Republican and artist who [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1824.8s)]
*  became Arizona's Speaker of the House. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1831.28s)]
*  Bowers told us he was disappointed when Joe Biden won. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1834.92s)]
*  So when President Trump and Rudy Giuliani called after the election, he was listening. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1839.04s)]
*  First Rudy started and said, well, there's been a lot of fraud all across the country [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1845.6s)]
*  and in Arizona. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1850.68s)]
*  And then he listed off large numbers in categories that would be illegal, dead people, stolen [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1852.2s)]
*  ballots. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1861.1599999999999s)]
*  Bowers says Giuliani wanted him to hold a vote to revoke Biden's electors. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1862.52s)]
*  And I said, but Rudy, I want the proof. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1868.92s)]
*  You're going to give me the proof? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1871.84s)]
*  And he said, yes. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1873.72s)]
*  So Giuliani and co-counsel Jenna Ellis flew out to meet Bowers. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1875.6s)]
*  You left the meeting with Rudy Giuliani thinking what? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1880.96s)]
*  I wasn't happy. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1884.52s)]
*  I said, okay, time out. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1886.76s)]
*  Mr. Giuliani, you said you were going to bring me some proof, names, et cetera, of all of [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1889.8s)]
*  these people. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1895.4s)]
*  Did you bring me the proof? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1896.4s)]
*  You looked at Jenna Ellis and he said, do we have the proof? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1897.8000000000002s)]
*  And she said, yes, we do. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1900.92s)]
*  Do you have it with you? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1903.52s)]
*  No, no. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1905.0s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1906.88s)]
*  It might be back at the hotel room. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1907.96s)]
*  And I said, I asked you for the proof. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1910.1200000000001s)]
*  You said you'd bring it. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1911.6000000000001s)]
*  You're not bringing it. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1912.76s)]
*  You're asking me to break my oath and make up something to pull electors and replace [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1914.2s)]
*  electors, which has never been done in the history of the United States. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1922.0s)]
*  And I'm going to try that on my state. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1927.2s)]
*  Without Bowers, Giuliani found an ally willing to call the vote criminal, Arizona State Representative [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1930.0s)]
*  Mark Fincham. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1938.16s)]
*  It's exceedingly hard for me to place a label on what we've heard other than racketeering. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1939.64s)]
*  Good old-fashioned mobster racketeering. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1946.16s)]
*  Four weeks after Mr. Trump's defeat, Fincham held an unofficial hearing featuring Giuliani [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1949.92s)]
*  A conspiracy that was hatched by the crooked leaders of the Democratic Party. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1958.1200000000001s)]
*  A day of allegations without credible evidence ended with this. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1963.3200000000002s)]
*  When Satan wants to extinguish a light, he will stop at nothing. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1968.2s)]
*  So be on your guard, put on the full armor of God, and be prepared to fight. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1974.68s)]
*  Mark Fincham fought and now the 65-year-old former police officer is the Republican nominee [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1982.6s)]
*  for Arizona's Secretary of State, which would give him authority over elections. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1989.44s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, we know it and they know it. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=1995.1200000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump won. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2000.16s)]
*  But Mark Bernovich does not know it. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2004.64s)]
*  He's Arizona's Republican attorney general who's investigated for two years and has [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2007.8s)]
*  a word for claims of fraud. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2013.8s)]
*  Horse s**t. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2016.96s)]
*  And that's what it is. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2017.96s)]
*  Most of it's horse s**t and I've been trying to scrape it off my shoes for the last year. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2018.96s)]
*  Bernovich supported Trump, who called him with advice. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2024.1599999999999s)]
*  He goes, all you got to do is say the election is fraudulent and you will be a superstar. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2028.04s)]
*  You'll be the most popular guy in America. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2034.24s)]
*  And I told him, I said, Mr. President, I didn't become attorney general to be a star. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2036.48s)]
*  I brought my star with me and I don't need anybody, whether it's a former president or [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2041.08s)]
*  any other person, validating what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2046.36s)]
*  What he's doing is bringing indictments in every 2020 vote fraud case that he can back [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2050.72s)]
*  with evidence. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2056.48s)]
*  Altogether to date, from the general election, Arizona has indicted 12 defendants in cases [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2058.2s)]
*  involving a total of 12 ballots. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2065.94s)]
*  12 statewide. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2069.9s)]
*  Biden won Arizona by 10,000. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2072.98s)]
*  There is no one in this country that wanted to find evidence of fraud more than I did. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2076.78s)]
*  But I thought it was important to systematically go through and say, no, this is the facts, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2080.78s)]
*  this is the evidence, everyone's entitled to their own opinions. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2085.82s)]
*  But when you're an actual prosecutor, when you're the actual government, there's a higher [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2088.7000000000003s)]
*  obligation. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2092.58s)]
*  You can't afford to be sloppy. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2093.58s)]
*  In addition to Bernovich's investigations, in 2021, the Republican-led state Senate audited [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2095.38s)]
*  Phoenix's Maricopa County, home to 60 percent of the state vote. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2102.98s)]
*  The audit was done by a company that had never audited an election. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2108.7200000000003s)]
*  The audit's hand recount confirmed Joe Biden won. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2113.98s)]
*  But its report also raised questions about discrepancies it found. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2118.82s)]
*  Those questions were answered online in detail by Maricopa County. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2123.82s)]
*  Still, widespread fraud is Mark Fincham's charge. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2129.82s)]
*  When you steal something, that's not really a win. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2134.9s)]
*  That's a fraud. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2139.38s)]
*  That was in Washington the day before the attack on the Capitol, which Fincham describes [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2141.48s)]
*  this way. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2147.46s)]
*  His entire J6 crap was manufactured to create a narrative that there was an assault on the [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2148.58s)]
*  Capitol. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2157.7799999999997s)]
*  This fits into the Marxist ideology of how do you go to one party rule? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2158.7799999999997s)]
*  Today, Fincham is running neck and neck with his Democratic opponent, Adrian Fontes, who [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2165.58s)]
*  helped lead the 2020 election in Maricopa County. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2172.18s)]
*  We are far too divided away from each other based on lies and conspiracies. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2176.56s)]
*  And we as election administrators across Arizona have to do a better job showing folks that [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2181.72s)]
*  the system is quite good. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2185.6s)]
*  I'd like to see a world where it's easy to vote but hard to cheat. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2187.16s)]
*  We asked Fincham for credible proof of fraud. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2191.7599999999998s)]
*  He raised not evidence but those questions from the state Senate audit. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2195.44s)]
*  Next, Fincham told us about a mysterious post-election email which he featured in a rally. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2201.52s)]
*  We had a whistleblower who sent an email not just to the DOJ but to every single legislator [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2209.04s)]
*  saying there's 34, 35,000 fictitious voters and they've been in certain systems where [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2214.6400000000003s)]
*  you'll never find them. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2221.2400000000002s)]
*  Well we believe we found them. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2223.48s)]
*  In the email Fincham speaks of, a Brian Watson said Democrats added bogus votes electronically [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2227.12s)]
*  in Pima County. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2234.72s)]
*  The writer had no evidence, asked not to be contacted, and closed his email account. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2236.4s)]
*  Why would you give this any credence? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2243.18s)]
*  Again, it's an open question. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2246.0s)]
*  I want to know, was there a possibility that this happened? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2248.8399999999997s)]
*  Now we've now proven that it happened, Scott. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2252.64s)]
*  How so? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2255.2s)]
*  We've got two precincts that show over 100% of the people registered to vote in that precinct [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2256.2s)]
*  voted. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2261.2s)]
*  That is an undeniable fact. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2263.2799999999997s)]
*  But it is deniable by Pima County, which says no precinct had more votes than voters. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2265.68s)]
*  Another of Fincham's frequent points concerns a pair of indictments. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2273.16s)]
*  We have, for example, in Yuma County, ballot harvesting and votes. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2278.04s)]
*  We've got people who were indicted for the very thing that we're talking about right [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2282.96s)]
*  now who pled guilty. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2287.08s)]
*  And frankly, those votes altered the outcome of Yuma County. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2289.64s)]
*  Yuma County, we've actually had indictments and people that have pled guilty to ballot [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2295.0s)]
*  trafficking. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2298.96s)]
*  How many ballots were involved? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2299.96s)]
*  I don't know off the top of my head. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2300.96s)]
*  It's four. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2303.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2304.1s)]
*  Whether it's four or four thousand, doesn't matter. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2305.1s)]
*  It wasn't the presidential election, it was a primary. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2306.68s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2308.96s)]
*  It's a defect in the system. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2310.44s)]
*  A minuscule defect. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2312.4s)]
*  Two women in Yuma County pleaded guilty to collecting four ballots and dropping them [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2314.6400000000003s)]
*  in a ballot box. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2319.76s)]
*  It's against state law to deposit a ballot that isn't yours or your family's. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2321.6s)]
*  It's four ballots in a primary. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2327.56s)]
*  In that instance. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2329.6s)]
*  In that instance. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2331.36s)]
*  You have a bigger one? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2332.36s)]
*  Well, we've got information that's been turned over to the attorney general's office and [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2333.84s)]
*  you say that there was nothing there. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2337.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2339.2000000000003s)]
*  Then I'm going to have to live with that. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2340.64s)]
*  But do I know for a fact that there were other ballot trafficking operations around the country [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2342.2799999999997s)]
*  and some in Arizona? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2347.52s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2348.52s)]
*  Name one. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2349.52s)]
*  Yuma County, 25,000 ballots. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2351.52s)]
*  What happened? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2353.72s)]
*  Same fingerprints on those ballots for five individuals. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2355.7999999999997s)]
*  So where'd that go? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2359.8799999999997s)]
*  Where's that evidence? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2362.0s)]
*  I know it's been turned over to the attorney general's office. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2363.0s)]
*  I know that the FBI field office actually did the prints. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2366.44s)]
*  That's false, according to the FBI. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2370.64s)]
*  Yuma County told us that no one in law enforcement fingerprinted 25,000 ballots. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2374.08s)]
*  Fincham often says that evidence is with Attorney General Bernovich, implying that something [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2380.4s)]
*  big is coming. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2386.7200000000003s)]
*  In fact, he has a mountain of evidence that's sitting in his office. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2388.36s)]
*  But Bernovich told us his investigation is essentially over. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2391.78s)]
*  We as prosecutors deal in facts and evidence. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2396.78s)]
*  And I'm not like the clowns that throw stuff against the wall and see what sticks. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2399.7400000000002s)]
*  Clowns. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2403.26s)]
*  Clowns. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2404.26s)]
*  Did I say that? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2405.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2406.26s)]
*  I think that there were a lot of clowns out there that they saw what they wanted to see. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2407.26s)]
*  What is it? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2411.9s)]
*  Simon Garfunkel line that a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2412.9s)]
*  There was a lot of that going on. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2416.9s)]
*  What's going on in the top Arizona races where the Republican for governor is a denier? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2419.46s)]
*  We had a fraudulent election, a corrupt election, and we have an illegitimate president sitting [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2425.96s)]
*  in the White House. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2430.7400000000002s)]
*  It's like a giant grift in some ways. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2432.14s)]
*  A grift, a swindle is what you're saying. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2434.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2438.46s)]
*  All of these accusations, the case in Yuma, scaremongering, the Brian Watson email, scaremongering, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2439.7400000000002s)]
*  you called Arizona the epicenter of fraud. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2448.46s)]
*  It's scaremongering. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2453.18s)]
*  It's not the fraud that is breaking people's faith in our elections. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2455.86s)]
*  It's people like you. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2460.2s)]
*  So you say. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2463.34s)]
*  But when we look at the violations of state statute, this is the epicenter of the problem. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2466.02s)]
*  Nationwide, 190 election deniers are running for the U.S. House and 14 for the U.S. Senate, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2474.02s)]
*  according to the Brookings Institution. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2483.2200000000003s)]
*  Mark Bernovich lost his primary to a denier, and so did Rusty Bowers, which may come as [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2486.2200000000003s)]
*  a relief. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2494.38s)]
*  Don't come over. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2495.38s)]
*  Don't come over. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2496.82s)]
*  Last election, Trump supporters and conspiracy spinners laid siege to Bowers' home up to [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2498.54s)]
*  three times a week. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2504.7s)]
*  Rusty Bowers is a pedophile. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2506.3s)]
*  He had to fend them off, a man with a pistol, demonstrators in their own armored car. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2509.3s)]
*  And at the state capitol, on January 6, 2021, they came with rifles and a guillotine. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2517.18s)]

*  It's a large group of them that is doing the hijacking. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2538.06s)]
*  I just don't think it's a majority. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2541.82s)]
*  Its effectiveness as a party and its legitimacy in public discourse is grossly undermined [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2544.42s)]

*  Donald Trump began spreading unsubstantiated claims that an American company, Dominion [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2569.5s)]
*  Voting Systems, had rigged the election. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2574.46s)]

*  millions of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2581.42s)]

*  caused to his company and his employees. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2612.58s)]

*  Their lives have been upended and all because of lies. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2619.9s)]
*  It was a very clear calculation that they knew there were lies and they were repeating [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2624.44s)]
*  them and endorsing them. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2628.06s)]
*  It's important to you people admit what they said was wrong. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2629.66s)]
*  It's important to me. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2633.54s)]
*  It's important to all the people whose families have been impacted by this. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2634.7s)]

*  People have done this. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2653.54s)]

*  For John Poulos and his company, the trouble began five days after the election when Fox [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2657.66s)]
*  business host Maria Bartiromo brought up Dominion with attorney Sidney Powell. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2662.5s)]
*  Sidney, we talked about the Dominion software. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2667.1s)]
*  I know that there were voting irregularities. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2669.86s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2672.98s)]
*  That's to put it mildly, the computer glitches could not and should not have happened in [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2675.14s)]
*  at all. That is where the fraud took place, where they were flipping votes in the [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2681.1800000000003s)]
*  computer system or adding votes that did not exist. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2686.26s)]
*  Sidney Powell was never able to show fraud, but she was repeatedly invited back on Fox [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2690.06s)]
*  networks, as was the president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who also wove a false [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2695.06s)]
*  narrative about Smartmatic, an election technology company which is now suing Giuliani, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2700.74s)]
*  Fox News and others. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2706.2599999999998s)]
*  Smartmatic is a company that was formed by three Venezuelans who were very close to [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2707.82s)]
*  very close to the dictator Chavez of Venezuela. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2714.58s)]
*  And it was formed in order to fix elections. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2719.58s)]
*  That's the company that owns Dominion. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2723.34s)]
*  Does Smartmatic own Dominion? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2726.38s)]
*  No, we are. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2728.22s)]
*  We do have a relationship. We are competitors. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2729.82s)]
*  Were you associated with the late Hugo Chavez? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2732.74s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2735.14s)]
*  Do you use a Venezuelan company's software that's been used to steal election out of [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2736.14s)]
*  the countries? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2740.62s)]
*  Absolutely not. And I can cut all of this short. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2741.34s)]
*  We were founded in Toronto, which is where my family was from. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2745.42s)]
*  And there is nothing to do with Venezuela. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2749.7400000000002s)]
*  Can you flip votes in the computer system? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2752.18s)]
*  Can you add votes that did not exist? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2754.3s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2757.66s)]
*  President Trump first mentioned Dominion in a tweet November 12th and recorded this video [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2759.06s)]
*  a few weeks later, which was posted on Facebook. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2763.98s)]
*  We have a company that's very suspect. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2766.66s)]
*  Its name is Dominion. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2770.2999999999997s)]
*  With the turn of a dial or the change of a chip, you can press a button for Trump and [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2772.14s)]
*  the vote goes to Biden. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2779.94s)]
*  What kind of a system is this? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2781.46s)]
*  We have to go to paper. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2784.62s)]
*  Maybe it takes longer, but the only secure system is paper. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2786.8199999999997s)]
*  Why not just have paper ballots? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2792.2599999999998s)]
*  We do have paper ballots. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2794.42s)]
*  What the machines do is they count those paper ballots in a way that makes it very easy [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2796.1800000000003s)]
*  for people to verify after the fact through the means of audits and recounts. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2802.0600000000004s)]
*  Dominion makes two types of machines. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2806.5800000000004s)]
*  One is called a ballot marker. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2808.9s)]
*  It's a touchscreen device that a voter can use to mark their choices and then print the [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2810.7400000000002s)]
*  ballot. The second machine is a scanner that reads that paper ballot, counts the vote [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2815.5s)]
*  and immediately stores the ballot securely. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2821.1000000000004s)]
*  A voter takes a paper ballot. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2823.86s)]
*  They've made their marks, however they make their marks, depending on the jurisdiction. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2826.2200000000003s)]
*  As they deposited into the ballot box, it goes through a digital scanner and then drops [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2830.06s)]
*  into the ballot box. So how do you hack a paper ballot? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2834.26s)]
*  With our system, he showed us how it works. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2838.14s)]
*  This is the scanner that sits atop a locked and sealed ballot box. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2840.82s)]
*  This is how they cast their ballot, goes through a scanner. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2845.02s)]
*  And now we have an image of the ballot we just cast and we have the paper ballot that [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2848.1s)]
*  is used for recounts. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2853.58s)]
*  John Poulos says it was watching the presidential recounts in Florida in 2000 with those [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2855.7000000000003s)]
*  arguments over hanging chads that got him interested in improving how paper ballots [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2860.6600000000003s)]
*  were marked and counted. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2865.6600000000003s)]
*  He was an engineer working at a startup in Silicon Valley and began looking at ways to [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2867.6600000000003s)]
*  make it easier to recount paper ballots and to help people with disabilities vote without [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2872.42s)]
*  assistance. Our goal was to allow any voter to make their marks on a paper ballot. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2877.98s)]
*  In a very clear, unambiguous way, regardless of physical ability. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2883.5s)]
*  John Poulos is Canadian and founded Dominion in 2002. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2888.9s)]
*  He remains its chief executive, though it was acquired by an American investment group [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2893.38s)]
*  in 2018. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2898.02s)]
*  Dominion is based in Denver. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2899.78s)]
*  Do you ever think to yourself, I got into this to help paraplegics and blind people [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2902.1400000000003s)]
*  vote more easily and look what's happened? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2906.1800000000003s)]
*  I think about it all the time. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2909.78s)]
*  Dominion is one of three companies that make most of the voting systems in America. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2911.5s)]
*  In the 2020 presidential election, their machines were in 28 states, red states and [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2915.82s)]
*  blue. On election day in a precinct, are your machines hooked up to the Internet? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2921.02s)]
*  No, not by not by any stretch. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2925.34s)]
*  We go through a number of certifications, government certifications, and the first one [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2927.82s)]
*  is at a federal level. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2932.7400000000002s)]
*  So those standards mandate that election systems such as ours are designed to work in a [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2934.1s)]
*  closed system, air gapped, no Internet. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2939.86s)]
*  In all the major swing states of 2020, there are paper ballots backing up. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2943.46s)]
*  Not only are there paper ballots that make up the official record, those paper ballots [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2948.34s)]
*  have been hand counted and audited over a thousand times on just the 2020 election. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2953.1400000000003s)]
*  Recounts and audits in the swing states of Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2959.46s)]
*  Nevada all confirmed Dominion's results. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2964.58s)]
*  More than 60 lawsuits around the country challenging the election by Trump or his [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2967.6200000000003s)]
*  supporters were ultimately withdrawn or failed. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2971.78s)]
*  In Georgia, there have been three recounts, two electronic ones and one hand recount. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2975.3s)]
*  In front of cameras, bipartisan poll watchers and thousands of local residents across the [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2981.5s)]
*  state of Georgia and once again reaffirm the results. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2987.6600000000003s)]
*  That should have put an end to all of it. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2990.78s)]
*  But the lies persisted. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2993.86s)]
*  And so have incidents of harassment and threats against John Poulos and his employees. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=2996.6600000000003s)]
*  Every single person at Dominion is going to end up in an orange jumpsuit in handcuffs. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3002.38s)]
*  You whores, you cheating pigs. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3007.86s)]

*  This is something that continues to happen every single day for us. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3024.38s)]

*  Had something been said to her personally? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3045.58s)]
*  A very disgusting death threat in detail. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3048.66s)]
*  Received? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3052.2200000000003s)]
*  On her personal cell phone. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3053.06s)]
*  It's completely and utterly surreal. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3055.22s)]

*  when Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and others continued their attacks on Dominion machines and software. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3089.3799999999997s)]
*  It can set and run an algorithm that probably ran all over the country to take a certain percentage of votes [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3095.5s)]
*  from President Trump and flip them to President Biden. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3102.7s)]
*  Do you remember watching that? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3106.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I tweeted about it immediately afterwards. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3107.8599999999997s)]
*  I think I said something along the lines that that was the most insane and dangerous 45 minutes of TV in American history effectively. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3109.8599999999997s)]
*  How secure was the 2020 election? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3118.46s)]
*  Let me put it this way. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3121.2599999999998s)]
*  It was the most litigated. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3122.5s)]
*  It was the most scrutinized. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3124.5s)]
*  It was the most audited. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3126.2599999999998s)]
*  This election was put through the wringer from so many different directions. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3127.98s)]
*  And what I tend to like to say is, don't listen to me, listen to Bill Barr. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3132.06s)]
*  Bill Barr said it. He was then the attorney general of the United States. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3136.9399999999996s)]
*  This is what Bill Barr later said to the January 6 committee. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3140.8199999999997s)]
*  These claims on the Dominion voting machines and they were idiotic claims. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3144.2999999999997s)]
*  I saw absolutely zero basis for the allegations, but they were made in such a sensational way that they obviously were influencing a lot of people. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3149.54s)]
*  Dominion began alerting Fox News and other networks of the false allegations they were broadcasting November 12th, four days after Sidney Powell first discussed Dominion with Maria Bartiromo. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3159.9s)]
*  But Dominion says Fox News never retracted their reporting. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3171.02s)]
*  You gave them a lot of chances to correct their statements. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3175.06s)]
*  They still haven't corrected them. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3178.5s)]
*  To me, that's the most powerful part of the complaint. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3180.46s)]
*  Lee Levine is a First Amendment attorney who's litigated cases for 40 years on behalf of most media companies, including CBS and Fox. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3183.58s)]
*  He's retired now, but his old firm is currently representing CNN and me in a separate matter filed by attorneys who also represent Dominion in its cases against Fox News and others. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3192.9s)]
*  Take the Fox case, for example. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3204.1800000000003s)]
*  November 12th seems to me to be the key date in that case, because that's the day that Dominion started on a regular basis, sending information sheets to every producer on every show at Fox that was having Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani on, saying, here are the true facts. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3206.86s)]
*  Here are links supporting our assertions that these are the true facts. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3228.02s)]
*  And then these people continued to invite Giuliani and Powell on their shows. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3233.22s)]
*  Defamation cases are hard to prove, aren't they? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3240.4199999999996s)]
*  Yes, they are. The plaintiff has to prove what the law calls actual malice. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3242.8599999999997s)]
*  You need to show basically that the defendant published or broadcast a deliberate lie, a calculated falsehood. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3248.58s)]
*  They knew it was a lie when they broadcast it. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3255.66s)]
*  They knew it was a lie or they knew it was probably a lie. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3257.9399999999996s)]
*  How strong is Dominion's case against Fox and the others? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3261.14s)]
*  I think it is much stronger than most defamation cases that I have seen. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3264.94s)]
*  I might say it is the strongest. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3270.7s)]
*  How many defamation cases have you seen? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3273.42s)]
*  I have litigated myself hundreds, and I'm certainly aware of every significant defamation case in the last 40 years. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3275.5s)]
*  And this is the strongest one? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3284.5s)]
*  In my judgment. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3286.1s)]
*  In a statement to 60 Minutes, Fox said it's confident it will prevail, citing freedom of the press protections, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3287.94s)]
*  and stating it was reporting on a newsworthy allegation made by the then president and aired segments fact-checking the allegations against Dominion. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3294.3s)]
*  Dominion is suing Fox News and its parent corporation for $1.6 billion each. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3303.14s)]
*  And in its statement, Fox said that Dominion's financial demand is unsupported. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3308.82s)]
*  Efforts by Fox News and other defendants to have the lawsuits dismissed have been rejected by the courts. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3314.06s)]
*  Do you think that you can show not only that they lied, but they knew that they were lying? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3320.06s)]
*  I don't even think, I think that's the easiest part. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3327.1s)]
*  You, as a company, told them specifically, repeatedly. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3329.62s)]
*  We told them. We told them in real time. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3333.66s)]
*  Others told them. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3336.38s)]
*  Government officials told them. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3337.7400000000002s)]
*  Partisan government officials told them. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3339.38s)]
*  People inside the Trump administration told them. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3341.5s)]
*  Local election officials on both sides of the aisle told them. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3345.9s)]
*  This is not a matter of not knowing the truth. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3348.98s)]
*  They knew the truth. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3351.46s)]
*  The 2020 presidential election had record-setting turnout, with more than 145 million ballots cast. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3371.26s)]
*  While President-elect Joe Biden collected more of those votes, and news organizations have projected him as the winner, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3378.7000000000003s)]
*  President Trump has refused to concede. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3385.78s)]
*  He has called for recounts and filed lawsuits questioning the validity of many of those ballots, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3388.6200000000003s)]
*  mostly the ones cast by mail all over the country. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3394.1000000000004s)]
*  As COVID spiked again, vote-by-mail ballots flooded tabulation centers. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3397.46s)]
*  Other ballots jammed street-side drop boxes or were hand-delivered to registrars and city clerks. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3402.5s)]
*  What could have been chaos, instead became an exercise in democracy. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3408.7000000000003s)]
*  We saw that firsthand in five separate counties across the swing state of Pennsylvania, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3414.26s)]
*  with its crucial 20 electoral votes. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3419.5s)]
*  There, the election was a success. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3422.42s)]
*  We had some questions for the people responsible for counting the vote. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3424.9s)]
*  President Trump has said bad things happen in Philadelphia. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3429.9s)]
*  Are bad things happening in Philadelphia? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3434.86s)]
*  In the birthplace of our republic, counting votes is not a bad thing. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3437.5s)]
*  Counting votes cast on or before election day by eligible voters is not correct. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3444.1s)]
*  It is not corruption. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3453.34s)]
*  It is not cheating. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3456.38s)]
*  It is democracy. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3460.78s)]
*  Al Schmid is one of three commissioners who run elections in Philadelphia and the lone Republican. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3462.6200000000003s)]
*  There really should not be a disagreement, regardless of party affiliation, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3469.2200000000003s)]
*  when we're talking about counting votes cast on or before election day by eligible voters. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3473.54s)]
*  It's not a very controversial thing, or at least it shouldn't be. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3481.02s)]
*  But yet it is. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3483.86s)]
*  Unfortunately, yes. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3485.9s)]
*  And we've done in the past. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3487.7000000000003s)]
*  We first met Commissioner Schmid back in September. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3488.7000000000003s)]
*  With the country in the grip of the pandemic, Schmid was expecting a flood of mail-in ballots. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3492.1s)]
*  When you have half of your voters vote by mail. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3498.46s)]
*  And urging patience. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3502.06s)]
*  You will not know the outcome on election night. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3504.1s)]
*  He couldn't have been more right. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3507.26s)]
*  The flood became a deluge. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3509.38s)]
*  360,000 mail-in ballots poured in in Philadelphia. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3511.46s)]
*  That was more than all the mail-in votes in the state in 2016. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3515.98s)]
*  More than 90 percent were from Democrats. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3520.58s)]
*  As those ballots were counted in the convention center in Philadelphia this past week, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3523.82s)]
*  President Trump's initial lead in Pennsylvania slowly was chipped away. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3528.38s)]
*  On Wednesday, with hundreds of thousands of votes still to count, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3533.54s)]
*  President Trump tweeted he had won the state. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3537.5s)]
*  His campaign and party started filing lawsuits claiming voting irregularities and fraud, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3541.1s)]
*  especially in Philadelphia. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3547.2599999999998s)]
*  We are going to file a suit in Pennsylvania. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3549.3399999999997s)]
*  The president's son, Eric, and Rudy Giuliani rushed to Philadelphia to assert with great [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3551.8599999999997s)]
*  urgency, but no evidence that democracy itself was under attack. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3557.3799999999997s)]
*  This is absolute fraud. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3562.3399999999997s)]
*  We've seen it in Philadelphia before. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3563.62s)]
*  By the end of the week, with former Vice President Joe Biden inching ahead in the vote [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3565.7000000000003s)]

*  most aimed at disrupting the count. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3576.9s)]
*  Pennsylvania is living up to its reputation as a crucial battleground in presidential [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3580.86s)]
*  elections. In 2016, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton here by less than one percent of the [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3585.6600000000003s)]
*  vote. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3592.1800000000003s)]
*  Each ballot must be counted. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3592.82s)]
*  With a similar edge over President Trump, news organizations on Saturday projected [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3594.62s)]
*  former Vice President Joe Biden had won Pennsylvania and the presidency. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3599.7799999999997s)]
*  Spontaneous celebrations broke out in Philadelphia and across the country. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3606.34s)]
*  Still, the Trump campaign is going to court to challenge the validity of the vote in [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3612.38s)]
*  Pennsylvania and other battleground states. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3617.22s)]

*  The president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said he'll start filing lawsuits [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3622.2999999999997s)]
*  Monday. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3627.58s)]
*  I don't know if there's enough evidence to set aside the entire election. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3628.2599999999998s)]
*  Certainly not around the country, maybe in Pennsylvania. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3632.7s)]

*  From the inside looking out, it feels all very deranged. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3665.3799999999997s)]
*  Deranged. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3669.8199999999997s)]
*  At the end of the day, we are counting eligible votes cast by voters. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3670.62s)]
*  The controversy surrounding it is something I don't understand. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3676.66s)]
*  It's people making accusations that we wouldn't count those votes or people are adding [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3680.46s)]
*  fraudulent votes or just coming up with just all sorts of crazy stuff. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3686.2999999999997s)]
*  Accusations like you are cheating. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3692.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3695.18s)]
*  You are manipulating the vote. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3695.74s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3697.9s)]
*  Or calls to our offices reminding us that this is what the Second Amendment is for. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3698.5s)]
*  People like us. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3707.26s)]
*  You're getting calls like that? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3710.3s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3711.5800000000004s)]
*  That's a not so veiled death threat. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3712.94s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3715.7000000000003s)]
*  For counting votes in a democracy. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3716.5400000000004s)]
*  The election here had been running smoothly. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3721.5s)]
*  60 minutes dropped in on five pivotal counties. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3724.86s)]
*  Northampton in the Northeast voted twice for Barack Obama, then flipped to Donald Trump in 2016. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3728.3s)]
*  We saw long lines of voters there waiting patiently to cast ballots on election day. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3735.7400000000002s)]
*  In neighboring Luzerne County, we saw orderly vote counting under the watchful gaze of party [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3742.7400000000002s)]
*  poll watchers certified by the state. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3748.5800000000004s)]
*  It was the same in the affluent suburbs around Philadelphia. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3751.1800000000003s)]
*  You are allowed in there. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3754.46s)]
*  And Pat Popric, chair of the Bucks County GOP, is a proud partisan. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3755.82s)]
*  But when it comes to running clean elections, she told us she's bipartisan. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3760.82s)]
*  We may like different candidates, but we want the process to be fair. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3766.22s)]
*  And I think we're working very hard in our county. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3769.98s)]
*  And I'm very, very proud of our commissioners, our board. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3771.94s)]
*  We're all working together to make sure the voters can vote. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3774.94s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3778.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3779.5s)]
*  But that spirit of cooperation only goes so far. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3780.82s)]
*  The number of Republican court cases keeps growing. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3784.54s)]
*  One of the fiercest concerns poll watchers. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3788.26s)]
*  The Trump campaign is in Pennsylvania courts alleging their observers can't get close [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3791.7000000000003s)]
*  enough to see what's going on. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3796.78s)]
*  President Trump railed about that in his speech Thursday night. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3798.98s)]
*  In Philadelphia, observers have been kept far away, very far away, so far that people [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3802.86s)]
*  are using binoculars to try and see. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3808.98s)]
*  And there's been tremendous problems caused. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3811.7000000000003s)]
*  It is reckless and disappointing that there are some on the outside who either don't know [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3814.2599999999998s)]
*  what's going on or don't care to know what's going on, who are lying about what's [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3820.2999999999997s)]
*  happening here in Pennsylvania. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3825.2599999999998s)]
*  Democrat Josh Shapiro is Pennsylvania's attorney general. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3827.3399999999997s)]
*  He won reelection this past week. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3831.18s)]
*  He's defending the state against Republican lawsuits he calls frivolous. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3833.8199999999997s)]
*  They were asking for two things, Bill. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3839.06s)]
*  Number one, to stop the count and number two, to allow their watchers to get closer to [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3841.14s)]
*  where the envelopes were being opened and scanned. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3848.8199999999997s)]
*  On the first issue, being able to stop the count, they failed. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3851.9399999999996s)]
*  And on the second thing, an agreement was reached to move these poll watchers from [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3855.14s)]
*  roughly 10 feet away to roughly six feet away. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3860.54s)]
*  No material change whatsoever. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3864.5s)]
*  The president and his campaign have said there are many irregularities here in Pennsylvania. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3866.22s)]
*  Let me break this down for you. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3873.06s)]
*  Each campaign had observers in the room while the ballots were being counted. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3874.86s)]
*  In addition to that, even if you're not a certified watcher, you can turn on the [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3880.74s)]
*  live stream and watch it on TV and keep an eye on the activity if you'd like. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3885.06s)]
*  You heard the president's speech on Thursday night. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3889.54s)]
*  He was claiming that the election is being stolen from him. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3893.82s)]
*  Donald Trump can say whatever he wants, but we just had an election, an election that [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3898.38s)]
*  was secure, an election where the votes are tallied and a proper winner will be [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3904.38s)]
*  certified based not on the words of President Trump, but the votes of the [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3909.1400000000003s)]
*  American people. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3914.46s)]
*  So get in line, stay in line, because it's all on the line. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3915.98s)]
*  Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta spent Election Day urging voters [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3920.98s)]
*  to get to the polls. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3926.38s)]
*  The Democrat represents a predominantly black district in North Philadelphia. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3928.1800000000003s)]
*  I think about the people who died. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3933.26s)]
*  I mean, literally died and bled. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3937.7400000000002s)]
*  So every single person could vote in this country. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3940.0600000000004s)]
*  He says the Trump campaign's attempt to stop the count smacks of voter suppression. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3944.1800000000003s)]
*  They're trying to steal an election by not having every vote count. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3949.5s)]
*  And in an election, if you think you're going to win, you don't try to stop the [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3957.78s)]
*  counting. You want every vote counted. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3961.3s)]
*  We're going to count every single vote. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3963.26s)]
*  And all they can do is what they've done to try to throw sand in the gears, to try [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3965.1400000000003s)]
*  to make the process as slow as possible and then fill that time of delay with [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3970.82s)]
*  conspiracy theories and nonsense. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3975.46s)]
*  So what do you think of this now that the Trump campaign is going to court [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3978.2599999999998s)]
*  complaining about these delays? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3983.06s)]
*  This is what the president does. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3985.18s)]
*  He wants to create confusion and chaos and then say, oh, my God, there's so much [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3987.42s)]
*  confusion and chaos. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3992.18s)]
*  And then I say, well, pick up a mirror. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3993.42s)]
*  Of course, there's confusion and chaos. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3994.8199999999997s)]
*  You created it. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3996.3399999999997s)]
*  I've been doing this a long time. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3997.86s)]
*  This is the type of litigation strategy where you throw the kitchen sink at the [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=3999.38s)]
*  wall and see what sticks. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4004.98s)]
*  Ben Ginsburg is a Republican attorney who has spent almost four decades immersed in [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4007.38s)]
*  election law. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4012.82s)]
*  During the Florida recount in 2000, he helped spearhead the controversial legal [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4017.02s)]
*  strategy that won the presidency for George W. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4022.46s)]
*  Bush. He says this is no Florida 2000 and calls President Trump's strategy [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4025.66s)]
*  incoherent. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4031.86s)]
*  What is this litigation designed to do? [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4033.3s)]
*  On the one hand, it's lawyers reacting to a client who is disjointed and unhinged [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4035.54s)]
*  and not terribly accepting of defeat. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4044.46s)]
*  And on the other extreme, this could be an instance of trying to slow down counts [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4047.46s)]
*  in individual states in the hopes that those states don't complete their job of [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4053.86s)]
*  certifying election results in time for the electoral college to meet. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4060.22s)]
*  And then he would go back to something else he's talked about, which is telling [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4065.18s)]
*  legislators to go and vote Trump's slates, even in states that were won by Biden. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4069.2999999999997s)]
*  Ginsburg, a lifelong Republican, hopes it doesn't come to that. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4077.4599999999996s)]
*  If you could get the ear of the president, what would you say to him? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4082.3399999999997s)]
*  Sir, you need to take a step back, look at the results. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4087.98s)]
*  It is a democracy. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4091.98s)]
*  It is a country that's been very good to you. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4093.58s)]
*  And you need to respect the institutions. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4096.18s)]
*  And the greatest institution of all is our elections that lead to the peaceful [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4099.18s)]
*  transfer of power. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4103.94s)]
*  And you cannot be destructive of that. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4105.5s)]
*  Saturday night, now president elect Joe Biden told voters the democratic process [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4108.54s)]
*  is working. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4114.7s)]
*  We've won with the most votes ever cast on presidential ticket in the history of [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4115.98s)]
*  the nation. Seventy four million. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4121.099999999999s)]
*  Not far from Independence Hall, the counting of provisional mail in and [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4125.78s)]
*  military ballots continues for Republican Election Commissioner Al Schmidt. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4130.26s)]
*  Each ballot is a precious reminder of what's at stake. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4135.58s)]
*  The real damage is not who wins and who loses or who gets elected or not. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4139.74s)]
*  The real damage, I think, is how we all react to this process so that at the end [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4145.82s)]
*  of the day, we all have confidence that all the voices are heard and win or lose. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4150.74s)]
*  These are the people that we the people have elected to represent us. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4156.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3L8IVHQ_7U&t=4175.74s)]
