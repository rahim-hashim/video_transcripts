**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU)
*  The governor of Texas is marshaling his own state's resources to take control of what [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=0.0s)]
*  he calls a failed federal response to the crisis at the border. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=12.32s)]
*  He's been criticized for playing politics with immigration, but he's doubling down on [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=16.52s)]
*  razor wire, soldiers and tough new laws. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  What gives you the authority to tell the U.S. Border Patrol what to do? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=24.76s)]
*  This land we're on right now was used by the federal government to further illegal activity [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=28.48s)]
*  and I wanted to put a stop to it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=34.24s)]
*  There were more than 3,000 book bans in public schools last year, 1,000 more than the year [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=38.52s)]
*  before. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=44.84s)]
*  We went to one conservative southern town to hear how they're turning the page. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  Parents have the right to determine what their children are taught and what they're allowed [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=52.84s)]
*  to read. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=57.48s)]
*  But what we're having a problem with is parents that want to determine what other parents' [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=58.48s)]
*  rights are for their children to read what they want. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, two of the richest men in the world, are in a race to help NASA [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=70.56s)]
*  put astronauts back on the moon and then on to Mars. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=76.56s)]
*  And liftoff of Artemis 1. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=81.6s)]
*  It's not science fiction, but it's also not easy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=83.76s)]
*  And that's our story tonight. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=87.48s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=89.48s)]
*  I'm Bill Whittaker. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=98.84s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=100.12s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=101.84s)]
*  This past week, both President Biden and former President Trump visited the southern border [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=112.96s)]
*  in Texas. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=117.6s)]
*  There's no denying immigration has become one of the most important and contentious [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=119.0s)]
*  issues in the presidential campaign. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  And there's no better example of that than the high stakes fight between the state of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=125.96s)]
*  Texas and the federal government. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=129.76s)]
*  Three years ago, Texas Governor Greg Abbott launched Operation Lone Star, deploying thousands [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=132.4s)]
*  of police and soldiers and miles of barriers to deter record numbers of illegal crossings. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=137.82s)]
*  The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that immigration is the job of the federal government, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=143.94s)]
*  but rarely has a state so aggressively challenge that authority. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  In January, Governor Abbott ordered his state national guard to block the federal government's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=153.62s)]
*  border patrol from Shelby Park, a dusty stretch of border along the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=158.38s)]
*  Texas. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=164.62s)]
*  To understand why, you need to see what happened there in December. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=165.62s)]
*  We were on the banks of the river before dawn with soldiers from the Texas National Guard. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=171.18s)]
*  We heard the cries of people before we could see their faces. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=176.34s)]
*  It wasn't until we moved closer that we realized how many people had just crossed from Mexico. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=181.66s)]
*  The soldiers told them it was dangerous to cross here. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=189.74s)]
*  Help us, they begged. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  Some of the women cried. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=198.74s)]
*  We have children. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  We heard groans and found this young man twisting in the wire. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=204.34s)]
*  He kept going. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=210.38s)]
*  Stay calm, they told each other as families pushed their children through. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=215.54s)]
*  Nearly everyone we saw made it across and into the United States. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  Thousands of people a day crossed here in late December, a record for this section of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=231.62s)]
*  the Texas border. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=235.7s)]
*  There were so many people, the U.S. Border Patrol had to transform Shelby Park into an [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=237.98s)]
*  open air holding center. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=243.42s)]
*  Weeks later, once the surge died down, Governor Abbott ordered his Texas National Guard to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=245.94s)]
*  block the federal government's Border Patrol from entering the park without permission. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=250.98s)]
*  Governor Abbott argued the federal government had failed to fulfill its obligation to the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=256.1s)]
*  states. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=260.62s)]
*  And in that, some heard echoes of Texas's history of rebellion and threats of secession. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=261.62s)]
*  I can't believe, Governor, I'm going to ask you this question, but I'm going to ask you, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=267.26s)]
*  Do you believe that Texas has the right to secede? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=271.14s)]
*  Is that what we're talking about here? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=274.12s)]
*  Those are false narratives, what Texas and the United States have the right to do, and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=275.78s)]
*  that's to enforce the law. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=281.86s)]
*  You heard the argument against what you're doing out here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=283.34s)]
*  Each state can't control its own border policy. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=286.09999999999997s)]
*  You're looking at a completely chaotic system. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=288.58s)]
*  That's the job of the federal government. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  We're not imposing a Texas border policy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=292.06s)]
*  Texas very simply is enforcing the laws that are the policy of the United States Congress. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=295.26s)]
*  What gives you the authority to tell the U.S. Border Patrol what to do? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=301.14s)]
*  For one, as governor of the state of Texas, I have the authority to control ingress and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=304.74s)]
*  egress to any land in the state of Texas. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  For another, this land we're on right now was used by the federal government to further [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=312.5s)]
*  illegal activity, and I wanted to put a stop to it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=317.74s)]
*  We went behind the guarded gates of Shelby Park in January, shortly after Governor Abbott [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=321.65999999999997s)]
*  had taken control. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=326.46s)]
*  So this is called an anti-climb barrier. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=327.46s)]
*  Texas Department of Public Safety Lieutenant Christopher Olivares showed us where state [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=329.94s)]
*  national guardsmen were installing fresh razor wire barriers along the river. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=334.34s)]
*  Help me understand at the heart of this why Texas has a problem with the Border Patrol [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=339.26s)]
*  coming in to process migrants in this park. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=346.14s)]
*  The issue is trying to prevent another influx because when Border Patrol is here setting [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=349.14s)]
*  up a processing center, it's going to attract, it's going to encourage more migrants to cross [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=354.76s)]
*  the river because they know where to go. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=359.4s)]
*  It's one of many spots along the Texas border where coils of sharp wire have been going [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=361.92s)]
*  up ever since Governor Abbott launched Operation Lone Star in 2021. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=366.44s)]
*  Since then, thousands of migrants have been arrested and detained on trespassing charges. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=372.0s)]
*  State troopers have cracked down on human smuggling rings. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=379.48s)]
*  And the state has spent more than $150 million sending migrants on buses to cities like New [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=383.52s)]
*  York and Chicago, turning the trouble at the border into a political and financial headache [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=389.38s)]
*  for Democratic mayors. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=394.78000000000003s)]
*  Once the site of ballgames and flea markets, Shelby Park is now Governor Abbott's model [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=397.06s)]
*  of what the Texas border can be. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=402.18s)]
*  Where we are right now, there used to be 3,000 or 4,000 people crossing illegally a day. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=404.54s)]
*  For the past three days, there's an average of just three people crossing the border illegally. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=410.74s)]
*  You don't just plant a flag just to plant a flag. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=416.06s)]
*  It's got to be strategic and it's got to make sense. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=418.38s)]
*  Raul Ortiz served as chief of the U.S. Border Patrol under President Biden and deputy chief [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=421.38s)]
*  under President Trump. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=426.94s)]
*  He retired last year. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=428.53999999999996s)]
*  When agencies are making a decision based upon politics or whether they're going to [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=430.26s)]
*  get media coverage, hey, we're going to put all our personnel in this two mile stretch. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=436.05999999999995s)]
*  What about the other 200 miles? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=441.14s)]
*  In our interview, Ortiz criticized Governor Abbott for not cooperating with the Border [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=442.97999999999996s)]
*  Patrol and playing politics with immigration. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=447.5s)]
*  But he also expressed frustration with President Biden. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=450.90000000000003s)]
*  I've never had one conversation with the president or the vice president for that matter. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=454.38s)]
*  And so I was the chief of the Border Patrol. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=459.38s)]
*  I commanded 21,000 people. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=461.62s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=465.06s)]
*  I just saw 50 people today who had just crossed the border illegally. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=466.06s)]
*  So something's not working. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=472.54s)]
*  We need to make sure that Central America, South America, Mexico, that those regions [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=474.5s)]
*  understand that if you pay a smuggler and you cross in between the ports of entry and [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=480.82s)]
*  you do not have a legitimate claim to some sort of asylum benefit, you're going to be [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=485.85999999999996s)]
*  sent back. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=491.09999999999997s)]
*  Do you believe that the White House has sent mixed messages to migrants? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=492.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, most definitely. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=496.06s)]
*  We spoke with Ortiz in an area just four miles south of Shelby Park. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=497.97999999999996s)]
*  The ground was littered with wet clothes that migrants had changed out of and left behind [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=502.7s)]
*  after crossing the river. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=507.21999999999997s)]
*  Does all of this tell you that people are still crossing this river right here? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=509.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=514.66s)]
*  The guides or the smugglers will bring the migrants over. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=515.66s)]
*  This is all very calculated by the cartels that control these areas on the Mexican side. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=518.74s)]
*  About seven miles north of Shelby Park, we came upon this group of migrants who had just [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=524.3s)]
*  crossed the Rio Grande and were being picked up by the border patrol. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=529.16s)]
*  This mother and her two sons took buses from El Salvador. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=536.68s)]
*  She told us the soldiers on the U.S. side of the border weren't much of a deterrent. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  She feared the cartels in Mexico more. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=545.02s)]
*  Sometimes they kidnap you and expect payment, she said. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=548.68s)]
*  The reality is people are still going to find a way to get in no matter how much manpower [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=552.48s)]
*  you have out here, no matter how much wire you put up. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=556.8399999999999s)]
*  It's a great complaint. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=559.12s)]
*  You do? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=560.12s)]
*  Yeah, because in Texas anyway, we're going to be barricading every area where people [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=561.12s)]
*  are crossing until we get every area to have like this area is right now. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=565.44s)]
*  Texas is going to barricade every area? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=571.2s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=573.6s)]
*  Every area where the cartels use as a crossing, we intend to be barricading. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=574.72s)]
*  The border is going to look like a war zone. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=578.52s)]
*  It is a war zone. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=580.76s)]
*  Over the past three years, the Biden administration has carried out four million expulsions and [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=582.0s)]
*  deportations, more than the Trump administration. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=586.96s)]
*  But it has also allowed a record three million people to remain in the country for years [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=590.44s)]
*  while their immigration cases are heard. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=595.5600000000001s)]
*  And the Border Patrol estimates another 1.6 million people have entered the country illegally [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=598.12s)]
*  without getting caught. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=603.6s)]
*  This past week, former President Trump visited Shelby Park with Governor Abbott. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=605.6s)]
*  On the same day, President Biden was also at the Texas border in Brownsville. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=610.6s)]
*  Instead of playing politics with the issue, why don't we just get together and get it done? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=615.12s)]
*  President Biden says that if Republicans were serious about securing the border, they would [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=618.56s)]
*  not have rejected a bipartisan immigration deal in the Senate last month after former [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=623.36s)]
*  President Trump opposed it. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=628.24s)]
*  That deal would have increased funding for the Border Patrol and required the president [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=630.68s)]
*  to expel all migrants crossing illegally during surges like the one at Shelby Park in December. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=634.8s)]
*  The latest battle between Texas and Washington concerns a new law Governor Abbott signed [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=642.04s)]
*  authorizing Texas's more than 2,700 law enforcement agencies to arrest migrants for illegally [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=646.92s)]
*  crossing the border. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=653.16s)]
*  Texas judges could then order migrants to return to Mexico or serve time, bypassing [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=655.12s)]
*  the federal immigration system entirely. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=660.1999999999999s)]
*  Critics of the law say it is so broadly written, it fails to define when authorities can stop [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=663.8399999999999s)]
*  someone. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=669.16s)]
*  We asked Lieutenant Olivares of the Texas Department of Public Safety, or DPS, about [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=670.56s)]
*  the concern that immigrants and people of color could be subjected to racial profiling. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=675.56s)]
*  I can tell you that our troopers are not going to be stopping cars and checking for immigration [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=680.68s)]
*  status. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=683.3199999999999s)]
*  They're not. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  But this law is not just written for DPS. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=685.3199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=686.8399999999999s)]
*  It's a Texas law. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=687.8399999999999s)]
*  The reality is, this is going to be carried out far from the border. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=688.8399999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  So couldn't you get caught up in it? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=693.0799999999999s)]
*  You're Latino. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=696.4s)]
*  Couldn't I get caught up in it? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=697.4s)]
*  That's not the case. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=698.4s)]
*  You have to develop probable cause in order to stop a car. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=699.4s)]
*  You can't just go interview every single person in that car, ask them for immigration status. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=702.0s)]
*  But of course, yeah, there could be some issues where maybe some other agency outside of a [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=706.88s)]
*  border area could take that into account. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=710.4399999999999s)]
*  And it's probably... [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=713.48s)]
*  Is that making you nervous? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=714.48s)]
*  It's probably because there's a lot of agencies here in Texas that operate, right? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=715.48s)]
*  But I would think that every chief at a police agency would have to implement some type of [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=717.92s)]
*  policy and procedure to actually enforce this new law. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=721.84s)]
*  A federal judge temporarily stopped the new law from taking effect while it's being challenged [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=726.64s)]
*  in court. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=731.64s)]
*  The Department of Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union are suing Texas, arguing [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=732.7199999999999s)]
*  the law interferes with the federal government's authority over immigration. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=737.88s)]
*  But Governor Abbott argues Texas is being invaded and has the right to defend itself. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=742.4399999999999s)]
*  That idea has resonated with militias and groups opposed to illegal immigration. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=748.5799999999999s)]
*  Tom joined a convoy last month and descended on the Eagle Pass area. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=753.88s)]
*  Everyone, I think, agrees that the immigration system right now is completely broken and [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=758.08s)]
*  there's a lot of blame to go around. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=763.68s)]
*  But do you really truly believe that invasion is the right word to be using here? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=766.12s)]
*  Invasion is the word that's used in the United States Constitution. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=773.2s)]
*  Invasion or imminent danger. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=776.84s)]
*  I use them both. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=778.88s)]
*  We are in imminent danger because of what the drug cartels do every single day, because [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=780.6800000000001s)]
*  of the known and unknown terrorists who cross every single day. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=786.4000000000001s)]
*  So the convoys and militia have heard the language and they've started to come to the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=791.1600000000001s)]
*  point that migrants have had to be relocated from some locations for their own safety. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=796.32s)]
*  Are you not concerned about violence happening because of language like the word invasion? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=801.36s)]
*  There's no language that would spur violence. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=806.7600000000001s)]
*  I'll be clear about this. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=808.28s)]
*  We don't want violence of any type. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=810.24s)]
*  How does this end? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=812.0799999999999s)]
*  Oh, it is very simple. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=813.56s)]
*  And that's with a president of the United States who will actually fulfill his oath [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=815.9599999999999s)]
*  of office and enforce the laws of the United States of America. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=819.8399999999999s)]
*  That means denying illegal entry into our country. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=823.56s)]
*  Do you want to be Trump's running mate? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=826.0s)]
*  No. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=827.56s)]
*  What if he asks you? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=828.56s)]
*  Listen, I love being governor of Texas. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=829.56s)]
*  I can best aid him in my role by being a great governor of Texas. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=833.5200000000001s)]
*  So far, the governor has committed more than $11 billion to Operation Lone Star. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  Over the last three years, the percentage of people entering Texas illegally has dropped [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=844.48s)]
*  while rising in other border states. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=849.8000000000001s)]
*  Abbott's critics say that has more to do with other factors like crackdowns on migration [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=852.48s)]
*  in parts of Mexico. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=857.36s)]
*  There are still more than a million illegal border crossings in Texas every year. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=859.4s)]
*  There are also at least a dozen lawsuits being fought between Texas and the federal government [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=864.56s)]
*  over immigration issues. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=869.4s)]
*  All that in-fighting worries former Border Patrol chief Raul Ortiz. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=871.24s)]
*  The National Guardsmen, even to some degree the Border Patrol agents, have become pawns [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=875.56s)]
*  in this political game between the two sides. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=879.8s)]
*  Who's winning? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=882.28s)]
*  The cartels, the criminal organizations, that's who's winning in all of this. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=883.28s)]
*  They're sitting back reaping all the benefits while they watch the state of Texas and Washington, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=887.28s)]
*  D.C. go at it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=893.4399999999999s)]

*  At 60minutesovertime.com. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=905.6s)]
*  With election season upon us, the forces of politics are pulling us apart. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=907.6s)]
*  And among the sharpest battles recently is a campaign to ban certain books from public schools. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=919.28s)]
*  There were more than 3,000 book bans in schools last year, a thousand more than the year before. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=926.8000000000001s)]
*  That rise is inspired in part by Moms for Liberty, a Florida-based conservative group [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=933.96s)]
*  that says it is fighting for the survival of America. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=940.4399999999999s)]
*  You might expect a sympathetic ear in Beaufort, South Carolina. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=945.12s)]
*  The county votes Republican and is home to many veterans who did fight for America. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=948.92s)]
*  But when two people demanded the banning of 97 books, Beaufort found itself in a battle [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=954.9399999999999s)]
*  over the true meaning of liberty. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=961.88s)]
*  Beaufort has a history in literature and learning. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=968.0s)]
*  It's the hometown of the late novelist Pat Conroy, Prince of Tides, and in 1862 it opened [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=971.84s)]
*  among the first schools in the South for former slaves. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=979.4s)]
*  Today, Beaufort County has 21,000 students and Dick Geyer is vice chair of the school board. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=984.04s)]
*  It is probably the most diverse district in the United States because we have tremendous [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=991.44s)]
*  wealth and Hilton Head and other gated communities here and we have tremendous poverty. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=997.84s)]
*  Half of our students are getting free and reduced lunches because their parents are [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1004.0s)]
*  qualified as being in poverty. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1008.6400000000001s)]
*  Geyer is a retired Army colonel, a Republican, who focused on improving math and reading [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1011.5200000000001s)]

*  What was the very first notion that you had a storm coming? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1021.2s)]
*  We got an email from a citizen saying that these 97 books that we've heard about online [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1027.5800000000002s)]

*  So we checked. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1046.52s)]
*  We had virtually all those books in the school. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1047.68s)]
*  They're mostly young adult novels with minority, gay, lesbian, or transgender characters. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1051.6000000000001s)]
*  Some depict sex and violence. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1058.28s)]
*  Most were in high school libraries, four were in classroom curricula. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1061.28s)]
*  Reasonable people disagree about books and that's why Beaufort already gave the last [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1066.96s)]
*  word to parents. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1072.88s)]
*  Karen Garris is a high school librarian after 27 years in the Navy. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1075.12s)]
*  So the procedure would be that it's a conversation between myself and the parent and if they [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1080.1599999999999s)]
*  don't like the book they have every right to say that their child can't check that book [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1084.76s)]
*  out. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1088.3999999999999s)]
*  And how often does a parent do that? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1089.4799999999998s)]
*  I have never had a parent come and complain to me personally about a book. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1091.3999999999999s)]
*  Garris also pointed to this opt-out form. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1096.76s)]
*  Do not allow my child to check out any school library materials without my approval. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1100.56s)]
*  Parents have the right to determine what their children are taught and what they're allowed [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1108.04s)]
*  to read. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1113.36s)]
*  No doubt about it. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1114.36s)]
*  But what we're having a problem with is parents that want to determine what other parents' [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1116.52s)]
*  rights are for their children to read what they want. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1121.76s)]

*  theories threatened librarians and board members calling them groomers. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1133.4s)]
*  Extreme right-wing hate speech meant to brand opponents as molesters grooming children for [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1140.04s)]
*  sex. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1147.1200000000001s)]
*  We've had a parent come in and tell a librarian that you are violating a state statute by [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1148.12s)]
*  providing pornography to a minor. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1156.9199999999998s)]

*  Now that's not just happened once. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1167.04s)]
*  That's happened multiple times at multiple schools. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1169.32s)]
*  I even got an email saying, okay, the sheriff has said no, the solicitor said no, I'm going [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1172.28s)]
*  to the FBI. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1177.6s)]
*  School superintendent Frank Rodriguez feared violence so he pulled the books. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1179.56s)]
*  From someone outside looking in, it's almost obvious that most of the books hadn't been [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1186.08s)]
*  read prior to being challenged, that some other source was used to gather these things [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1191.04s)]
*  together. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1194.9199999999998s)]

*  That road began here. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1201.7199999999998s)]
*  A book review website called BookLooks, founded two years ago by a Florida nurse. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1204.08s)]
*  She declined an interview but told us her book reviews are written by volunteers using [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1211.6399999999999s)]
*  BookLooks' own standards. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1217.78s)]

*  Across the country, book bans are being demanded based on BookLooks' amateur volunteer reviews, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1225.12s)]

*  Tina Duskovich. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1264.58s)]
*  The truth of the matter is that Tina and I are disrupting the balance of power in American [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1266.46s)]
*  education. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1271.04s)]

*  For too long, unions have had an undue influence in the decision-making process happening in [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1279.36s)]
*  our local schools. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1285.08s)]
*  And we see where that has gotten us. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1286.6s)]
*  A system that protects itself and oftentimes leaves the needs of students behind. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1288.84s)]
*  And that has to change. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1295.72s)]
*  Conservative, anti-teachers unions, Moms for Liberty is part of the pushback against the [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1297.6799999999998s)]
*  diversity and inclusion movement. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1304.12s)]

*  orientation and gender identity through high school. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1314.32s)]
*  We love teachers. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1318.52s)]
*  My children have had the best teachers. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1319.52s)]

*  Rogue teachers. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1326.96s)]
*  Rogue teachers. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1327.96s)]
*  Parents send their children to school to be educated, not indoctrinated into ideology. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1328.96s)]
*  What ideology are they being indoctrinated into? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1332.98s)]

*  They often dodged questions with talking points. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1341.48s)]
*  You're being evasive. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1345.04s)]
*  21 percent of Hispanic students are reading on grade level. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1346.04s)]
*  You're being evasive. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1349.04s)]
*  What ideology are the children being indoctrinated into? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1350.04s)]
*  What is your fear? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1353.52s)]
*  I think parents' fears are realized. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1355.16s)]
*  They're looking at these books where sexual discussions are happening with their children [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1357.76s)]
*  at younger and younger ages. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1361.8600000000001s)]
*  Tiffany Justice read from sexually explicit books written for older teens but found in [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1363.8s)]
*  a few lower schools. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1370.58s)]
*  Most people wouldn't want them in a lower school. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1372.82s)]
*  But in a tactic of outrage politics, Moms for Liberty takes a kernel of truth and concludes [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1375.8799999999999s)]
*  these examples are not rare mistakes but a plot to sexualize children. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1383.18s)]
*  Your critics say that you have an anti-gay ideology. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1390.06s)]
*  That is false. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1392.8999999999999s)]
*  That is false. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1394.8999999999999s)]
*  Nothing could be further from the truth. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1395.8999999999999s)]
*  We have gay members. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1397.42s)]
*  I think it's an effort to really try to marginalize us as an organization because parents are [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1399.3799999999999s)]
*  coming together across racial lines, across religious lines, across all of these different [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1403.82s)]
*  ways that we see Americans being divided so often. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1408.62s)]
*  But voters have not come together for Moms for Liberty. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1414.18s)]
*  Last year, moms endorsed 166 school board candidates. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1419.06s)]
*  Two-thirds were defeated, according to the nonpartisan Brookings Institution. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1423.82s)]

*  Her husband, Christian Zeigler, had been accused of rape in another incident. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1452.02s)]
*  Investigators concluded that alleged attack was, quote, likely consensual. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1458.42s)]
*  But Christian Zeigler was forced out as chair of the Florida Republican Party. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1464.22s)]
*  We wanted to know about the messages on Moms' ex-account, which adopts the extremist smear [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1471.46s)]
*  with, if they don't like being called groomers, they should stop trying to groom our kids. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1478.46s)]
*  What are you trying to say? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1485.14s)]
*  Well, I'm going to say that if we have to see the exact tweet, Tiffany manages our Twitter [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1486.3400000000001s)]

*  Again, Justice Anduskovich went to their talking points. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1503.14s)]
*  I'm just asking, what do you mean by that? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1507.36s)]
*  What do you mean by grooming? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1509.12s)]
*  Parents want to partner with their children's schools, but we do not co-parent with the [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1510.6799999999998s)]

*  Don't do that to these kids. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1548.8s)]
*  They have the internet. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1550.56s)]
*  They're going to get to it anyways. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1551.56s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1553.84s)]
*  You're wasting your time. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1554.84s)]

*  Per launch. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1857.26s)]
*  That's an incredible amount of money per launch. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1858.26s)]
*  A lot of that hardware is just going to end up in the ocean never to be used again. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1859.9799999999998s)]

*  Is he wrong? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1872.94s)]
*  We didn't necessarily agree with their conclusions. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1874.22s)]

*  Jim Free is NASA's associate administrator and directly in charge of Artemis. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1884.0600000000002s)]

*  one in the world that can take crews to the moon. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1903.1000000000001s)]

*  They're not reusable and with the goal of building an outpost on the moon, Artemis will [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1915.54s)]
*  need a lot of those $4.2 billion rockets. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1921.18s)]

*  Yes. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=1930.86s)]

*  My view of that is we have a contract with SpaceX that says they're going to launch our [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2182.94s)]
*  crew in the end of 2026. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2187.86s)]
*  Why does it really matter when we get back to the moon? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2191.26s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2194.66s)]
*  China has said it plans to send its taikonauts to the moon by the end of the decade. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2196.18s)]
*  And NASA Administrator Bill Nelson has publicly expressed concern. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2201.3799999999997s)]
*  Naturally, I don't want China to get to the South Pole first with humans and then say, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2206.3399999999997s)]
*  this is ours. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2216.54s)]
*  Stay out. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2218.2599999999998s)]
*  To ensure that the U.S. will plant its flag first, NASA signed a new $3 billion contract [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2221.1s)]
*  last year with Blue Origin, the space company owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, to build [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2229.2599999999998s)]
*  another lunar lander. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2235.18s)]
*  And Jim Freeh is crystal clear that he sees it as an option if SpaceX Starships keep blowing [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2237.14s)]
*  up. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2243.3399999999997s)]
*  If we have a problem with one, we'll have another one to rely on. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2244.3399999999997s)]
*  If we have a dependency on a particular aspect in SpaceX or Blue Origin and it doesn't work [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2248.42s)]
*  out, then we have another lander that can take our crews. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2254.26s)]
*  In this battle of the stargazing billionaires, Bezos' Blue Origin has far fewer launches [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2258.02s)]
*  than Musk's SpaceX and has been far quieter about its ambitions until now. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2263.94s)]
*  So what we're looking to do is not only get to the moon and back, but make it reliable [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2270.5s)]
*  and repeatable and low cost. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2275.38s)]
*  John Koulouris' title at Blue Origin is Senior Vice President of Lunar Permanence and it [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2277.26s)]
*  says a lot about the company's ambition. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2283.26s)]
*  The landers that Blue Origin is going to be building are reusable. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2286.1000000000004s)]
*  We'll launch them to lunar orbit and we'll leave them there and we'll refuel them in [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2289.78s)]
*  orbit so that multiple astronauts can use the same vehicle back and forth. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2294.1000000000004s)]
*  Our cameras were among the first to be allowed inside Blue Origin's huge complex in Florida. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2300.3s)]
*  It's next to Kennedy Space Center. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2307.06s)]
*  This is where the future is being built. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2309.54s)]
*  That's right. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2312.66s)]
*  This is the main factory floor for the New Glenn rocket. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2313.66s)]
*  New Glenn is Blue Origin's first heavy lift rocket. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2316.94s)]
*  Its maiden launch will be sometime this year. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2321.08s)]
*  So you can see over here we have three different second stages already in build here. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2324.74s)]
*  The first New Glenn is already out at Blue Origin's launch complex. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2329.82s)]
*  It's designed to carry all sorts of payloads including the lunar lander being built for [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2334.38s)]
*  NASA. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2340.06s)]
*  So this is the Mark 1 lander. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2341.06s)]
*  We call this our small lander. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2343.26s)]
*  This is the small one? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2345.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2346.3s)]
*  It's actually a mock-up of their cargo lander in Blue Origin's Florida lobby. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2347.3s)]
*  John Koulouris used to work at SpaceX and he came over to Blue to help speed things [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2352.7000000000003s)]
*  up. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2358.1800000000003s)]
*  Is there a bit of a space race between you and SpaceX? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2359.1800000000003s)]
*  So the country needs competition. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2363.82s)]
*  We need options. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2367.98s)]
*  Competition brings innovation. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2369.94s)]
*  But you haven't had anything close to the accomplishments that SpaceX has had at this [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2371.78s)]
*  point, have you? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2379.06s)]
*  SpaceX has done some amazing things and they've changed the narrative for access to space [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2381.6600000000003s)]
*  and Blue Origin's looking to do the same. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2386.2000000000003s)]
*  This lander, we're expecting to land on the moon between 12 and 16 months from today. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2388.56s)]
*  12 and 16 months from today? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2395.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2398.16s)]
*  And I understand I'm saying that publicly, but that's what our team is aiming towards. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2399.16s)]
*  But that's for the cargo lander. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2403.7599999999998s)]
*  What about humans? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2406.7599999999998s)]
*  For humans, we're working with NASA on the Artemis V mission. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2408.36s)]
*  That's planned for 2029. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2412.48s)]
*  It's not so different from Elon Musk's forecast of when SpaceX can land humans back on the [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2415.12s)]
*  moon, even if it doesn't match NASA's. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2420.2799999999997s)]
*  Like the Starship, Blue Origin's lander will require in-space refueling. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2423.6s)]
*  But Koulouris insists that it and their rocket will help NASA trim costs. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2429.16s)]
*  Our new Glenn vehicle will be a reusable vehicle from its first mission. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2434.96s)]
*  That lander for the astronauts is a reusable lander. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2439.46s)]
*  So now you're not just taking the equipment and throwing it away. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2442.96s)]
*  You're reusing it for the next mission. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2446.0s)]
*  You do it again and again and again. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2447.88s)]
*  Is that where the cost savings comes in? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2449.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2451.7200000000003s)]
*  We are now building with NASA the infrastructure to ensure lunar permanency. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2452.7200000000003s)]
*  You have said that the Artemis program is the beginning, not the end. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2458.7200000000003s)]
*  Tell me, what is the future you see? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2464.04s)]
*  I see us landing on Mars. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2466.68s)]
*  Absolutely see us landing on Mars. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2469.96s)]
*  Do we have to work through the moon to get to Mars? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2471.64s)]
*  These are magnificent goals. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2475.08s)]
*  Going back to the moon, going to Mars. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2478.4s)]
*  Do we have the ability to do what we're dreaming of doing? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2481.56s)]
*  This is NASA. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2485.96s)]
*  This agency is destined to continue to do great things. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2488.0s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2490.96s)]
*  What we're telling the agency is just be more realistic. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2492.58s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with being optimistic. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2495.18s)]
*  In fact, it's required. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2496.4s)]
*  In this business, optimism is required. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2498.44s)]
*  The question is though, can you also be more realistic? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2500.44s)]
*  The last minute of 60 minutes is sponsored by UnitedHealthcare. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2503.88s)]
*  There for what matters. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2516.84s)]
*  Now an update of a story Bill Whitaker reported six years ago. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2521.44s)]
*  In the year 79, Mount Vesuvius erupted, Pompeii and the seaside city of Herculaneum were [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2525.62s)]
*  buried. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2531.38s)]
*  At one villa, a library's nearly 2,000 scrolls turned into brittle carbonized lumps. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2532.5s)]
*  The University of Kentucky's Brent Seals has spent years trying to unlock the scroll's [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2538.42s)]
*  secrets. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2543.54s)]
*  The history of the unwrapping of the Herculaneum scrolls is littered with failures. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2544.72s)]
*  Everyone who had tried to open the scrolls had left behind a hideous trail of fragmentary [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2551.66s)]
*  result. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2556.3399999999997s)]
*  Professor Seals co-founded an international competition to read the scrolls. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2558.22s)]
*  Now three students using Seals data and techniques have succeeded in deciphering one, a philosophical [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2562.8999999999996s)]
*  work on pleasure. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2569.3999999999996s)]
*  The Vesuvius challenge winners will share a $700,000 prize. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2571.24s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2576.48s)]
*  We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDOzN76fNU&t=2577.48s)]
