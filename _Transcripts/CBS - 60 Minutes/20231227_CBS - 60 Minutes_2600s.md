# Sperm Whales of Dominica; Monkey Island; Sloths | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [December 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc)
*  Tonight on this special edition of 60 Minutes presents [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=0.0s)]
*  Animal Magnetism. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=6.0s)]
*  What's it like to be in the water with them? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=8.0s)]
*  Magical. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=12.0s)]
*  60 Minutes is eye to eye with the whale of Moby Dick legend. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=13.0s)]
*  But Melville's novel was fiction. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=18.0s)]
*  Sperm whales are especially maternal. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=21.0s)]
*  Generations live together while taking care of their calves, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=23.0s)]
*  and they have the biggest brain in the animal kingdom. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=27.0s)]
*  And they sleep like this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=30.0s)]
*  There are roughly 1800 monkeys on Cayo Santiago. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=36.0s)]
*  They live in isolation in what is a natural laboratory. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=40.0s)]
*  Today, scientists are studying how the stress of a devastating hurricane [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=47.0s)]
*  affected their overall health and relationships [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=52.0s)]
*  and what that might teach us about ourselves [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=56.0s)]
*  since we share 94% of our DNA with them. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=59.0s)]
*  So the two toads I always say look like a cross between a wookie and a pig [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=66.0s)]
*  because they've got that sort of beepable nose. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=69.0s)]
*  And then these ones have the sort of, you know, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=71.0s)]
*  beetles, haircuts and Mona Lisa smiles. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=74.0s)]
*  Behind that ringer for Ringo, Cook says, is a secret. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=77.0s)]
*  Being nature's couch potato is the reason sloths have survived [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=81.0s)]
*  for more than 60 million years in spite of, well, themselves. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=85.0s)]
*  Good evening. I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=97.0s)]
*  Welcome to 60 Minutes Presents. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=99.0s)]
*  Tonight, three stories of animal magnetism attract us. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=101.0s)]
*  Leslie Stahl pays a visit to Monkey Island off the coast of Puerto Rico, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=105.0s)]
*  where the inhabitants roam free and have much to teach the scientists who study them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=109.0s)]
*  Sharon Alfonsi moves ever so slowly among the Central American treetops with sloths. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=114.0s)]
*  But we begin in the depths of the Caribbean Sea. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=120.0s)]
*  In 2022, nearly every member country of the United Nations [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=124.0s)]
*  pledged to protect at least 30% of the world's land and sea by 2030 [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=128.0s)]
*  to reverse the damage done by humans and protect vulnerable species. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=133.0s)]
*  One of the animals at risk is also one of the largest in the ocean [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=138.0s)]
*  and among the least understood. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=142.0s)]
*  Sperm whales are not the predators of Moby Dick legend. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=144.0s)]
*  They have brains six times larger than ours [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=148.0s)]
*  and spend most of their lives in the darkest depths of the ocean. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=151.0s)]
*  It is difficult to describe their size without comparing them to a school bus. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=155.0s)]
*  Last spring, we traveled with National Geographic explorer Enrique Sala [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=160.0s)]
*  to the Caribbean island of Dominica, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=164.0s)]
*  where he proposed protections for the hundreds of sperm whales living there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=167.0s)]
*  You guys ready? Go, go, go! Go, go! Go, guys, go! [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=173.0s)]
*  Look in the water, coming straight to you, yeah! [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=177.0s)]
*  Most of Enrique Sala's dives don't start like a fire drill, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=180.0s)]
*  even though he has spent thousands of hours underwater as an explorer. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=184.0s)]
*  Look down. Hand in back of you, look! This way! This way! [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=188.0s)]
*  We came face to face with a pod of whales, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=191.0s)]
*  but these are not the whales we traveled all this way to see. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=194.0s)]
*  They are pygmy killer whales, known to threaten sperm whales. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=198.0s)]
*  And because they are here, the sperm whales are not. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=202.0s)]
*  These killer whales can grow up to eight and a half feet in size. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=206.0s)]
*  Sala told us seeing them up close almost never happens. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=210.0s)]
*  You've never been able to get into the water with one of these. They're that elusive. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=214.0s)]
*  They are very elusive. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=217.0s)]
*  Why is that? Why do you not see them? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=218.0s)]
*  They are very smart. They hunt like wolves. They hunt in groups. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=220.0s)]
*  They don't care about interacting with humans. They are after the prey. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=223.0s)]
*  We were off the coast of Dominica, a country in the eastern Caribbean. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=227.0s)]
*  Residents call it Nature Island. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=233.0s)]
*  Those rainforest-covered volcanic peaks drop thousands of feet down to the seafloor below, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=235.0s)]
*  which is why hundreds of sperm whales live in these waters. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=241.0s)]
*  They are one of the deepest diving mammals on the planet. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=245.0s)]
*  They are mostly females here, families made up of grandmothers, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=249.0s)]
*  mothers and daughters who stay together for life, nursing and raising their young. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=253.0s)]
*  When Enrique Sala was here, his National Geographic team filmed this. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=258.0s)]
*  It is a pod of sleeping female sperm whales, vertical giants up to 40 feet long, suspended near the surface. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=264.0s)]
*  Their nap lasts only about 15 minutes until the whales are ready to dive again [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=272.0s)]
*  in what can be an hour-long journey for squid thousands of feet down. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=277.0s)]
*  Even to researchers, why they sleep like this is one of the great mysteries. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=282.0s)]
*  What's it like to be in the water with them? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=287.0s)]
*  Magical. We have in our minds the legend of Moby Dick, these nasty aggressive animals. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=289.0s)]
*  But you jump in the water and they are so docile and gentle. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=295.0s)]
*  They have never attacked humans and they are so curious, especially the babies. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=299.0s)]
*  So it's one of the most amazing wildlife encounters that one can have on the planet. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=304.0s)]
*  Your official title is Explorer in Residence. Not bad. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=310.0s)]
*  It's an oxymoron. Explorers are not supposed to be in the past. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=315.0s)]
*  True, you're not supposed to be sitting in one place. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=318.0s)]
*  What does that mean to be an explorer in the year 2023? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=320.0s)]
*  Very different from what an explorer of the 19th century was. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=323.0s)]
*  I can dedicate my life and work with an amazing team of scientists, policy experts, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=328.0s)]
*  filmmakers, storytellers to work with local communities, governments, indigenous peoples [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=334.0s)]
*  to assess the health of ocean places and help to protect them. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=339.0s)]
*  He grew up north of Barcelona, Spain, near the coast. His first dive was in a marine reserve. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=345.0s)]
*  It drove everything that they have done afterwards. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=351.0s)]
*  If we give the ocean space, it can heal itself. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=354.0s)]
*  Salah moved to California, where he was a professor of marine ecology [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=358.0s)]
*  for seven years at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=362.0s)]
*  You have had a long career in academia at a top university, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=366.0s)]
*  and you tried that and decided not for me. You walked away. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=371.0s)]
*  I walked away because my job was to study the impacts of humans in the ocean, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=375.0s)]
*  the impacts of fishing and global warming. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=379.0s)]
*  And one day I realized that all I was doing was writing the obituary of the ocean. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=381.0s)]
*  Writing the obituary of the ocean? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=385.0s)]
*  Yeah, I felt like the doctor who's telling you how you're going to die [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=387.0s)]
*  with excruciating detail, but not offering a cure. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=390.0s)]
*  Have you found that cure? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=393.0s)]
*  There is one solution that is proven. It's a success story everywhere in the world, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=395.0s)]
*  which is marine reserves or marine protected areas, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=400.0s)]
*  areas where damaging activities are banned and marine life can come back. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=403.0s)]
*  He founded the Pristine Seas Project in 2008. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=409.0s)]
*  It combines sea exploration, scientific research and public policy, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=413.0s)]
*  and has worked with 17 countries to turn these large swaths of the ocean [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=418.0s)]
*  into marine protected areas. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=423.0s)]
*  In Dominica, scientists estimate the sperm whale population declines by 3 percent each year. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=427.0s)]
*  Salas says a preserve would protect them from their greatest threats, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=435.0s)]
*  not those pygmy killer whales we saw or whaling, which has been banned for decades, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=439.0s)]
*  but plastic trash, ocean noise pollution and ship strikes. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=444.0s)]
*  If they continue with the status quo here, what happens? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=449.0s)]
*  If nothing is done, the population will probably continue declining. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=453.0s)]
*  So reducing those threats, hopefully, will allow the sperm whale population to rebound. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=457.0s)]
*  And the more whales there are, the more benefits Dominica and the local communities will obtain. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=463.0s)]
*  Hurricane Maria devastated those communities in 2017. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=470.0s)]
*  Today, the island is continuing to rebuild and prepare for the future. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=475.0s)]
*  Francine Baron heads the agency in charge of that effort. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=480.0s)]
*  What was it about Hurricane Maria that made the leaders of this country say, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=484.0s)]
*  we have to do something, we really have to act? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=488.0s)]
*  We suffered the equivalent of 226 percent loss of GDP. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=491.0s)]
*  So we could see the trend and we realized that we needed to become much more resilient. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=494.0s)]
*  When Enrique Salas came to you with this idea of creating a sanctuary for these whales, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=501.0s)]
*  what was his pitch to you? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=507.0s)]
*  We see whale watching as an important part of our tourism product, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=508.0s)]
*  and it's something that needs to be protected. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=513.0s)]
*  And the idea of creating greater protection for the whales is something that Dominica is very open to. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=516.0s)]
*  And we were very pleased with the suggestion that Enrique made to create a recognized sanctuary for the whales. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=523.0s)]
*  Enrique Salas compares it to a model that has worked in Rwanda, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=531.0s)]
*  where protecting mountain gorillas helped bring tourism dollars to the local economy. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=535.0s)]
*  You going to find us some whales? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=542.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=544.0s)]
*  Captain Kurt Benoit was born and raised in Dominica [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=545.0s)]
*  and has been in the whale tourism business for more than two decades. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=548.0s)]
*  We set out on his 38-foot Lady Rose from a small fishing village on the West Coast. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=553.0s)]
*  Our government permit to swim with the whales was good for six days. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=560.0s)]
*  Captain Benoit uses a homemade device that picks up the distinct clicking of sperm whales as far as 11 miles away. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=566.0s)]
*  We got whales in the south. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=574.0s)]
*  Every three miles, we checked to see if we were getting closer. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=576.0s)]
*  It's come to papa. Daddy's here. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=580.0s)]
*  Tell me about this really high-tech device you've got here. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=583.0s)]
*  You have an underwater microphone which picks up sound from 360. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=586.0s)]
*  So what I did, I take a salad bowl with neoprene, so the hydrophone is kind of hidden. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=590.0s)]
*  So as it goes out, it actually brings you straight to wherever you hear the sound. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=595.0s)]
*  So this is a salad bowl from your house? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=600.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=601.0s)]
*  What do the whales sound like? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=602.0s)]
*  It's like a horse galloping on a hard surface. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=604.0s)]
*  So if we have several of them, that means there's a lot of whales there. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=607.0s)]
*  Let's keep them going, man. I'm going to find these guys. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=613.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=615.0s)]
*  On the second day, a water spout. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=616.0s)]
*  See it? It's right here. Look, guys. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=618.0s)]
*  See him? You can see its top. Look at him. Oh, my gosh. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=621.0s)]
*  No! Swimmers in the water. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=624.0s)]
*  Males here live with their families until their teen years. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=627.0s)]
*  Then they roam mostly alone, swimming thousands of miles away. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=630.0s)]
*  Caribbean male sperm whales have been found as far away as Norway, returning here only to mate. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=634.0s)]
*  Our cameraman got lucky enough or unlucky enough to have the whale poop on him. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=646.0s)]
*  So the whales go down, they hunt squid, they come back to the surface, they breathe, they rest, and they poop. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=652.0s)]
*  And that poop is full of nutrients, which fertilizes the shallow waters. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=659.0s)]
*  So a good thing, I guess. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=665.0s)]
*  It's a good thing. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=667.0s)]
*  Come on, people. We're looking for spouts. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=668.0s)]
*  But our luck didn't last. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=671.0s)]
*  Okay, guys, nothing is here. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=673.0s)]
*  We spent the next day searching for sperm whales and the next... [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=675.0s)]
*  Nothing at all? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=679.0s)]
*  Nothing at all. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=680.0s)]
*  And the next, not a single click. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=681.0s)]
*  Okay, guys, it's pretty quiet. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=685.0s)]
*  And then, in the last hour of the last day of our trip... [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=687.0s)]
*  Yeah, lots of animals in the area, guys. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=692.0s)]
*  They're coming back. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=697.0s)]
*  But I'm getting songs 360. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=699.0s)]
*  So that means the whales, we are above them. We're right there. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=702.0s)]
*  Yes, he blows! Yes, he blows! Yes, he blows! [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=706.0s)]
*  Go! Go! And stay there, it's coming to you! [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=710.0s)]
*  They're still there. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=714.0s)]
*  It's coming to you! [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=717.0s)]
*  We jumped in the water and a young female swam right to us. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=718.0s)]
*  She came within feet. At first, her size was terrifying. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=722.0s)]
*  She made a sound like a creaking door hinge. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=730.0s)]
*  It's one of the ways whales communicate and socialize. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=732.0s)]
*  With eyes on the side of her head, she stared right at us. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=736.0s)]
*  She had squid in her mouth, left over from lunch thousands of feet below. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=740.0s)]
*  She stayed and rolled around, and her jaw was wide open. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=747.0s)]
*  She was using echolocation, bouncing those clicks off of us, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=751.0s)]
*  trying to figure out what we were. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=755.0s)]
*  You could hear the clicking. You could hear her. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=761.0s)]
*  Once you were really close to her, you could hear her clicking. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=763.0s)]
*  Once you were really close to her, you could hear that so loudly. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=767.0s)]
*  I could feel it in my bones. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=771.0s)]
*  You grabbed my hand, you could tell I was nervous. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=773.0s)]
*  I was excited too. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=775.0s)]
*  They are huge. You have to respect them. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=777.0s)]
*  You have to respect them. There is a sense of awe that comes with being in there. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=780.0s)]
*  She was looking right at us. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=783.0s)]
*  And she left us a souvenir. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=785.0s)]
*  Piece of squid. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=788.0s)]
*  Sperm whales live in... [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=789.0s)]
*  Shane Giro is another National Geographic explorer. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=791.0s)]
*  He started the Dominica Sperm Whale Project, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=794.0s)]
*  and over the past 18 years, he's identified more than 35 families. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=797.0s)]
*  Did you recognize the whale that we saw? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=802.0s)]
*  The animal you met belongs to the EC2 clan, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=805.0s)]
*  the other clan of whales that we've known exists in the Caribbean, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=808.0s)]
*  but we haven't seen all that much. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=812.0s)]
*  And those groups identify themselves by making specific patterns of clicks called codas. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=814.0s)]
*  It's a part of who they are, where their grandmother grew up, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=820.0s)]
*  and so it really ties the animals and the place together. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=823.0s)]
*  What does the coda of the EC2 sound like? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=827.0s)]
*  They make the 5R3 coda, and it sounds like this. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=830.0s)]
*  Five slow clicks. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=834.0s)]
*  And she came up to you and made this 5R3 coda, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=840.0s)]
*  saying, I am from the EC2 clan, are you? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=843.0s)]
*  She was rolling around and she kept coming back, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=849.0s)]
*  but is that me assigning human characteristics to a whale, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=852.0s)]
*  or is she actually a playful animal? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=856.0s)]
*  These are the animals that are holding the largest brain to ever exist, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=859.0s)]
*  maybe in the universe, and they use that for complicated thinking and behavior. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=863.0s)]
*  Absolutely this was an animal that was playful, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=869.0s)]
*  and that curiosity of the animal actively coming towards you [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=872.0s)]
*  just shows that this is a sand animal that's investigating something in its world. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=875.0s)]
*  Back on the dock, Enrique Salas says it's that world he's trying to protect. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=880.0s)]
*  Being in the water with sperm whales is a magical experience. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=888.0s)]
*  There's something spiritual there. This is more than science and data. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=891.0s)]
*  A sense of awe and wonder that is unavoidable [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=897.0s)]
*  when you are in the water with these gentle giants. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=900.0s)]
*  In November, the Prime Minister of Dominica announced [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=905.0s)]
*  that the island nation will create the first sperm whale reserve in the world. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=909.0s)]
*  The sanctuary will be 300 square miles [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=914.0s)]
*  and have a new senior whale officer assigned to ensure the whale's safety. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=917.0s)]
*  Cecilia Vega describes what it was like swimming with sperm whales. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=927.0s)]
*  She is swimming right at us. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=931.0s)]
*  At 60minutesovertime.com [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=933.0s)]
*  With extreme weather events on the rise across the globe, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=940.0s)]
*  like the rare Category 5 hurricane that hit Mexico in October, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=943.0s)]
*  we were interested in a study that's taking place on a remote island [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=947.0s)]
*  very few people are allowed to visit, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=951.0s)]
*  where scientists are studying how the stress of these environmental crises [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=954.0s)]
*  affect longevity and overall health. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=958.0s)]
*  As Leslie Stahl first reported in November, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=961.0s)]
*  the subjects are not what you'd expect. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=964.0s)]
*  They're monkeys, rhesus macaque monkeys, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=967.0s)]
*  who've been studied there for over 80 years [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=970.0s)]
*  because 94% of their DNA is the same as humans. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=973.0s)]
*  They survived with relative environmental stability [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=977.0s)]
*  until six years ago, when the island was hit with a devastating storm. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=980.0s)]
*  After taking tests for tuberculosis, measles and COVID, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=985.0s)]
*  Leslie and her team were allowed to visit the island, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=989.0s)]
*  called Cayo Santiago, or Monkey Island, off the coast of Puerto Rico. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=992.0s)]
*  There are roughly 1,800 monkeys on Cayo. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=999.0s)]
*  They live in isolation in what is a natural laboratory, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1003.0s)]
*  halfway between captivity and the way they would live in the wild. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1007.0s)]
*  Are they fighting? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1012.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1013.0s)]
*  She's looking around and screaming for help, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1014.0s)]
*  trying to get others to come to her aid. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1017.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1019.0s)]
*  Biologists James Hyam of NYU and Noah Snyder-Mackler of Arizona State University [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1020.0s)]
*  are part of a team of investigators in this long-term research project. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1027.0s)]
*  What's the lifespan usually? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1032.0s)]
*  The lifespan here on the island for the females, the median lifespan, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1034.0s)]
*  is about 18 years. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1038.0s)]
*  And then in males, about 15 years, right? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1040.0s)]
*  Is there a predator? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1043.0s)]
*  No predators here. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1045.0s)]
*  Another way life here is unlike the wild [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1049.0s)]
*  is that these guys serve their meals every morning. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1052.0s)]
*  Researchers tell us there's a hierarchy. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1056.0s)]
*  The highest-ranking monkeys get to eat first. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1062.0s)]
*  I've even seen high-ranking individuals go up to a lower-ranking individual [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1067.0s)]
*  who is eating food in their mouth and hold their mouth open [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1071.0s)]
*  and take the food out of their mouths and then... [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1075.0s)]
*  What do they get? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1078.0s)]
*  Purina monkey chow. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1080.0s)]
*  There's monkey chow? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1082.0s)]
*  Made by Purina. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1084.0s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1085.0s)]
*  Rhesus monkeys are commonly used for medical research [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1087.0s)]
*  because there are close relatives, genetically and physically, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1090.0s)]
*  similar to humans. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1094.0s)]
*  They have systems that are quite like us, eyes that are like us, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1099.0s)]
*  lungs and hearts that are like us. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1102.0s)]
*  These Rhesus macaque monkeys, their ancestors, came here from India in 1938. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1104.0s)]
*  The macaque is used in larger numbers for medical and zoological research [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1111.0s)]
*  than any other kind of primate. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1115.0s)]
*  American primatologist Clarence Carpenter took 500 of them [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1117.0s)]
*  on a grueling 14,000-mile sea voyage that lasted 51 days. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1122.0s)]
*  He wanted to create a naturalistic research facility [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1128.0s)]
*  to study the monkeys' social and sexual behaviors. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1132.0s)]
*  Their early years here were tough. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1136.0s)]
*  Many died from disease. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1138.0s)]
*  But enough of them lived on so that by the 1950s, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1140.0s)]
*  scientists began tattooing them and taking a daily census. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1144.0s)]
*  That meticulous record-keeping has continued with today's monkeys, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1152.0s)]
*  all of whom descended from the original group, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1156.0s)]
*  giving scientists rare access to more than six decades [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1160.0s)]
*  of their biological and behavioral data. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1164.0s)]
*  One of the things they learned is that they're highly adaptable, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1167.0s)]
*  acclimating quickly to the island. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1171.0s)]
*  They also learn that they can be quite aggressive, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1174.0s)]
*  especially around food and during the mating season. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1178.0s)]
*  Are these monkeys intelligent? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1182.0s)]
*  Sure. They're pretty intelligent. They're socially intelligent. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1185.0s)]
*  How similar to us are they and how they live? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1189.0s)]
*  They form really strong social relationships [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1192.0s)]
*  with their best friends and their family members. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1195.0s)]
*  They have best friends? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1198.0s)]
*  Some close friends, some best friends, right. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1200.0s)]
*  Rhesus monkeys live in female-led societies. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1202.0s)]
*  Mothers, daughters, aunts and grandmothers stick together in groups, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1206.0s)]
*  while the males leave when they reach maturity [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1211.0s)]
*  and join other troops for breeding. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1214.0s)]
*  Few people know the troop tensions and allegiances better [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1218.0s)]
*  than research assistants Daniel Phillips and Josue Negron, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1222.0s)]
*  who've worked on Caio for years. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1227.0s)]
*  They arrive every morning by boat at 7 a.m. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1230.0s)]
*  And for the next seven hours, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1234.0s)]
*  they document things like aggression, grooming, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1237.0s)]
*  vigilance and feeding. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1242.0s)]
*  Do you ever get to know individuals? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1244.0s)]
*  In other words, you know that monkey versus that one? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1247.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, we need to recognize them right away [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1251.0s)]
*  because I need to know who is interacting with who, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1255.0s)]
*  how they groom each other or attack each other. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1258.0s)]
*  And how can you tell the difference? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1263.0s)]
*  What are the characteristics that you see? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1265.0s)]
*  You can see the differences on even how they walk, how they move. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1268.0s)]
*  Their even faces have differences. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1272.0s)]
*  In other words, their faces become as ordinary in a way to your eyes, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1275.0s)]
*  as human faces. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1281.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1283.0s)]
*  You recognize even families. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1284.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1286.0s)]
*  Like, your face is familiar, you should be the son of this female. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1287.0s)]
*  Everything changed for the research and the monkeys [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1292.0s)]
*  when Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico in September 2017. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1296.0s)]
*  155 mile-an-hour winds smashed into homes and office buildings, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1304.0s)]
*  destroying everything in sight, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1310.0s)]
*  including the power grid and communication systems. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1313.0s)]
*  Nearly 3,000 people died. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1317.0s)]
*  There was no way for the team to get to Monkey Island. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1320.0s)]
*  Angelina Ruiz-Lambedes, the then scientific director of CAIO, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1324.0s)]
*  seven months pregnant at the time, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1329.0s)]
*  sheltered in her home outside of San Juan with her husband and two young children. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1332.0s)]
*  You thought the monkeys were all going to die? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1337.0s)]
*  Yeah, we thought that the monkeys were going to die. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1339.0s)]
*  James Hyam and Noah Snyder-Mackler couldn't get any news about their colleagues [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1342.0s)]
*  or the monkeys, so two days after the storm, the team came up with an idea. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1348.0s)]
*  And you hired a helicopter? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1354.0s)]
*  We hired a helicopter. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1355.0s)]
*  They enlisted the pilot to fly over CAIO and do a survey, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1357.0s)]
*  and they had a list of questions. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1361.0s)]
*  Can he see any monkeys? Are they alive? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1364.0s)]
*  What is the status of the vegetation? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1366.0s)]
*  Are there standing pools of water that they might be able to drink? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1369.0s)]
*  Angelina, who had decided to go up with the pilot, was horrified. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1373.0s)]
*  This is footage she shot from the helicopter. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1378.0s)]
*  I see this destruction, like 80 plus years of work completely flattened. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1382.0s)]
*  This is CAIO before the hurricane, with a dense canopy of trees and lush foliage. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1391.0s)]
*  This is after. A green oasis turned brown, buried in dead branches. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1398.0s)]
*  The island lost two-thirds of its vegetation. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1405.0s)]
*  Heartbroken by what she was seeing from the air, Angelina wanted a closer look. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1408.0s)]
*  But even on the ground, she didn't see any monkeys. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1414.0s)]
*  So then I get on the helicopter again. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1419.0s)]
*  Back up again. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1421.0s)]
*  And I need to look up there. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1422.0s)]
*  And that's when I see a social group running from the helicopter. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1425.0s)]
*  And I go, there's monkeys. They're still CAIO. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1429.0s)]
*  I think I estimated, OK, that must be around 300, 400 monkeys or so. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1434.0s)]
*  Out of 1,700? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1440.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1442.0s)]
*  But once the staff was able to return and do a complete census on the ground, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1444.0s)]
*  they found, to their utter astonishment, that most had lived. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1449.0s)]
*  They estimated just about 50 had died. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1455.0s)]
*  And you're thinking, how could they survive this? How could they? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1458.0s)]
*  How could they survive this? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1462.0s)]
*  It's still a mystery. What did the monkeys do to ride out the storm? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1465.0s)]
*  Where did they shelter from the wind? And what did they eat? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1470.0s)]
*  So one of the big questions is, without being fed, how were they nourished? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1474.0s)]
*  Yeah, so although the hurricane did dramatically de-vegetate the island, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1480.0s)]
*  one thing it also did was deposited a great amount of seaweed and algae onto the island. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1486.0s)]
*  And so one possibility is that the monkeys were eating more of this kind of vegetation. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1493.0s)]
*  Which they still seem to enjoy. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1498.0s)]
*  After the hurricane, the monkeys had to adjust to a new, far more hostile environment. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1501.0s)]
*  Their innate adaptability certainly helped. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1508.0s)]
*  So they bob up and down to try and stop themselves from falling forward. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1511.0s)]
*  Six years after the storm, the adjusting continues. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1515.0s)]
*  Attempts to replant the trees have been stymied because the monkeys, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1520.0s)]
*  ever curious about anything new in their environment, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1525.0s)]
*  uproot them before they have a chance to grow. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1529.0s)]
*  So now there's very little shade. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1532.0s)]
*  This used to be almost forested, right? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1536.0s)]
*  Lots of space and shade. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1539.0s)]
*  Now they're forced to sit in a few shaded areas, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1541.0s)]
*  so they've been clumped by the changing distribution of shade. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1544.0s)]
*  So an interesting thing that we saw is that individuals became more social. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1549.0s)]
*  Not just more social. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1555.0s)]
*  The researchers have noticed that the monkeys are more tolerant of each other, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1557.0s)]
*  which at first seemed counterintuitive. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1562.0s)]
*  I'm thinking of humans in a situation where there's fewer resources. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1565.0s)]
*  And I see in my mind's eye competition. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1570.0s)]
*  I see them saying, get off my property or whatever. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1573.0s)]
*  You're saying that it was the opposite here. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1576.0s)]
*  Perhaps, but there's also famous examples of people pulling together. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1579.0s)]
*  So I think it can go both ways. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1583.0s)]
*  We're capable of great greed and competition and cruelty, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1586.0s)]
*  but humans are also capable of great kindness and compassion and friendship and generosity. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1592.0s)]
*  And that kind of duality exists in Rhesus-Mercat societies too. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1598.0s)]
*  And I think anyone you talk to here in Puerto Rico would bring up the fact that [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1603.0s)]
*  the people of Puerto Rico sort of gelled and increased their support of one another in the face of this event. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1607.0s)]
*  Beyond observing their social interactions, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1613.0s)]
*  they were also able to track biological changes since they had access to blood tests done on the monkeys for 13 years. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1616.0s)]
*  So what we found is that individuals who had lived through the hurricane [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1625.0s)]
*  had immune systems that looked like they had aged an extra two years. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1629.0s)]
*  What is that in human years? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1634.0s)]
*  It's six to eight human years. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1636.0s)]
*  They aged six to eight years? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1638.0s)]
*  They aged six to eight human years. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1641.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1643.0s)]
*  Through the trauma. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1645.0s)]
*  That was on average. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1646.0s)]
*  That's the work that we're trying to do right now is what makes some of these individuals more resilient to the hurricane, right? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1647.0s)]
*  Is the hypothesis that it has something to do with friendships? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1655.0s)]
*  We think that those individuals who were able to have stronger bonds, stronger friendships, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1659.0s)]
*  might have been protected from this really stressful event. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1665.0s)]
*  The hurricane opened all new avenues of their research, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1669.0s)]
*  with questions such as what predicts who survives a catastrophe like an earthquake or a hurricane, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1674.0s)]
*  and how quickly they recover. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1681.0s)]
*  So when you step back and look at your study in terms of climate-related trauma or any kind of trauma, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1685.0s)]
*  are you expecting to find answers for survivability in these situations for human beings? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1694.0s)]
*  Given the strong similarity between these primates, these monkeys, and us, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1702.0s)]
*  we know that a lot of the work that we're doing and the things that they might do to be more resilient to this [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1707.0s)]
*  might be translatable to humans, to us, and might provide ways for us to intervene [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1715.0s)]
*  and help buffer against the negative effects of these traumatic events. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1721.0s)]
*  The stopwatch has long been the symbol of 60 minutes, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1738.0s)]
*  but any measure of time is pointless for the subject of our next story, the slow-moving sloth. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1742.0s)]
*  You might think these distant relatives of the armadillo would make the perfect meal for just about anything faster. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1748.0s)]
*  And yet somehow sloths have been hanging on in one form or another for 64 million years. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1755.0s)]
*  To understand this quirky animal, 60 minutes hung out with a quirky zoologist. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1762.0s)]
*  Lucy Cook has been documenting the strange lives of sloths for 15 years. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1767.0s)]
*  Cook was Sharon Alfonsi's guide on a trip to Costa Rica, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1773.0s)]
*  where as we first reported in September, scientists are making new discoveries [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1776.0s)]
*  about a creature that's turned survival of the fittest upside down. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1781.0s)]
*  This is an area where there are lots of sloths, so we have that on our side. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1786.0s)]
*  The first thing we learned about sloths is that it's hard to spot them in the wild. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1791.0s)]
*  We were warned to keep our eyes on the ground for poisonous snakes, as Lucy Cook scanned the treetops. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1796.0s)]
*  The sloth is a master of disguise. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1802.0s)]
*  It blends into the canopy and can easily be mistaken for a tuft of leaves. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1805.0s)]
*  They tend to hunker down when it rains, so making it even harder to see them. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1810.0s)]
*  Our luck improved on the beach. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1816.0s)]
*  Oh, there's one up there! [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1819.0s)]
*  She's in the nook of the tree looking a bit like a termite hump, and she's hunched over, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1821.0s)]
*  so what we're looking at is her back. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1826.0s)]
*  That is not the side of the sloth we went all the way to Central America to see. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1829.0s)]
*  So Lucy Cook took us to an animal sanctuary to get a better view of the two species of sloth that live here, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1834.0s)]
*  the bratipus and the two-toed. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1841.0s)]
*  So the two-toed I always say look like a cross between a wookie and a pig, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1843.0s)]
*  so they've got that sort of beepable nose, and then these ones have the sort of, you know, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1847.0s)]
*  beetles, haircuts and Mona Lisa smiles. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1851.0s)]
*  Behind that ringer for Ringo, Cook says, is a secret. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1855.0s)]
*  Being nature's couch potato is the reason sloths have survived for more than 60 million years, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1859.0s)]
*  in spite of, well, themselves. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1865.0s)]
*  Their eyesight is lousy, their hearing not much better. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1868.0s)]
*  In a tree, they can move like a Tai Chi master to avoid the eyes of hungry birds of prey, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1872.0s)]
*  but on the ground, Cook says gravity removes any shred of dignity. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1878.0s)]
*  Even with a hurricane strength tailwind, a sloth will top out at a half mile per hour. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1884.0s)]
*  The first people that described the sloths, the conquistadors that first observed them, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1890.0s)]
*  they said terrible things. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1894.0s)]
*  One said it was the stupidest animal that he'd ever seen, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1896.0s)]
*  and another said one more defect would have made its life impossible, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1898.0s)]
*  and they just didn't understand them, you know. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1902.0s)]
*  Cook says what those early explorers didn't understand, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1906.0s)]
*  and what is frankly hard to believe when you watch the effort it takes for a sloth just to blink, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1910.0s)]
*  is that this hairy ninja is uniquely built to survive. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1916.0s)]
*  Why so slow? Why do they move so slow? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1921.0s)]
*  Because they're saving energy. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1923.0s)]
*  They're vegetarians, and leaves don't want to be eaten any more than antelope do, right? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1925.0s)]
*  So they create a lot of toxins. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1930.0s)]
*  So the sloth can digest those toxins, but only very, very slowly. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1932.0s)]
*  They don't want to process them fast, and so they're all about burning as little energy as possible. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1937.0s)]
*  Sloths spend about 90% of their lives hanging upside down, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1943.0s)]
*  and typically only climb to the ground for bathroom breaks once a week. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1947.0s)]
*  With habits like that and nails like this, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1952.0s)]
*  you can understand why they are solitary creatures and prefer to be alone until they don't. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1955.0s)]
*  What they do is the females will climb to the top of a tree when they're in heat and scream for sex. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1961.0s)]
*  Really low key. Really low key. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1968.0s)]
*  But they scream in D sharp. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1972.0s)]
*  Like that's the... they make this... I mean, I'll do it, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1974.0s)]
*  and he may well, on the strength of my impersonation, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1977.0s)]
*  let's see if Teddy, who's a boy, who's twice-raised, exactly, let's just see if he goes, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1980.0s)]
*  OK, I'm going to... [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1985.0s)]
*  Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1986.0s)]
*  I've actually seen bradipusses having sex. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1993.0s)]
*  It's the only thing they do quickly. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1996.0s)]
*  I mean, I was shocked. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=1998.0s)]
*  But then afterwards, both male and female are treated and had the deepest snooze. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2000.0s)]
*  Behind Lucy Cook's cheeky sense of humor is a hefty resume. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2007.0s)]
*  She has a master's degree from Oxford and published four books, including two on Sloths. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2012.0s)]
*  She's also hosted wildlife programs for the BBC and National Geographic. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2018.0s)]
*  The photos Cook takes on her expeditions have gone viral, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2023.0s)]
*  leading to donations for conservation and crowds at lectures that mix biology with stand-up. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2027.0s)]
*  We humans are obsessed with speed. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2034.0s)]
*  We idolize animals like the cheetah, capable of doing 0-60 in three seconds flat. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2038.0s)]
*  Well, so what? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2045.0s)]
*  Are they cute or are they so ugly they're cute? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2050.0s)]
*  Oh, no, they're cute, surely. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2052.0s)]
*  But then, I mean, I think a naked mole rat's cute, so you're asking the wrong person. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2055.0s)]
*  You're like a beetle-est animal. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2059.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2061.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a whole list of animals that I think just have extraordinarily strange and wonderful lives [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2062.0s)]
*  and just to me, just add to the richness of the universe. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2070.0s)]
*  Just look how one of those B-list animals can leave Lucy Cook starstruck. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2076.0s)]
*  You guys have got to see this! [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2082.0s)]
*  As we were making our way through the Costa Rican rainforest, Cook noticed this. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2084.0s)]
*  What looks like fluffy golf balls, she realized, was a cluster of something we'd never heard of. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2089.0s)]
*  Come and have a look, show her, show her. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2095.0s)]
*  The elusive Caribbean white tent-making bats. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2097.0s)]
*  Look, they're bats, but they're white and they live in these leaves. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2100.0s)]
*  My heart rate's gone right up, I'm going to start pouring in sweat and I might start crying, actually, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2105.0s)]
*  because it's just so, I mean, it's just a miracle of evolution. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2110.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just why, like why? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2113.0s)]
*  That sense of wonder. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2115.0s)]
*  That's about as exciting as it gets. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2117.0s)]
*  Has made Lucy Cook a compelling advocate for sloths. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2119.0s)]
*  Like them, she looks at the world from a different point of view. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2123.0s)]
*  Your latest book is called? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2127.0s)]
*  Bitch. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2129.0s)]
*  Do apologize. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2130.0s)]
*  I really like you and your work, but yeah, my book's called Bitch. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2133.0s)]
*  In it, Cook challenges the narrative that in the animal kingdom, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2137.0s)]
*  males are usually dominant and promiscuous, while females are submissive and monogamous. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2141.0s)]
*  She traveled the world to collaborate with scientists and study dozens of animals, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2147.0s)]
*  reporting how killer whale pods are led by post-menopausal orcas [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2153.0s)]
*  and how tyrannical matriarchs control meerkat society. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2158.0s)]
*  Her reexamination flips parts of Charles Darwin's theories upside down. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2162.0s)]
*  Charles Darwin's a hero of mine. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2167.0s)]
*  I studied evolutionary biology, but he was a Victorian man. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2169.0s)]
*  And so when he came to brand the female of the species, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2173.0s)]
*  she came out in the shape of a Victorian housewife. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2178.0s)]
*  Passive, coy, chaste. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2181.0s)]
*  You know, we were sort of a feminine footnote to the macho main event, basically. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2184.0s)]
*  I can hear people saying, is this biological whopeness? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2190.0s)]
*  Well, it would be if it wasn't true. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2194.0s)]
*  You just have to ask the hyena, for example, the female spotted hyena, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2197.0s)]
*  if she's passive and coy, and she'll laugh in your face after she's bitten it off. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2201.0s)]
*  It's like... [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2205.0s)]
*  Challenging conventional wisdom is a large part of Lucy Cook's crusade [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2206.0s)]
*  to improve the reputation of sloths. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2210.0s)]
*  But there is a more somber kind of rehabilitation she wanted to show us. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2213.0s)]
*  This is the Toucan Rescue Ranch near Costa Rica's capital, San Jose. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2218.0s)]
*  So sloths are incredibly strong. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2223.0s)]
*  They're for sloths nearly killed by power lines. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2226.0s)]
*  How are the sloths injured? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2229.0s)]
*  So most of the time it's through electrocution, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2231.0s)]
*  where it'll just look like this straight vine going through the forest, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2233.0s)]
*  and so they'll grab a hold of that and then become electrocuted. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2237.0s)]
*  Leslie Howe was an occupational therapist who started the ranch 19 years ago. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2240.0s)]
*  Now she has a team of six veterinarians to treat the electrical burns. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2245.0s)]
*  Millions of years of evolution could not prepare the sloths for human sprawl. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2249.0s)]
*  But the vets told us they believe the sloth's slow metabolism [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2254.0s)]
*  somehow allows them to recover from injuries that might kill other creatures. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2258.0s)]
*  The Toucan Rescue Ranch also takes in orphans. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2263.0s)]
*  This is little Gio, and this is Marilyn. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2267.0s)]
*  And then we have Landon here. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2271.0s)]
*  Oh, he's a toddler? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2273.0s)]
*  He's a toddler. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2274.0s)]
*  And this is our tiniest little Benji. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2275.0s)]
*  Okay, now my ovaries have cracked. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2278.0s)]
*  It can take up to two years for the orphans to be ready to go back into the wild. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2280.0s)]
*  We watched as a female named Nassara was prepared for release. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2286.0s)]
*  She was given a final checkup and a tracking collar [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2292.0s)]
*  before getting a lift to a promising tree. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2295.0s)]
*  Off she goes. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2299.0s)]
*  And if she falls asleep in the middle of the release. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2301.0s)]
*  Is that a bad thing? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2305.0s)]
*  There she goes. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2308.0s)]
*  Oh, it's a scary moment. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2310.0s)]
*  Mission Impossible has nothing on this. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2314.0s)]
*  With that high drama behind us, we headed down the Caribbean coast with Lucy Cook [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2317.0s)]
*  to visit another British scientist. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2324.0s)]
*  Becky Cliff is conducting the first population study of sloths ever. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2327.0s)]
*  That might seem like low-hanging fruit. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2332.0s)]
*  It is not. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2335.0s)]
*  Why is it so hard to get scientific data on sloths? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2336.0s)]
*  They've evolved over the last 64 million years to be masters of disguise, right? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2340.0s)]
*  They are so good at pretending to be coconuts and bird nests, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2345.0s)]
*  then they're hiding from the very people who are trying to help them. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2349.0s)]
*  Neither of the sloth species in Costa Rica is officially considered endangered. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2353.0s)]
*  But Cliff says her staff is suddenly seeing fewer sloths. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2358.0s)]
*  And some are suffering from an illness she suspects of being a disease. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2361.0s)]
*  She suspects may be related to climate change. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2365.0s)]
*  We're getting extreme periods of hot, dry weather, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2368.0s)]
*  and then extreme periods of prolonged cold and rain. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2372.0s)]
*  And that is not what sloths have evolved to survive in. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2376.0s)]
*  What we're discovering is that the microbes in the sloth's stomach [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2379.0s)]
*  that they use to digest the leaves they eat, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2383.0s)]
*  when the sloth gets too cold, those microbes die. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2385.0s)]
*  So even though the sloth might be eating and looking well, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2388.0s)]
*  it's not digesting its food properly. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2392.0s)]
*  So they're losing energy and they're getting very weak. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2394.0s)]
*  It sounds like they're starving to death, but with a full stomach. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2397.0s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2400.0s)]
*  It's a really strange phenomenon that I think only happens in sloths, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2401.0s)]
*  but it's happening here. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2405.0s)]
*  For Cliff to collect data, she has to collect sloths. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2407.0s)]
*  Which branch is she? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2411.0s)]
*  That's the full-time job for her colleague, Debar Leon. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2413.0s)]
*  He climbed barefoot up a three-story high tree, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2417.0s)]
*  covered in biting ants, snatching the sloth, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2420.0s)]
*  then lowering it in a bag. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2423.0s)]
*  Come on, little one, high. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2425.0s)]
*  That's impressive. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2427.0s)]
*  So do you have to do that every time you want to get a sloth down? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2428.0s)]
*  This is easy. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2431.0s)]
*  The stuffed sloth she's holding is not a gimmick. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2433.0s)]
*  It was used to comfort the real one, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2436.0s)]
*  as we helped replace a memory chip in a tiny backpack the sloth wears. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2438.0s)]
*  You're very strong. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2443.0s)]
*  Very strong. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2444.0s)]
*  And then lean her back a little bit. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2445.0s)]
*  Come on, sweetie. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2447.0s)]
*  I'm going to clip those little things up. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2451.0s)]
*  This is like dressing a baby. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2453.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2455.0s)]
*  Done. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2456.0s)]
*  Wham-bam. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2457.0s)]
*  What kind of information does this give you? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2458.0s)]
*  We collect a lot of manual data in terms of what type of tree she's in, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2461.0s)]
*  how high in the tree she is. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2465.0s)]
*  There's also a data logger inside here, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2467.0s)]
*  which collects a lot of information about her behavior. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2469.0s)]
*  So even her micro body movements are being recorded inside there. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2472.0s)]
*  There we go. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2477.0s)]
*  There we go. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2478.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a girl. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2479.0s)]
*  32 sloths will get backpacks and be returned slowly to the wild. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2481.0s)]
*  Lucy Cook told us she hopes this study will provide a deeper understanding [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2486.0s)]
*  of an animal we can be too quick to judge. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2491.0s)]
*  What can we learn from this sloth? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2494.0s)]
*  We can learn how to be more slow and sustainable ourselves, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2496.0s)]
*  because we need to. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2500.0s)]
*  We're destroying this planet at an alarming rate, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2503.0s)]
*  and part of that is because of our addiction to speed and convenience. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2507.0s)]
*  So if we took a few carefully, slowly digested leaves out of the sloth's book, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2511.0s)]
*  you know, we might save this beautiful planet [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2518.0s)]
*  and all of the amazing creatures that live on it. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2521.0s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyD2YJHhlc&t=2533.0s)]
