**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A)
*  When workers broke ground on an underground parking lot in the heart of Rome 15 years [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=0.0s)]
*  ago, they had no idea what their backhoes were about to unearth. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=16.56s)]
*  The site turned out to be what Italian archaeologists believe was once the pleasure gardens of the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=21.12s)]
*  Caligula, where some 2000 years ago all sorts of lavish parties, royal intrigue, and debauched [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=26.8s)]
*  behavior likely took place. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=32.8s)]
*  Caligula became the third emperor of Rome in 37 AD, and he reigned for barely four years. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=35.64s)]
*  He's been portrayed in history as one of the most deranged and despicable Roman emperors [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  ever to rule, but for years scholars have been re-examining parts of Caligula's story [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=46.24s)]
*  to see if history has it right. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=51.84s)]
*  Could we discover some new fragments of truth in Caligula's gardens? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=54.48s)]
*  We were more than happy to go to Rome to find out. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=58.72s)]
*  The temples and palaces of ancient Rome may have crumbled long ago, but the legend of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=63.12s)]
*  one of its oddest emperors lives on. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=67.32s)]
*  What most people know about Caligula comes from this iconic BBC series, I, Claudius, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=75.32s)]
*  which was based on two historical novels by Robert Graves. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=80.68s)]
*  In the show, Caligula turns his palace into a brothel, makes his horse a high-ranking [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=85.44s)]
*  senator and declares himself a living god. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=91.04s)]
*  It's a torrid tale of incest, infanticide, and imperial madness. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=99.12s)]
*  But how much of that portrayal is real? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=109.84s)]
*  Did Caligula impregnate his sister and then eat her baby? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=112.72s)]
*  Did not impregnate his sister and eat her baby. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  Did Caligula make a horse a high-ranking senator or consul? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=121.0s)]
*  No, no, of course he didn't. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  Did he turn his palace into a brothel? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=126.26s)]
*  No. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=128.52s)]
*  No. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=129.52s)]
*  So where did all these ideas come from? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=130.52s)]
*  Well, largely from Robert Graves. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=132.12s)]
*  You know, his I, Claudius novels are awesome, but he wasn't an academic. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=135.04s)]
*  He was a writer. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  Andrew Wallace Hadrill is an academic, a professor emeritus at the University of Cambridge, and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  he's closely studied the few written accounts that survived from Caligula's time. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  I grew up watching I, Claudius. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=153.16s)]
*  I love the book. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=154.88s)]
*  I love the old TV series. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=155.88s)]
*  You're telling me a lot of that just wasn't true. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  What I'm not denying is they had sex in the palace. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=161.04s)]
*  Of course they had sex. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  Pretty spectacularly, of course they had sex. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  Spectacularly? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=170.56s)]
*  But Wallace Hadrill does believe Caligula could be very impulsive and brutal, and he [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=171.56s)]
*  doesn't rule out the possibility that he may have had a severe physical or mental disorder. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  I think there's a serious danger that Caligula was pathological, that he actually didn't [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=181.64s)]
*  care about the hurt he caused. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=189.0s)]
*  Wallace Hadrill says Robert Graves' novels were largely based on stories published around [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=192.04s)]
*  121 AD, 80 years after Caligula's death, by Suetonius, a well-known biographer and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=196.6s)]
*  advisor to later emperors. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=203.04s)]
*  But Suetonius often had to rely on secondhand stories and gossip from members of the imperial [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=205.36s)]
*  court. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=210.52s)]
*  These members of the court, it's like staffers in the White House. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=211.52s)]
*  It's like all those leaky people in Buckingham Palace. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=216.6s)]
*  What are these stories worth? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  How can you pin them down? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=221.88s)]
*  Archaeology can help pin down the past, but in a city full of amazing ruins, not much [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=224.72s)]
*  directly linked to Caligula had been discovered. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=229.88s)]
*  That is until 2006, when a pension fund for Italian doctors called NPAM started digging [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=233.2s)]
*  an underground parking garage for its new office building in the Esquilino neighborhood [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  of Rome. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=244.84s)]
*  In ancient times, this was one of a number of tranquil garden estates, located about [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=246.56s)]
*  ten minutes by carriage from the bustling Roman Forum. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=251.48s)]
*  These recreations from Rome's superintendent of antiquities give some sense of the sprawling [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=255.32s)]
*  grounds and buildings enjoyed by emperors and their guests for about four centuries. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=260.4s)]
*  It took archaeologists nine years to carefully recover more than a million pieces of the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=266.42s)]
*  while an underground parking garage and modern building was built around them. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=272.28s)]
*  Everything found was taken to a large warehouse where it was closely analyzed, logged into [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=277.32s)]
*  a database and, when possible, painstakingly restored. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=282.2s)]
*  The office building's completed now and last month, Rome's newest archaeological site, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  the Nymphaeum Museum, opened in the basement, preserving some of the excavation and suggesting [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=291.82s)]
*  what a lush and lavish place this once was. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=298.04s)]
*  It contains thousands of items from the second century B.C. through the fifth century A.D., [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=301.54s)]
*  like this drinking glass that somehow survived largely intact for 1,900 years. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=306.88s)]
*  Morella Sir Lorenzi, director of excavations for the Italian Ministry of Culture, took [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  us to a small staircase normally closed to the public and brought us to the level of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  the ground during Caligula's time. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=322.72s)]
*  And so back then, in the first century, 2,000 years ago, this was outside. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=325.36s)]
*  It was clearly a garden because we found in the layers traces of the roots of the plants [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=333.44s)]
*  and in this part here the staircase connected the various levels of the garden. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=338.76s)]
*  Is it possible to walk on it? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=344.68s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=348.0s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=349.0s)]
*  This is what Sir Lorenzi's team believes the area looked like during Caligula's reign. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=350.96s)]
*  We ended up talking for a long time on the garden steps. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=355.92s)]
*  Is it right to sit down? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=360.44s)]
*  Si, ok. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=362.0s)]
*  There was something about touching those old slabs of marble that made ancient history [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=363.0s)]
*  feel very real. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=367.52s)]
*  I can't believe that we are sitting on the steps that Caligula may have walked on. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=369.32s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=374.2s)]
*  She told us the water pipe by our feet was installed by Caligula's successor, his uncle [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=375.8s)]
*  Claudius. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  His name is stamped on the pipe. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=381.40000000000003s)]
*  One of the most remarkable things about Caligula is that he lived to become emperor at all. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  The emperor before him, his adoptive grandfather Tiberius, was suspected of killing Caligula's [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=388.6s)]
*  father, mother and two brothers. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=393.96000000000004s)]
*  And when Caligula turned 19, he was summoned to live with Tiberius at his palace on the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=396.44s)]
*  island of Capri. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=401.52s)]
*  It sits high on a cliff and it's said Tiberius would have people who crossed him tossed [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=403.76s)]
*  onto the rocks below. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=408.44s)]
*  Through some combination of flattery and deceit, Caligula managed to survive here for six years [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=410.52s)]
*  with a man who may have killed much of his family. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=416.08s)]
*  He became Tiberius's successor in 37 AD. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=419.4s)]
*  He was just 24 years old and in charge of an empire. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=423.08s)]
*  He was in a very, very difficult position. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=426.8s)]
*  I like the saying of Tiberius who says being emperor is like having to hold a wolf by the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=430.0s)]
*  ears. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=437.8s)]
*  There's this savage beast that can turn on you any moment. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=438.8s)]
*  What is so insecure about it? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=445.04s)]
*  Was it the system itself? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=446.84s)]
*  You've got this enormous concentration of power and resource, wealth, concentrated [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=448.56s)]
*  on the palace in Rome. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=454.88s)]
*  And everyone wants in on it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=457.68s)]
*  Are they prepared to do anything to seize this power? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=459.84s)]
*  Back then, the Roman Empire dominated the Mediterranean world and items found in the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=464.0s)]
*  gardens give some sense of the riches that flowed towards Rome. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=468.52s)]
*  Rare and intricately carved marble from the far reaches of the empire decorated the walls [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=473.32s)]
*  of the buildings. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=477.44s)]
*  Glass recovered at the site appears to have been used in very early windows and large [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=479.08s)]
*  amounts of oysters appear to have been served at meals. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=483.0s)]
*  Morellista Lorenzi says her team recovered the bones of wild animals that would have [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=486.72s)]
*  been brought here from faraway lands. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=490.36s)]
*  She showed us the leg of an ostrich, the foot of a lion and the tooth of a bear. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=492.8s)]
*  It's evident that wild animals were here for the entertainment of the emperor. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=499.2s)]
*  Games were carried out here with gladiators, we can imagine, and battles with ferocious [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  beasts. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=507.72s)]
*  When he became emperor, Caligula started improving Rome's infrastructure. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=508.72s)]
*  He began work on new aqueducts. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=513.76s)]
*  He also cut taxes. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=516.06s)]
*  Sir Lorenzi says this coin found in the gardens was minted around 39 A.D. to remind Romans [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=517.98s)]
*  that Caligula got rid of a sales tax. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=523.86s)]
*  Two thousand years ago, politicians were just like politicians today. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=526.3s)]
*  If they cut taxes, they wanted everybody to know about it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=531.8199999999999s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=535.5799999999999s)]
*  The coins are a form of imperial propaganda. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=536.74s)]
*  But something changed as the years progressed. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=540.42s)]
*  Suetonius says Caligula wanted to be treated as a god and connected his palace in the Roman [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=542.9399999999999s)]
*  Forum to a major temple. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=548.02s)]
*  That's the Temple of Castor and Paul? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=550.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=551.8199999999999s)]
*  And this column has been standing there for more than two thousand years. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=552.8199999999999s)]
*  They have been created in year six. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=556.8199999999999s)]
*  Paolo Caraffa, professor of archaeology at Sapienza University of Rome, has been studying [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=559.02s)]
*  the Roman Forum area for more than 35 years. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=564.14s)]
*  So according to Suetonius, Caligula extended his house up to that temple. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=567.6999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=574.06s)]
*  Is that, have you found evidence of that? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=575.06s)]
*  Behind that temple, recent excavations have identified fragments of a large house, a luxury [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=577.1s)]
*  house. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=583.2199999999999s)]
*  He can't say for sure it was Caligula's house, but he says it comes from that time period. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=584.38s)]
*  And only an emperor like Caligula would have dared do something so shocking. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=589.14s)]
*  He wanted the temple to be the entrance to his own house. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=593.38s)]
*  Which is quite unusual. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=597.38s)]
*  One of the things I, Claudia, seems to have gotten right, Wallace Hadrill told us, was [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=599.86s)]
*  Caligula's capacity for both physical and mental cruelty. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=603.86s)]
*  There's no doubt that Caligula's brutal. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=607.98s)]
*  But Suetonius says he's not only brutal, he thinks it's amusing. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=612.3s)]
*  He takes pleasure in it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=617.46s)]
*  Perhaps the most telling account comes from a contemporary of Caligula's, the philosopher [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=618.66s)]
*  who describes how Caligula invited a father to a festive dinner on the day he'd executed [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=623.9799999999999s)]
*  the man's son. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=629.0999999999999s)]
*  And at the dinner, he insists that the father should have a jolly time. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=630.6999999999999s)]
*  He plies him with wine and food. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=638.26s)]
*  He even plies him with perfume and a garland. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=640.66s)]
*  On the very day his son... [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=643.9399999999999s)]
*  On the very day. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=645.2199999999999s)]
*  And Seneca says, people asked, how on earth could he endure to do it? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=646.8199999999999s)]
*  And the answer is, he had a second son. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=651.62s)]
*  And I think that anecdote just evokes the atmosphere of terror of the court of Caligula. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=655.86s)]
*  As I, Claudia, showed, the end came in 41 A.D. when Caligula was stabbed to death by members [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=663.86s)]
*  of his own imperial guard. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=669.88s)]
*  He's killed by his own guardsman, but then they haven't got a candidate. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=672.22s)]
*  They don't have somebody waiting to take over. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=679.74s)]
*  There's no one in the wings except poor old Claudius. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=681.74s)]
*  Does that argue the point that he had to have been really awful if they were so motivated [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=685.3399999999999s)]
*  to just kill him? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=691.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=692.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=693.06s)]
*  It's an assassination born of anger, humiliation, disgust. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=694.06s)]
*  We can't take this anymore. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=702.42s)]
*  Long after the assassination itself, some historians believe Caligula's enemies assassinated [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=704.9s)]
*  his memory as well. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=710.38s)]
*  There's a number of contemporary scholars who've argued that Caligula's critics distorted [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=712.38s)]
*  his memory, that they have falsely made him out to be far worse than he was. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=717.04s)]
*  Of course. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=722.76s)]
*  It's like entering a hall of mirrors, and you know some of them are concave and some [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=723.76s)]
*  are convex, and there are no flat mirrors. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=727.28s)]
*  But isn't that terrifying that what we think we know about history is so dependent on [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=731.28s)]
*  rumors or... [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=739.6s)]
*  Well, I think it's an enormous mistake to look at the past as a series of solid rocks [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=740.6s)]
*  that are, you know, that was definitely there and that was definitely... [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=747.0s)]
*  It's a great morass, a flowing sea. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=752.62s)]
*  I think that ancient history is very good for people because it's got so much uncertainty [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=755.34s)]
*  in it. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=761.26s)]
*  But why is it good that there's a lot of misinformation? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=762.26s)]
*  It's good because the world we live in is full of misinformation, as we have learned [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=766.84s)]
*  spectacularly in recent years, you know. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=771.8000000000001s)]
*  People invent truths. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=775.02s)]
*  You have to be skeptical. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=776.5600000000001s)]
*  As we prepare to leave the Nymphaeum Museum, we couldn't help thinking about how time tramples [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=778.46s)]
*  even the mightiest of empires, turning lavish gardens into underground parking lots. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=783.24s)]
*  What do you think Caligula would think of what's happened to his gardens? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=788.96s)]
*  I think he'd be in total disagreement. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=794.1s)]
*  And I don't think he'd be very happy that we're sitting on his staircase. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=797.14s)]
*  Okay, name that country. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=803.82s)]

*  It's a monarchy that features its own currency, postage stamps, constitution, national anthem, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=815.3199999999999s)]

*  rogues, and offshore internet schemes. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=846.58s)]

*  Nice TV. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=987.9599999999999s)]
*  Our claustrophobic tour continued downward. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=989.28s)]

*  Like many countries, there's a national cathedral. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1002.28s)]
*  Freedom of worship in sea land. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1005.8199999999999s)]
*  I think there's even the Quran here somewhere. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1007.5s)]
*  On the bottom floor, the jail. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1010.54s)]
*  Two days in the brig, bread and water. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1013.02s)]
*  I have to look at the sea land constitution and see what my rights are. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1015.1s)]

*  This is Radio Carolina on 199. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1028.18s)]
*  Back in the 1960s, these same waters played host to the burgeoning, unlicensed commercial [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1030.28s)]
*  radio business that operated on ships and old fords, what the British government called [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1035.8s)]
*  pirate radio. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1041.36s)]
*  It was the time of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, but the stodgy BBC, which [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1044.36s)]
*  had a monopoly on broadcasting in Britain, gave the rock bands just an hour of airtime [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1050.36s)]
*  a week. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1055.82s)]
*  The younger set in Britain, millions of them, tuned their radio knobs to the pirate stations. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1060.8s)]
*  In 1965, Prince Michael's father, Roy Bates, an enterprising swashbuckling World War II [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1066.56s)]
*  veteran, commandeered a fort where another pirate station operated. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1072.76s)]
*  It was the Wild West on the North Sea. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1077.4s)]
*  The DJs may not be highly experienced, but they certainly pull their weight. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1080.48s)]
*  Bates set up Britain's first 24-hour outfit. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1084.76s)]
*  He called it Radio Essex. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1088.0s)]
*  Radio Essex broadcasting on 22 meters. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1089.92s)]
*  We're doing a job that's needed. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1093.38s)]
*  The public wants us to do the job, so do businesses. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1094.66s)]
*  And I think while this demand is here, we'll remain in business. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1098.18s)]
*  But not for long. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1101.38s)]
*  The British government enacted a new law rendering all pirate radio stations illegal. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1102.8200000000002s)]
*  Bates was forced to shut down, but true to his nature, he was something other than scared [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1108.22s)]
*  off. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1113.66s)]
*  It just would not back down. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1114.66s)]
*  Form of surrender, if he had said, you know what, I'm out. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1116.9s)]
*  He wouldn't know that word surrender. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1119.5s)]
*  I mean, no. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1121.2s)]
*  Far from surrendering, Bates seized another fort, Ruff's Tower, which was outside UK [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1122.92s)]
*  territorial waters. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1128.8s)]
*  Instead of restarting Radio Essex, he did something bolder still. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1130.8s)]
*  On September 2, 1967, he declared it an independent state, sea land, and declared himself its [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1135.2s)]
*  prince. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1142.76s)]
*  It was his wife Joan's birthday. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1144.0s)]
*  And it was, of course, a hugely romantic gesture to make my mother a princess. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1146.72s)]
*  In addition to taking you out to dinner, I'm going to make you a princess. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1150.7s)]
*  He didn't take her out to dinner, but he just made her a princess, yeah. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1154.3s)]
*  Prince Roy and Princess Joan, along with their two children, Michael and Penny, set up home [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1158.18s)]
*  on sea land. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1162.98s)]
*  The sheer novelty of their lifestyle was a constant source of amusement on the mainland. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1164.5s)]
*  This newsreel is from 1969. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1169.5s)]
*  The start of another day, even for the new royals, is no different than for millions [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1171.98s)]
*  of others. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1175.76s)]
*  The request for a common cuppa. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1176.76s)]
*  Mrs. Bates, how is it possible to keep looking glamorous in conditions like these? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1178.96s)]
*  It's no more difficult than anywhere else in the world. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1184.76s)]
*  We're quite comfortable here. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1187.24s)]
*  We have all the things I want. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1188.56s)]
*  Look, make-ups, brushes, and things. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1190.44s)]
*  At age 16, Penny was less convinced. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1192.96s)]
*  It was freezing cold, and it had no electricity. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1195.92s)]
*  To flush the toilet, you'd have to chuck a bucket over the side, drop it down about 80 [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1199.52s)]
*  feet, pull it up, and flush the toilet. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1203.68s)]
*  That was your toilet. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1205.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1206.36s)]
*  The Bates family had big ambitions to turn sea land into a tax haven, a luxury island, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1207.36s)]
*  and casino. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1213.02s)]
*  And they went all in on the trappings of statehood, fashioning a flag, stamps, currency, an anthem, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1214.02s)]
*  even a national motto, Imare libertas, from the sea of freedom. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1222.2199999999998s)]
*  As teens, Michael and Penny would spend months on sea land, holding down the fort, as it [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1230.98s)]
*  were, firing off warning shots and tossing Molotov cocktails overboard to fend off periodic [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1235.64s)]
*  attempts of invasion from rivals and buccaneers. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1241.54s)]
*  When the press eventually came out and took photographs, my father called me down and [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1245.1s)]
*  he said, now look, he said, how many times have I told you, you do not hold a gun like [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1249.64s)]
*  that? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1256.26s)]
*  You weren't holding the gun the right way. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1257.26s)]
*  And actually, if you look at the picture, the way I'm holding the guns is dreadful. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1258.54s)]
*  Firmly settled on sea land, the Bateses remained a nuisance to the British government. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1262.74s)]
*  So much so, as a warning to the family, a team of royal engineers blew up a similar [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1268.02s)]
*  North Sea fort. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1273.58s)]
*  At sea land's National Archives, which doubles as Prince Michael's dining room table, we [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1278.3799999999999s)]
*  were shown declassified plans drawn up by the British Ministry of Defense to take sea [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1283.8999999999999s)]

*  Royal Navy, two Wessex 5 helicopters, crafts from HM naval base Chatham, Portsmouth, Medway [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1295.8999999999999s)]
*  and a clearance diving team. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1302.86s)]
*  It's crazy, isn't it? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1305.06s)]
*  But it wasn't just the British government that wanted to dislodge the family. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1307.1399999999999s)]
*  In August 1978, a band of rogue German and Dutch lawyers and diamond merchants launched [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1311.74s)]
*  a coup d'etat with designs of founding their own offshore casino. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1317.3400000000001s)]
*  They arrived by helicopter with a film crew in tow, taking Prince Michael by surprise [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1321.94s)]
*  and then roughing him up. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1327.3s)]
*  They tied my elbow together, my knees together, my feet together, my hands down to my knees [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1329.14s)]
*  and they picked me up and they sponsored the other in German. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1334.26s)]
*  Let's chuck this bastard over the side, he's too much trouble. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1336.98s)]
*  You're a full on political prisoner right now. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1340.26s)]
*  Sea land had fallen. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1343.78s)]
*  After three days, Michael was released. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1345.62s)]
*  Did Michael and his father then return via helicopter, fully armed and flanked by a group [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1348.58s)]
*  of bruisers to stage a successful countercoup? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1353.42s)]
*  Yes, yes they did. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1356.62s)]
*  I jumped and landed, crashed in the middle of the Germans. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1359.26s)]
*  The sort of shotgun hit the deck, boom, and all the Germans went like that. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1362.3s)]
*  Surrender, that's it. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1366.46s)]
*  You've reclaimed your principality. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1367.86s)]
*  Disarmed, the plotters were released, all except for one. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1370.5400000000002s)]
*  His name was Putz. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1374.3000000000002s)]
*  And he was made to clean the bathroom, make coffee, and imposed a fine for treason, $37,000. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1375.88s)]
*  His imprisonment brought a German diplomat to sea land. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1384.14s)]
*  But if you have German emissaries coming here to try and negotiate the release of this prisoner, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1387.46s)]
*  doesn't that imply that sea land is a state that's having relations? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1394.3400000000001s)]
*  Absolutely, it's de facto recognition, hasn't it happened? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1398.86s)]
*  This diplomatic visit was critical for the Bates family. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1402.86s)]
*  An international treaty signed in the 1930s established four requirements for statehood. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1406.5s)]
*  One is recognition by another state. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1412.8999999999999s)]
*  Sea land had already met the other tests. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1415.6799999999998s)]
*  A government check, a defined territory check, and a permanent population check, thanks to [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1417.86s)]
*  Michael Barrington. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1424.8999999999999s)]

*  I do most of the engineering work, electrically and whatever. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1427.8600000000001s)]

*  The British government or anybody else that decides to take us over. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1436.46s)]
*  We're our country after all, a small nation. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1439.46s)]
*  You're ready to use weapons if you have to? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1441.94s)]
*  If need be, yes. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1444.3400000000001s)]
*  No hesitation. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1445.3400000000001s)]
*  But in recent years, to keep sea land afloat, the Bates family has updated their pirate [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=1446.3400000000001s)]

*  Yeah, we thought that the monkeys were going to die. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2001.14s)]
*  James Hyam and Noah Snyder-Mackler couldn't get any news about their colleagues or the [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2004.14s)]
*  monkeys. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2010.66s)]
*  Two days after the storm, the team came up with an idea. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2011.66s)]
*  And you hired a helicopter? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2015.8600000000001s)]
*  We hired a helicopter. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2017.02s)]
*  They enlisted the pilot to fly over CAIO and do a survey, and they had a list of questions. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2018.8200000000002s)]
*  Can you see any monkeys? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2025.8600000000001s)]
*  Are they alive? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2026.8600000000001s)]
*  What is the status of the vegetation? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2028.26s)]
*  Are there standing pools of water that they might be able to drink? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2030.8200000000002s)]
*  Angelina, who had decided to go up with the pilot, was horrified. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2034.98s)]
*  This is footage she shot from the helicopter. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2041.38s)]
*  I see this destruction, like 80 plus years of work completely flattened. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2044.1000000000001s)]
*  This is CAIO before the hurricane, with a dense canopy of trees and lush foliage. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2053.38s)]
*  This is after. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2060.44s)]
*  A green oasis turned brown, buried in dead branches. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2061.7000000000003s)]
*  The island lost two-thirds of its vegetation. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2067.26s)]
*  Heartbroken by what she was seeing from the air, Angelina wanted a closer look. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2071.9s)]
*  But even on the ground, she didn't see any monkeys. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2076.9s)]
*  So then I get on the helicopter again. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2081.18s)]
*  Back up again. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2083.3399999999997s)]
*  And I need to look up there here. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2084.3399999999997s)]
*  And that's when I see a social group running from the helicopter. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2087.22s)]
*  And I go, there's monkeys. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2091.66s)]
*  They're still CAIO. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2093.8599999999997s)]
*  I think I estimated, OK, that must be around 300, 400 monkeys or so. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2096.58s)]
*  Out of 1,700. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2102.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2103.98s)]
*  But once the staff was able to return and do a complete census on the ground, they found, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2104.98s)]
*  to their utter astonishment, that most had lived. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2112.42s)]
*  They estimated just about 50 had died. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2117.06s)]
*  And you're thinking, how could they survive this? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2120.46s)]
*  How could they? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2123.48s)]
*  How could they survive this? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2124.94s)]
*  It's still a mystery. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2127.82s)]
*  What did the monkeys do to ride out the storm? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2129.46s)]
*  Where did they shelter from the wind? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2132.58s)]
*  And what did they eat? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2134.7400000000002s)]
*  So one of the big questions is, without being fed, how were they nourished? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2136.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so although the hurricane did dramatically de-vegetate the island, one thing it also [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2142.78s)]
*  was deposited a great amount of seaweed and algae onto the island. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2150.36s)]
*  And so one possibility is that the monkeys were eating more of this kind of vegetation. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2155.4s)]
*  Which they still seem to enjoy. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2160.78s)]
*  After the hurricane, the monkeys had to adjust to a new, far more hostile environment. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2163.88s)]
*  Their innate adaptability certainly helped. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2170.16s)]
*  So they bob up and down to try and stop themselves from falling forward. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2173.44s)]
*  Six years after the storm, the adjusting continues. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2177.92s)]
*  Attempts to replant the trees have been stymied because the monkeys, ever curious about anything [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2182.44s)]
*  new in their environment, uproot them before they have a chance to grow. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2188.6800000000003s)]
*  So now there's very little shade. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2194.2400000000002s)]
*  This used to be almost forested, right? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2197.48s)]
*  Lots of space and shade. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2200.4s)]
*  Now they're forced to sit in a few shaded areas. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2201.6s)]
*  So they've been clumped by the changing distribution of shade. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2205.76s)]
*  So an interesting thing that we saw is that individuals became more social. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2210.52s)]
*  Not just more social. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2217.04s)]
*  The researchers have noticed that the monkeys are more tolerant of each other, which at [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2218.6800000000003s)]
*  first seemed counterintuitive. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2223.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm thinking of humans in a situation where there's fewer resources. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2226.36s)]
*  And I see in my mind's eye competition. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2231.88s)]
*  I see them saying, get off my property or whatever. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2234.32s)]
*  But you're saying that it was the opposite here. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2237.2000000000003s)]
*  Perhaps, but there's also famous examples of people pulling together. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2240.1200000000003s)]
*  So I think it can go both ways. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2244.84s)]
*  We're capable of great greed and competition and cruelty, but humans are also capable of [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2247.2400000000002s)]
*  great kindness and compassion and friendship and generosity. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2254.82s)]
*  And that kind of duality exists in rhesus mechectic societies too. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2259.6600000000003s)]
*  And I think anyone you talk to here in Puerto Rico would bring up the fact that the people [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2264.6600000000003s)]
*  of Puerto Rico sort of gelled and increased their support of one another in the face of [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2269.9s)]
*  this event. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2273.78s)]
*  Beyond observing their social interactions, they were also able to track biological changes [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2275.2200000000003s)]
*  since they had access to blood tests done on the monkeys for 13 years. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2281.38s)]
*  So what we found is that individuals who had lived through the hurricane had immune systems [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2287.0600000000004s)]
*  that looked like they had aged an extra two years. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2292.54s)]
*  What is that in human years? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2296.04s)]
*  Is it six to eight human years? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2297.46s)]
*  They aged six to eight years? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2299.5800000000004s)]
*  They aged six to eight human years. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2302.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2304.6200000000003s)]
*  Through the trauma. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2306.92s)]
*  That was on average. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2308.0600000000004s)]
*  It's the work that we're trying to do right now is what makes some of these individuals [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2309.46s)]
*  more resilient to the hurricane, right? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2314.54s)]
*  Is the hypothesis that it has something to do with friendships? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2317.2200000000003s)]
*  We think that those individuals who are able to have stronger bonds, stronger friendships [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2321.46s)]
*  might have been protected from this really stressful event. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2327.2400000000002s)]
*  The hurricane opened all new avenues of their research with questions such as what predicts [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2332.34s)]
*  who survives a catastrophe like an earthquake or a hurricane and how quickly they recover. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2339.14s)]
*  So when you step back and look at your study in terms of climate related trauma or any [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2347.42s)]
*  kind of trauma, are you expecting to find answers for survivability in these situations [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2354.42s)]
*  for human beings? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2362.36s)]
*  Given the strong similarity between these primates, these monkeys and us, we know that [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2363.72s)]
*  a lot of the work that we're doing and the things that they might do to be more resilient [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2369.72s)]
*  to this might be translatable to humans, to us, and might provide ways for us to intervene [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2376.7599999999998s)]
*  and help buffer against the negative effects of these traumatic events. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2383.4399999999996s)]
*  If faith is a mystery, there are few places in the Christian world where the mystery is [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2393.72s)]
*  deeper than in Lalabella. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2402.7799999999997s)]
*  Eight hundred years ago, an Ethiopian king ordered a new capital for Christians. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2405.3999999999996s)]
*  At 8,000 feet on the central plateau of Ethiopia stand 11 churches, each carved from a single [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2411.18s)]
*  gigantic block of stone. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2418.36s)]

*  Not much is known about who built them or why, but the faithful of the Ethiopian Orthodox [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2429.02s)]
*  Church say there's no mystery really. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2434.9s)]
*  The churches of Lalabella were built by angels. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2438.1200000000003s)]
*  The northern highlands of Ethiopia rose 31 million years ago when fissures in the earth [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2443.52s)]
*  flooded the Horn of Africa with lava a mile deep. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2449.7599999999998s)]

*  Iron made the basalt red and gases trapped inside made the stone light, as light and [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2460.12s)]
*  pliable as air. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2467.0s)]
*  The Christians laid their mark on Ethiopia before the year 400. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2471.4s)]
*  They found the ancient stone welcomed the bite of a chisel. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2475.36s)]
*  The churches were carved around the year 1200 by people called the Zagwe. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2480.02s)]
*  Their king, Lalabella, is said to have traveled the 1600 miles to Jerusalem. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2486.78s)]
*  Legend has it when he returned and Jerusalem fell to the Islamic conquest, Lalabella ordered [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2493.36s)]
*  a new home for Christianity. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2499.44s)]
*  And he came back with an ambitious idea or vision of creating an African Jerusalem, a [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2502.28s)]
*  black Jerusalem here in the highlands of Ethiopia. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2509.4s)]
*  Fasel Georgis is an Ethiopian architect and historian who walked us through the rock of [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2513.2000000000003s)]
*  ages. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2518.92s)]
*  Well, there are three groups of churches and each group is interconnected within itself. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2519.92s)]
*  We're sitting in St. Mary's Church. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2527.92s)]
*  How was it built? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2530.96s)]
*  Well, it was built starting from outside. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2532.36s)]
*  They formed the shape and then they start digging or excavating downwards. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2536.64s)]
*  So they dug essentially a trench around the whole perimeter which left them with a giant [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2542.32s)]
*  cube of solid rock. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2547.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2549.64s)]
*  And then they carved their doors and in they went? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2550.64s)]
*  In they went. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2553.4s)]
*  Shipping inside largely in darkness, artists sculpted many rooms with no room for error. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2554.4s)]
*  Archways, vaults and columns imitate traditional construction even though in solid rock there's [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2561.4s)]
*  no need to hold up the ceiling. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2568.8s)]
*  The enduring mystery is why. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2571.44s)]
*  Why did King Lalabella attempt the seemingly impossible when easier building techniques [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2574.48s)]
*  were known? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2580.64s)]
*  As the story goes, he was helped by angels who worked on the project overnight. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2581.72s)]
*  I think I would rather take this as a symbolic thing because... [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2587.12s)]
*  Do you not have any experience working with angels in architecture? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2591.64s)]
*  Well, I get inspiration from angels. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2595.24s)]
*  The site of the 11 churches covers about 62 acres. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2599.24s)]
*  It's divided by a stream King Lalabella christened the River Jordan. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2604.88s)]
*  The largest church covers around 8,000 square feet. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2611.88s)]
*  Each is about four stories tall. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2615.96s)]
*  But their most astounding dimension cannot be measured. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2619.04s)]
*  It is the length to which they summon adoration. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2624.7200000000003s)]
*  This is considered to be a holy place. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2630.56s)]
*  That coming here as a devout Christian is a very strong sign of their belief. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2634.2799999999997s)]
*  Some people travel hundreds of kilometers to get here on foot, on foot, and they have [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2641.4399999999996s)]
*  been doing it for several centuries. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2646.68s)]
*  The churches are open for worship year round, but we were there Christmas Eve when nearly [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2652.3999999999996s)]
*  200,000 pilgrims rose to heaven on a path descending into the earth. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2658.2s)]
*  Many walked for days or weeks fasting, robed in white, an ordeal that is rinsed from the [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2665.48s)]
*  disciples in the tradition of Jesus. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2672.96s)]
*  Any Ethiopian over the age of 30 cannot forget the suffering of drought and war and a million [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2680.32s)]
*  people lost to starvation. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2687.52s)]
*  And so having known poverty in this life, they've invested their souls in the next. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2690.0800000000004s)]
*  Tawolda Yigzao told us, I believe God is here. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2697.36s)]
*  I came with faith. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2701.32s)]
*  Her neighbor, Gaitier Ababao, and his daughter told us they walked from their farms nearly [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2703.28s)]
*  100 miles away, a journey of three days. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2709.48s)]
*  God can hear your prayers anywhere. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2714.1600000000003s)]
*  Why did you feel you had to be here? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2716.12s)]
*  So that God can see our devotion, she said, and our dedication. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2719.24s)]
*  We were very tired, he said. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2725.7599999999998s)]
*  We were falling and getting back up throughout the journey, all to see the celebration here. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2728.04s)]
*  And God will recognize our effort. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2734.04s)]
*  The Christmas celebration Ethiopians call Genna compresses them shoulder to shoulder [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2747.08s)]
*  to fast and chant and praise all night till dawn brings Christmas Day. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2752.72s)]
*  The Ethiopian Orthodox Church claims to be among the earliest capitals of Christianity [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2761.64s)]
*  thanks to a mysterious figure of the Hebrew Bible. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2768.12s)]
*  The faithful believe that the queen of Sheba left Ethiopia, went to Jerusalem, where she [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2773.0s)]
*  met King Solomon. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2779.08s)]
*  From that meeting came a son. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2780.92s)]
*  And when the son was an adult, he returned to Ethiopia with 12,000 Israelites and the [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2783.12s)]
*  Ark of the Covenant, containing the tablets with the word of God, the Ten Commandments. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2789.88s)]
*  And the Ark remains in Ethiopia, according to the priests of the Orthodox Church. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2797.08s)]
*  We met Tage Saleh Mazgabu, the head priest of Lalabela, at the Church of St. George, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2803.48s)]
*  which was last to be built and judged to be the masterpiece. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2811.2400000000002s)]
*  I met a woman on Christmas Day who had spent three days walking here. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2815.84s)]
*  Who are these pilgrims? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2822.0s)]
*  These are believers, he told us, not just three days, even three months sometimes. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2824.64s)]
*  When there was no air travel or buses, people used to travel from various parts of the country [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2835.52s)]
*  for months to come here and celebrate with us. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2840.8399999999997s)]
*  The celebration beats to the rhythm of ancient instruments. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2849.48s)]
*  A cabaro, double-headed drum, and a rattle called the Sistrum, whose sound was known [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2854.24s)]
*  in North Africa 3,000 years before Jesus. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2861.16s)]
*  On Christmas Eve, we watched you and your priests lead the chant all night long. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2866.4399999999996s)]
*  What are you saying in that chant? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2873.9199999999996s)]
*  We tell the people that God became human and a human became God. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2876.2599999999998s)]
*  As of Christ, we went from being punished by God to being his children again. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2882.78s)]
*  Christmas is the day that forgiveness was born. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2889.94s)]
*  But while God forgives, time does not. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2894.34s)]
*  After eight centuries, the basalt basilicas are weary of wind and water. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2898.82s)]
*  What's absolutely clear is that something quite miraculous happened here. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2904.94s)]
*  Stephen Battle is an architect with the World Monuments Fund, who told us Lalabella's miracle [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2908.7s)]
*  is being undermined because the rock is not rock solid. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2914.7s)]
*  When you're building a conventional building, you go to a quarry and you'll have different [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2919.3799999999997s)]
*  grades of stone, and you try and select the best stone and leave the bad stuff behind. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2923.7799999999997s)]
*  When you're carving a church out of the mountainside, you don't have that luxury. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2928.2999999999997s)]
*  And so typically in any one of the churches here, you get good stone, and a lot of it [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2934.58s)]
*  is good stone, but then you also get actually bad stone and actually very bad stone, which [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2939.66s)]
*  is really very soft indeed. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2944.94s)]
*  And over time, if you touch it, it actually crumbles. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2947.0s)]
*  And this is one of the most sacred parts of Lalabella. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2949.88s)]
*  We saw the good and the bad in the chamber where King Lalabella is laid to rest. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2953.6s)]
*  This is one of the best preserved sculptures I've seen at Lalabella. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2959.46s)]
*  Yes, this is particularly beautiful, and they're also painted. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2964.2200000000003s)]
*  Simon Warwick is a master stone mason, also with the World Monuments Fund, a U.S.-based [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2967.46s)]
*  charity that preserves some of humankind's great achievements. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2973.54s)]
*  Warwick has repaired European cathedrals and Roman antiquities, but Lalabella is more complicated [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2979.34s)]
*  because of the sincere belief that angels worked this stone. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2986.34s)]
*  Simon, you can't actually cut this stone in order to fit a new piece in because the stone [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2991.26s)]
*  you would be cutting is sacred. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2996.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, this was one of the first big issues that I came across. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=2998.94s)]
*  If we ever had to drill a hole to strengthen it, put in a pin, we had to discuss it with [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3003.3s)]
*  the priests. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3008.26s)]
*  They collected the dust. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3009.58s)]
*  There was a whole procedure around touching the fabric of the church. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3011.74s)]
*  The priest collected the dust? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3015.8999999999996s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3018.7s)]
*  That was the issue when Warwick was asked to resurrect the cross in this window without [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3020.8199999999997s)]
*  disturbing the fragment that remained. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3025.9599999999996s)]
*  So this cross wasn't here? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3028.8599999999997s)]
*  It was completely gone, yes. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3029.8599999999997s)]
*  There was a very, very thin piece of stone remaining. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3030.8599999999997s)]
*  So I hollowed out the back of the cross shape that we were inserting so that it was fitting [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3033.3799999999997s)]
*  over the original stone a bit like a dentist. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3039.66s)]
*  And so we were able to conserve this tiny bit of stone, which is, in stone masonry terms, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3043.9s)]
*  it's crazy. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3050.38s)]
*  But you have to do that in this kind of situation. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3051.38s)]
*  There have been other crazy conservation ideas. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3054.3199999999997s)]
*  A dozen years ago, five umbrellas were built to keep the heavens from pouring down. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3057.2999999999997s)]
*  The local people call them gas station roofs. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3063.78s)]
*  And I think it's a pretty apt way of describing them. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3068.6200000000003s)]
*  So you can imagine, we have this extraordinary site with some of the most beautiful buildings [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3071.4s)]
*  in the world, with extraordinary huge spiritual significance. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3074.9s)]
*  And there's a bunch of gas station roofs that have been placed over the top of them. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3078.98s)]
*  It's really not compatible. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3082.5800000000004s)]
*  It's not appropriate. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3084.1000000000004s)]
*  Unholy to behold, the roofs became a lesson in the law of unintended consequences. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3085.78s)]
*  The churches were too wet. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3091.9s)]
*  Now they're too dry. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3094.02s)]
*  For the first time in 900 years, they're not being rained on. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3095.34s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3098.42s)]
*  And so the stone is contracting much more than it has ever done before. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3099.42s)]
*  And what happens is this creates little failures on a micro level and the stone starts to crumble. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3103.64s)]
*  The roofs were meant to be temporary, and in a few years they must be recovered. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3109.14s)]
*  Stephen Battle prays they'll be removed altogether and replaced by intensive maintenance. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3114.46s)]
*  To that end, the World Monuments Fund is teaching conservation to dozens of Lalabella's [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3121.44s)]
*  priests and laymen in the hope that a host can protect the heavenly, perhaps for centuries [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3126.84s)]
*  to come. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3133.84s)]
*  How long can they last? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3135.0s)]
*  Well, another 900 years if they're looked after properly. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3136.44s)]
*  Oh yes, we're beyond a shadow of a doubt, absolutely, if they're looked after correctly. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3139.68s)]
*  Even beyond another millennia, we're not likely to know with certainty the answer to [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3145.4s)]
*  why. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ls1uNEzN5A&t=3150.7400000000002s)]
