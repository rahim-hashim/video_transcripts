# Space | 60 Minutes Marathon
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [March 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw)
*  NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has hardly opened its eyes, and the universe is new, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=0.0s)]
*  more mysterious, more beautiful than humanity's dreams. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=21.84s)]
*  The largest telescope ever flown launched into deep space on Christmas Day 2021. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=26.24s)]
*  Its primary mission is to reveal the let there be light moment when the stars and galaxies [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=33.12s)]
*  first ignited after the Big Bang. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=39.68s)]
*  Recently, we got a look at some captivating images as Webb peers back toward the origin [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  of everything. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=50.12s)]
*  This is one of Webb's early deep dives into the cosmos. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=53.96s)]
*  250 hours of exposures that expand the imagination. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=58.76s)]
*  And all these little dots are stars? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=65.28s)]
*  All these little dots are galaxies, some of which are bigger than our own. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=67.0s)]
*  Astrophysicist Brent Robertson flew us through 130,000 galaxies, half never seen before. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=72.08s)]
*  Enormous swirls of billions of stars each, some like our own Milky Way, and others, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=80.36s)]
*  well, out of this world. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=87.88s)]
*  We call this galaxy at the center of the screen the Cosmic Rose. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=90.6s)]
*  Just by chance, it looks like a rose does. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=94.72s)]
*  You can see that dusty red, irregular galaxy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=98.24s)]
*  You know, space is more crowded than you might think, and actually galaxies wind up interacting [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=101.44s)]
*  with each other. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=106.16s)]
*  They actually will merge together. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=107.16s)]
*  So I'm zooming in now on a pair of galaxies that are merging together, interacting. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=108.92s)]
*  You can see that they're disturbed because the gravity of one galaxy yanks the stars [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=114.44s)]
*  out of the other galaxy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=119.56s)]
*  They're running into each other. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=121.12s)]
*  They're running into each other. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=122.12s)]
*  Robertson, of the University of California Santa Cruz, helps lead Webb's most ambitious [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=123.88s)]
*  mission, the Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=130.48s)]
*  Well, we've discovered the most distant galaxy in the universe, the one that is the furthest [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=135.72s)]
*  away from us that we currently know about. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=141.0s)]
*  I'd like to share that with you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=143.48s)]
*  Can I show you some pictures? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=144.48s)]
*  Please. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=145.48s)]
*  I'd love to see it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=146.48s)]
*  So as we zoom in, we keep going, we keep going. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=147.48s)]
*  And now this red splotch that you see there, that galaxy, that's a galaxy, that galaxy [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=151.16s)]
*  is more than 33 billion light years away. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=157.32s)]
*  How long after the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe, did this galaxy form? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=162.14s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=167.54s)]
*  It's only 320 million years after the Big Bang. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=168.54s)]
*  The most distant galaxy so far, there on the right, doesn't look like much, but astronomers [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=172.38s)]
*  can fill textbooks by analyzing the spectrum of its light. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=178.94s)]
*  So we can actually measure things like how fast it's forming stars. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=184.77999999999997s)]
*  We can measure the amount of stars in the galaxy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=188.77999999999997s)]
*  We know the size because we know how far away it is. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=190.98s)]
*  And we know the typical age of the stars in the galaxy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=194.26s)]
*  So we know a lot. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=196.84s)]
*  The earliest galaxy so far formed when the universe was 2% of its current age, and the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=198.22s)]
*  baby galaxy ignited stars at a furious pace. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=204.89999999999998s)]
*  It's like a hummingbird. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=210.33999999999997s)]
*  You know, the heartbeat of this galaxy is so rapid. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=211.33999999999997s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=214.7s)]
*  Well, this galaxy is forming stars at about the rate of the Milky Way, even though it's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  100 times less massive. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=220.62s)]
*  So it really is like a hummingbird. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=223.14000000000001s)]
*  The heartbeat of this galaxy is racing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=224.74s)]
*  T minus 30 seconds and counting. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=227.74s)]
*  More than a few human hearts were racing in 2021 as the $10 billion observatory readied [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=229.8s)]
*  for launch. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=237.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=239.66s)]
*  Earlier that year, we were among the last to see Webb in California before it was folded [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=242.46s)]
*  into a 15-foot wide nose cone. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=248.78s)]
*  Well, somehow that's a lot bigger than I imagined. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=251.98s)]
*  25 years in the making, Webb is named for an early NASA administrator. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=256.06s)]
*  Northrop Grumman engineer Amy Lowe showed us down below the silver-colored sunshield, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=262.86s)]
*  big as a tennis court, and 21 feet of gold-plated mirrors for gathering light. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=270.14s)]
*  There are 18 of these hexagonal mirrors, but when you fold them out, they all work in concert [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=277.5s)]
*  as one mirror. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=285.62s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=286.62s)]
*  All 18 images will form one very nice solid image. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=287.62s)]
*  And liftoff. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=292.5s)]
*  Decolage. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=294.74s)]
*  Decolage. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=295.74s)]
*  Liftoff. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=296.74s)]
*  From a tropical rainforest to the edge of time itself, James Webb begins a voyage back [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=297.74s)]
*  to the birth of the universe. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=303.54s)]
*  Webb lofted on a European rocket into an orbit around the sun a million miles away. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  To set up for observations, engineers used a star to align those mirrors. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=313.41999999999996s)]
*  But the image was speckled with what looked like artifacts of digital noise, which forced [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=319.71999999999997s)]
*  a closer look. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=326.53999999999996s)]
*  These were not artifacts from the detector. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=328.52s)]
*  These were not strange stars. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=330.68s)]
*  The whole of the sky was filled with galaxies. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=333.38s)]
*  There was no empty sky. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=336.74s)]
*  And that's when I went, this telescope's going to be phenomenal. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=339.06s)]
*  Matt Mountain leads Webb's operations as president of the Association of Universities for Research [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  in Astronomy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=349.86s)]
*  No empty sky. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=351.5s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=352.5s)]
*  In almost every image we're taking now, we see galaxies everywhere. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=354.3s)]
*  I mean, we took a simple picture of a planet in our own system, Neptune. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=358.65999999999997s)]
*  You know, it was this beautiful orb just sitting there, and we saw some rings. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=362.7s)]
*  And the background? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=367.41999999999996s)]
*  A galaxy again. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=368.41999999999996s)]
*  It tells us that our universe is filled with galaxies. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=370.46s)]
*  We knew this theoretically. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=373.58s)]
*  But when you go out to the night sky, we're used to saying, well, look up at night sky. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=376.21999999999997s)]
*  We see those stars. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=380.56s)]
*  We can no longer say that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=381.56s)]
*  We now have to say, look up at the night sky, and there are galaxies everywhere. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=382.56s)]
*  We call it space because we thought there was nothing out there. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=388.53999999999996s)]
*  There is no empty sky with James Webb. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=391.29999999999995s)]
*  That is what we have discovered. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=393.53999999999996s)]
*  Matt Mountain says that Webb is a reminder of how much we do not know. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=395.29999999999995s)]
*  For example, galaxies are rushing away from each other at greater and greater speed, defying [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=400.9s)]
*  gravity. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=407.61999999999995s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=408.7s)]
*  So scientists infer that there must be unseen elements at work. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=410.58s)]
*  They call them dark energy and dark matter. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=415.7s)]
*  And whenever you hear the term dark energy or dark matter, this means we don't know [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=419.38s)]
*  what it is. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=424.86s)]
*  We're not that imaginative. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=425.86s)]
*  But it is a force. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=427.02s)]
*  It is 95% of our universe, and we have no idea what it is. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=428.02s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=434.82s)]
*  95% of our universe is made up of dark energy and dark matter, and we don't know what it [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=435.82s)]
*  is. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=440.9s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=441.9s)]
*  We're lucky if we even understand 4% of our universe today. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=442.9s)]
*  Astronomy is a very humbling discipline. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=447.7s)]
*  Humbling, but with Webb... [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=450.41999999999996s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=453.85999999999996s)]
*  Also thrilling. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=454.85999999999996s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=455.85999999999996s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=456.85999999999996s)]
*  This is Purdue University astronomer Dan Mili-Savlovich starstruck and chatting with a colleague. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=457.85999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=466.85999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=467.85999999999996s)]
*  Look at the detail. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=468.85999999999996s)]
*  Astronomer Dan Wilbur, who's not an astronomer, strained to see what the excitement was about. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=472.02s)]
*  Mili-Savlovich studies exploded stars, which were the furnaces that forged the first heavy [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=478.97999999999996s)]
*  elements from a cosmos of simple helium and hydrogen. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=485.58s)]
*  Every time there's a supernova explosion, it's producing the raw materials for life. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=490.94s)]
*  The iron in our blood, the calcium in our bones, the oxygen that we breathe. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=496.9s)]
*  Love that oxygen. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=504.41999999999996s)]
*  All that is being manufactured in supernova explosions. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=505.7s)]
*  The late astronomer Carl Sagan used to say, we're all made of star stuff. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=509.65999999999997s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=513.92s)]
*  Webb reveals unprecedented detail at the center of these explosions. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=516.1s)]
*  And that's what Webb is most sensitive to for our purposes. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=522.42s)]
*  We're seeing what's happening inside the explosion that we couldn't see before because it only [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=526.6999999999999s)]
*  comes out in infrared light. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=531.54s)]
*  Infrared light is what Webb is designed to see. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=535.1s)]
*  Like a night vision camera, the telescope is sensitive to heat radiation, which is all [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=538.5799999999999s)]
*  that remains of the light reaching us from the dawn of time. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=544.86s)]
*  Trouble is, infrared is invisible to the human eye. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=549.3399999999999s)]
*  When you first pull up the Webb data, what does that look like? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=554.82s)]
*  Essentially it looks like a blank screen. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=560.0600000000001s)]
*  Alisa Pagan and Joe DiPasquale are astronomers and science imagers for the Space Telescope [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=562.9000000000001s)]
*  Science Institute. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=570.94s)]
*  This is what a Webb infrared picture looks like until they match the data-filled darkness [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=573.1800000000001s)]
*  to colors of wonder. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=580.34s)]
*  So we take those longest wavelengths of infrared light and give those the red colors. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=583.22s)]
*  The next shortest wavelengths would be green and then the shortest wavelengths that we [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=587.02s)]
*  get from Webb are colored blue. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=590.26s)]
*  And so just like how our eyes work, we take those three color channels, combine them together [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=592.22s)]
*  to create the full color images that we see from Webb. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=596.38s)]
*  Among their favorite images is this cluster of stars with the not-so-wonderous name NGC-346. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=599.9s)]
*  This dust sculpted into ripples by interactions between stars. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=609.9s)]
*  And the Tarantula Nebula, a star-birthing nursery on a backdrop of galaxies. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=616.1s)]
*  It occurs to me you're the first two people to see these images in human history. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=624.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's quite an honor. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=628.5s)]
*  It is a great honor and it does blow your mind every time. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=630.1s)]
*  There will be many mind-blowing revelations. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=633.86s)]
*  Webb is already the first to find carbon dioxide in the sky of a planet 700 light-years away. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=637.02s)]
*  It will continue to look for planets with atmospheres that might support life. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=644.98s)]
*  On the other end of the time scale, astrophysicist Erica Nelson of the University of Colorado [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=651.22s)]
*  Boulder thinks her team may have made a discovery that she says would break the theory of how [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=657.06s)]
*  the early universe formed. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=665.1s)]
*  Either this is wrong or this is a huge discovery and we think that it's a huge discovery. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=667.66s)]
*  More observations are needed, but Nelson is investigating what may be five giant galaxies [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=676.46s)]
*  that appear to have formed much too quickly after the Big Bang. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=683.78s)]
*  If they're confirmed, astronomy may have to revise the timeline of galaxy formation. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=688.7s)]
*  And that's the most exciting piece of this, of this telescope, of this remarkable instrument [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=695.62s)]
*  we put in space, is finding things that we didn't expect, that we can't explain, because [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=701.46s)]
*  that means that we have to revise our understanding of the universe. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=706.98s)]
*  Brant Robertson, who showed us the earliest galaxy found so far by the James Webb Telescope, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=712.0200000000001s)]
*  told us the record for the earliest will not hold long. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=718.3399999999999s)]
*  How far back can you go to the origins of the universe? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=722.5799999999999s)]
*  Well, JWST is so phenomenal that if you spend enough time you could probably find any galaxy [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=726.38s)]
*  that ever formed in the universe. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=731.66s)]
*  It's really that powerful. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=733.8599999999999s)]
*  Will the history of astronomy be divided between before Webb and after Webb? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=735.54s)]
*  Yes, I believe it will be. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=740.6999999999999s)]
*  Matt Mountain, who manages Webb Operations, told us the observatory may last up to 25 [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=743.58s)]
*  years, perhaps long enough, to comprehend space and time and the origins of life. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=749.94s)]
*  We're seeing a universe we've never seen before. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=758.82s)]
*  We thought it was there, we hoped it was there, but now we see it for the first time. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=763.34s)]
*  When we look up at the stars, it's humbling to realize we are only getting a peek at [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=773.58s)]
*  what's up there. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=787.58s)]
*  That way beyond what's visible to the naked eye lie wondrous galaxies we never knew existed [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=788.98s)]
*  until the Hubble Space Telescope. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=795.34s)]
*  For 27 years since it was launched into space, Hubble has been sending us stunning images [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=798.06s)]
*  of the vast heavens. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=803.9599999999999s)]
*  Over the years, astronauts have repeatedly upgraded Hubble, so its most dramatic discoveries [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=806.04s)]
*  have come recently. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=812.06s)]
*  Tonight, we'll take you up to Hubble and billions of light years beyond to see some of its latest, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=813.54s)]
*  most spectacular revelations. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=820.66s)]
*  NASA celebrates Hubble's birthday each year by giving us a gift, a new breathtaking view [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=824.26s)]
*  of our universe. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=830.9399999999999s)]
*  The latest birthday card? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=832.72s)]
*  This elegant swirl of galaxies dancing in tandem deep in space. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=834.62s)]
*  Last year, this bubble of stellar gases floating among the stars like a diaphanous cosmic jellyfish. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=840.5s)]
*  Hubble has shown us radiant, rose-shaped galaxies stretching across deep space and dramatic [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=849.3s)]
*  towering clouds of gas teeming with the stuff of creation. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=855.42s)]
*  Stars are born here. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=860.5s)]
*  Year after year in the infinite black canvas overhead, Hubble paints an ever-expanding [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=862.54s)]
*  picture of our universe, an awe-inspiring light show for us to admire and for scientists [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=868.1s)]
*  to study. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=874.46s)]
*  I believe Hubble has been the single most transformative scientific instrument that [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=875.46s)]
*  we've ever built. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=881.34s)]
*  Most transformative, says NASA astrophysicist Amber Straughan, because Hubble keeps improving [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=883.1800000000001s)]
*  our understanding of the universe. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=889.02s)]
*  She showed us what Hubble discovered after staring for days into what seemed to be an [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=891.72s)]
*  empty black patch, a deep, dark void in outer space. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=896.98s)]
*  The original Hubble Deep Field is located just above the Big Dipper. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=901.78s)]
*  It's a part of the sky that most people are familiar with. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=906.26s)]
*  It's a blank piece of sky. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=909.74s)]
*  So just nothing in here, just darkness? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=911.14s)]
*  Nothing at all. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=913.3s)]
*  Complete darkness. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=914.3s)]
*  And then when we look at it with Hubble, what we see is thousands of galaxies. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=915.3s)]
*  Not just stars, galaxies. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=919.78s)]
*  Galaxies outside of our own. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=922.26s)]
*  Something we never imagined. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=923.98s)]
*  Is it that Hubble just stares into that dark spot until the light penetrates and reveals [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=925.22s)]
*  That's exactly what happens. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=932.46s)]
*  It's sometimes many, many, many days of just staring at one part of the sky and allowing [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=933.74s)]
*  the photons to collect on your detector. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=939.22s)]
*  And this is what's revealed. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=941.98s)]
*  And this is what's revealed. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=942.98s)]
*  But Hubble was just warming up. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=944.98s)]
*  That was 22 years ago. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=947.32s)]
*  Since then, Hubble has stared deeper and longer into space with enhanced equipment. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=949.78s)]
*  In this particular image, there are 10,000 galaxies. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=955.6800000000001s)]
*  Every single point of light is an individual galaxy, its own little island universe. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=959.34s)]
*  And so this is a real visualization of the distances of these galaxies. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=963.9s)]
*  So sort of like 3D. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=967.74s)]
*  3D, like we're flying through. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=968.74s)]
*  So we can make these images 3D because we know how far away the galaxies are. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=970.86s)]
*  What Hubble has essentially given us is the size of the universe. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=975.6s)]
*  Hubble has taught us that the universe is filled with hundreds of billions of other [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=978.54s)]
*  galaxies. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=982.98s)]
*  And now the latest analysis of Hubble's data reveals there could be more than 2 trillion [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=984.54s)]
*  galaxies, ten times more than previously thought. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=990.46s)]
*  Typical galaxies like our Milky Way have 100 billion stars. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=995.18s)]
*  That means the total number of stars, or suns, out there is 2 followed by 23 zeros. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1000.42s)]
*  That's called 200 sextillion. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1008.5s)]
*  To get some sense of how many stars that is, we went to Adam Reese, who won a Nobel Prize [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1011.72s)]
*  for his work on Hubble. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1017.8000000000001s)]
*  This is more stars in the visible universe than grains of sand on the beach. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1019.64s)]
*  On Earth. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1023.9200000000001s)]
*  On all the beaches on Earth. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1024.92s)]
*  And Hubble has shown us this? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1026.72s)]
*  It has. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1029.18s)]
*  In many cases, it has allowed us to see what some of the most distant galaxies look like [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1030.18s)]
*  and how many stars were in them, and we've been able to add it all up. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1035.0s)]
*  Hubble has been called a time machine. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1039.1200000000001s)]
*  That it looks back in time. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1042.1200000000001s)]
*  What has been the most astounding part of that for you? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1044.8000000000002s)]
*  I study explosions of stars called supernovae. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1049.3200000000002s)]
*  It's like fireworks. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1053.16s)]
*  It's only visible for a short period of time, in this case a few weeks. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1054.16s)]

*  It began its journey when the Earth wasn't even here. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1061.64s)]
*  And over those 10 billion years, our planet formed, life developed, we built a Hubble [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1065.6399999999999s)]
*  space telescope, we opened the aperture door, and in the last one billionth of one percent [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1070.76s)]
*  of that journey that the light made, we opened the door just in time to catch it. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1077.66s)]
*  Hubble almost didn't catch anything. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1083.0s)]
*  The first pictures it sent back were blurry because of a microscopic flaw in the mirror. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1085.28s)]
*  The space agency launched a daring mission to fix it. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1091.8s)]
*  Woo! [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1096.08s)]
*  Astronauts have made five trips to Hubble to repair and upgrade its equipment. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1099.08s)]
*  Okay, John, you can open the cover. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1104.08s)]
*  John Grunsfeld, known as the Hubble repairman, flew three of those missions to a telescope [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1106.52s)]
*  the size of a school bus orbiting 300 miles above Earth. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1112.36s)]
*  Just about anything that we can easily change and upgrade and fix has been fixed. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1117.6s)]
*  The workings of the telescope, all of that has been transformed. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1123.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1126.36s)]
*  It is like a new telescope. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1127.36s)]
*  On your last mission, you come out of the airlock and you've got this big smile on your face. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1128.9599999999998s)]
*  I thought, you know, I can't imagine anywhere I'd rather be than outside the space shuttle [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1136.04s)]
*  in my space suit next to the Hubble space telescope. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1142.04s)]
*  I was just so happy. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1144.6799999999998s)]
*  Hubble has changed what we know about the universe, its structure, evolution, its age, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1146.72s)]
*  13.8 billion years. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1152.6000000000001s)]
*  Hubble showed us the marvel and majesty of stars being born. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1155.52s)]
*  This is a region of gas and dust that's turning up new baby stars. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1160.08s)]
*  And now we've learned with Hubble not only stars but also baby planet systems. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1164.68s)]
*  Most of these stars have planets going around them? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1169.78s)]
*  Most stars actually do have planets. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1173.88s)]
*  When I was a kid we only knew of the planets inside our solar system. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1176.72s)]
*  And now we know that the planets are absolutely everywhere. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1180.16s)]
*  Astronomer Heidi Hammel specializes in Hubble's work within our solar system. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1183.92s)]
*  With the telescope, she saw huge fragments of a comet slam into Jupiter, creating giant [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1189.6000000000001s)]
*  impacts. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1196.6000000000001s)]
*  When I first heard that a comet was going to hit Jupiter, my reaction was, eh, so what? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1198.16s)]
*  Jupiter's huge, comets are small. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1203.92s)]
*  And so when I saw the first impact site and it was huge and dark, I was flabbergasted. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1207.44s)]
*  This is where the comet has smacked into the planet at such a high velocity that it's caused [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1217.04s)]
*  an explosion, the equivalent of many, many millions of atomic bombs. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1223.36s)]
*  The Earth is the size of that ring. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1229.12s)]
*  And so if this event had happened on Earth... [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1231.48s)]
*  We're gone. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1235.16s)]
*  Yeah, we call that a biosphere changing event, which basically means we'd be gone. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1236.16s)]
*  Hubble orbits high outside Earth's atmosphere so it can see a wide spectrum of light our [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1243.0s)]
*  atmosphere blocks. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1248.92s)]
*  Beyond Earth's protective layer, Hubble's ultraviolet camera can spot dazzling displays [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1250.92s)]
*  like this glowing halo on top of Jupiter. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1257.4s)]
*  Up in the Northern Hemisphere, what you're seeing is the glowing aurorae. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1260.2s)]
*  An aurora happens when the planet's magnetic field has charged particles that interact [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1265.64s)]
*  with the upper atmosphere. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1271.96s)]
*  What you're seeing there is actually charged particles from the sun that get swept up in [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1273.48s)]
*  Jupiter's strong magnetic field and then it's mirrored in that shimmering that you see inside [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1277.96s)]
*  the auroral oval. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1283.8s)]
*  And you would not be able to see that with an Earth telescope? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1285.44s)]
*  You could never see those aurorae because our atmosphere has an ozone layer that absorbs [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1288.8s)]
*  the ultraviolet light. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1295.24s)]
*  Hubble also found a similar blue hue at the bottom of Saturn. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1297.2s)]
*  The telescope's most iconic picture is this, the Pillars of Creation, a stellar breeding [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1301.9199999999998s)]
*  place. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1307.68s)]
*  Amber Strawn showed us what a difference Hubble's upgraded infrared camera made just two years [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1309.0s)]
*  ago. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1315.2s)]
*  Stars are born inside these dust clouds. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1316.2s)]
*  And this is going to give you a clue on why infrared is so important. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1318.6s)]
*  It's because in infrared light, what you see is the stars inside shining through. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1322.24s)]
*  How big is this cloud area? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1328.3999999999999s)]
*  Top to bottom, these pillars are about 10 light years, which is about 60 trillion miles. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1330.72s)]
*  60 trillion miles. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1336.28s)]
*  Space is big. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1339.12s)]
*  Big and miraculous, with constant celestial regeneration. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1341.08s)]
*  Strawn calls this the everything picture because you can see old stars blowing up and new stars [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1346.36s)]
*  forming. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1353.56s)]
*  Anytime you see these sort of dark, cloudy regions, you can imagine that there's stars [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1354.84s)]
*  being born inside there. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1359.56s)]
*  Where are the dying stars? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1361.6799999999998s)]
*  And the dying stars, we think that this one could explode any day, literally, or it could [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1362.6799999999998s)]
*  be a thousand years from now, but near, near term in astronomers' time. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1367.24s)]
*  In cosmic times, any day. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1371.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1372.56s)]
*  Big stars, when they die, they explode and send their contents into the surrounding universe. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1373.76s)]
*  And these contents are what seed future stars and future planets and help to seed life, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1380.3999999999999s)]
*  ultimately. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1386.48s)]
*  The iron in your blood and the calcium in your bones was literally forged inside of [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1387.48s)]
*  a star that ended its life like this. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1392.12s)]
*  So we are all stardust. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1394.6799999999998s)]
*  We literally are stardust. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1396.24s)]
*  We are viscerally made of the stars. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1397.84s)]
*  One of the things I think is remarkable about this image is it shows you how colorful the [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1400.52s)]
*  universe is. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1404.48s)]
*  This looks like contemporary art. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1405.48s)]
*  This is a very tightly bound group of stars. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1407.14s)]
*  And what you see here is about 100,000 stars. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1411.08s)]
*  This was one of the first images that Hubble's new camera installed in 2009. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1415.1200000000001s)]
*  This was one of the first images it took. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1419.64s)]
*  Blue stars are the youngest and hottest. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1422.1200000000001s)]
*  White and yellow stars, like our sun, are midlife, while red stars are the oldest and [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1425.24s)]
*  coolest. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1431.24s)]
*  What a beautiful view. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1432.24s)]
*  John Grunsfeld has a cool claim to fame. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1433.52s)]
*  He's the last human to touch Hubble. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1437.36s)]
*  He gave it a farewell pat. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1440.36s)]
*  Hubble was planned to live for 15 years. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1442.64s)]
*  It's now been 27. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1446.8s)]
*  How much longer can Hubble go? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1448.4s)]
*  I'm reasonably confident it will continue another three to five years. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1450.08s)]
*  That means for a while at least, Hubble will work in tandem with its successor, the much [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1454.52s)]
*  larger James Webb Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2019. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1459.6s)]
*  Webb should be able to detect light from the very earliest galaxies. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1465.3600000000001s)]
*  The farthest back Hubble can see is this red blob, a galaxy from 400 million years after [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1470.0s)]
*  the Big Bang. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1476.72s)]
*  Webb should take us much closer to the beginning of time. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1478.56s)]
*  The James Webb Space Telescope was specifically designed to see the first stars and galaxies [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1483.08s)]
*  that were formed in the universe. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1488.1599999999999s)]
*  So we're going to see the snapshot of when stars started, when galaxies started, the [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1489.8799999999999s)]
*  very first moments of the universe. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1495.76s)]
*  And my bet, there's going to be some big surprises. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1497.4399999999998s)]
*  In the history of spaceflight, only four entities have launched a space capsule into orbit and [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1500.44s)]
*  successfully brought it back to the earth. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1517.56s)]
*  The United States, Russia, China, and Elon Musk. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1520.3200000000002s)]
*  Mr. Musk is a wealthy internet entrepreneur who has vowed to revolutionize space exploration [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1525.5600000000002s)]
*  by bringing down the astronomical costs. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1531.48s)]
*  And that can't happen fast enough for NASA, which retired the shuttle last summer and [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1534.92s)]
*  now has to pay its old rival, Russia, to fly American astronauts into space. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1540.2s)]
*  Musk is one of the contenders vying for a NASA contract to build America's next manned [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1546.72s)]
*  spacecraft, a contest he believes he has the right stuff to win. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1551.76s)]
*  When the final shuttle mission ended last July, for the first time in three decades, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1565.2s)]
*  the United States had no way to launch astronauts into space. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1571.04s)]
*  It was the end of one era and the beginning of another. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1575.0s)]
*  Instead of NASA designing the next manned spacecraft, the White House decided that private [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1582.32s)]
*  industry should design, build, and fly it, opening space to commercial development. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1587.32s)]
*  One of the companies vying for that contract is SpaceX. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1593.96s)]
*  Elon Musk is the founder and CEO. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1598.16s)]
*  Is what we are experiencing at this moment in time the turning point in man's reach [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1601.48s)]
*  for space going from governments to private companies like yours? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1607.4s)]
*  I think we're at the dawn of a new era and I think it's going to be very exciting. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1612.6s)]
*  What we're hoping to do with SpaceX is to push the envelope and provide a reason for [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1616.28s)]
*  people to be excited and inspired to be human. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1621.48s)]

*  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elon Musk! [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1649.6799999999998s)]
*  Despite a chorus of skeptics, Musk built a car company called Tesla that turns out 5,000 [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1656.56s)]
*  high-end all-electric cars a year. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1664.08s)]
*  Another Musk company sells solar power systems, but his lifelong passion is space. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1667.6399999999999s)]
*  When eBay bought PayPal in 2002, Musk started looking for ways to launch his new fortune into orbit. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1674.56s)]
*  I went to Russia to look at buying a refurbished ICBM, which is a very trippy experience. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1682.0s)]
*  It was very bizarre. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1690.04s)]
*  And when I tell people that, they're like, what? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1693.04s)]
*  Musk made three trips to Russia trying to buy an intercontinental ballistic missile called the Nieper. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1696.36s)]
*  His plan was bizarre. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1705.04s)]
*  Put a greenhouse on the rocket, land it on Mars, and beam back the pictures. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1707.12s)]
*  It'll get people really excited, and that would recharge human space exploration. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1712.36s)]
*  That was my original idea. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1716.12s)]
*  You just wanted to get people interested in space again? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1717.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1719.76s)]
*  Capture the imagination? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1720.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1721.76s)]
*  That was the idea. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1722.76s)]
*  Turns out the Nieper was so expensive, his idea never flew. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1723.76s)]
*  So Musk decided that the only way to get an affordable rocket was to build it himself, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1728.04s)]
*  and he started SpaceX. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1734.24s)]
*  The odds of me coming into the rocket business, not knowing anything about rockets, not having [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1735.24s)]
*  ever built anything, I mean, I would have to be insane if I took the odds are in my [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1739.44s)]
*  favor. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1743.28s)]
*  Why even begin? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1744.28s)]
*  When something is important enough, you do it even though the odds are not in your favor. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1746.28s)]
*  How much of your personal fortune have you poured into this? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1749.98s)]
*  A hundred million dollars. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1752.8s)]
*  A hundred million dollars into something that you did not believe would work at the beginning. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1754.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1759.6399999999999s)]
*  Musk truly believes that low-cost space exploration is essential to the survival of mankind. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1760.6399999999999s)]
*  I think it's important that humanity become a multi-planet species. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1767.28s)]
*  I think most people would agree that a future where we are a space-faring civilization is [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1770.76s)]
*  inspiring and exciting compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth until some [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1775.76s)]
*  eventual extinction event. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1780.6s)]
*  That's really why I started SpaceX. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1782.72s)]
*  SpaceX is housed in a sprawling factory near Los Angeles where fuselages for Boeing 747s [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1785.48s)]
*  used to be built. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1791.76s)]
*  From its beginning ten years ago, its goal has been revolutionary change in rocket and [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1794.6000000000001s)]
*  spacecraft manufacturing. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1800.76s)]
*  Now, tell me, what's that big piece right up there? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1802.32s)]
*  That's the second stage of a Falcon 9 rocket. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1806.1200000000001s)]
*  Instead of multiple companies building parts all across the country, SpaceX builds most [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1810.64s)]
*  of its rockets and spacecraft in-house based on Musk's belief that it's more efficient [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1815.42s)]
*  and lowers costs. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1820.68s)]
*  Fourteen hundred engineers and skilled technicians work here building engines, rockets, space [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1822.3600000000001s)]
*  capsules, creating mostly from scratch the thousands of components that are the guts [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1828.2s)]
*  of a rocket. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1833.5s)]
*  So what that means is raw metal comes in and then we build the engines, the airframe, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1837.0s)]
*  the electronics and we integrate all of that together and that's all done more or less [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1842.64s)]
*  under one roof. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1848.04s)]
*  Metal comes in one end of this factory, spaceships come out the other. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1849.96s)]
*  Final assembly takes place at the Cape Canaveral launch pad. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1855.0s)]
*  If the margin is there and we don't then have margin to the fourth power, that's fine. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1858.56s)]
*  Musk has college degrees in business and physics but SpaceX is his first venture in aerospace. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1863.08s)]
*  He bills himself as chief designer and chief technology officer. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1869.8799999999999s)]
*  How did you get the expertise to be the chief technology officer of a rocket ship company? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1875.0s)]
*  Well, I do have a physics background, that's helpful as a foundation and then I read a [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1880.48s)]
*  lot of books and talked to a lot of smart people. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1885.96s)]
*  You're self-taught? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1889.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1890.12s)]
*  Well, self-taught, yes, meaning I don't have an aerospace degree. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1891.4399999999998s)]
*  So how did you go about acquiring the knowledge? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1895.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, like I said, I read a lot of books, talked to a lot of people and have a great team. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1898.1599999999999s)]
*  His team is a mixture. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1903.52s)]
*  There are newcomers, mostly 30-something engineers, some of them straight out of college, and [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1904.9599999999998s)]
*  then there are the skilled technicians and aerospace veterans. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1910.1599999999999s)]
*  Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman spent three months aboard the space station and [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1914.7199999999998s)]
*  flew on one of the final shuttle missions. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1919.8s)]
*  He was brought in to help oversee the company's manned space work. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1922.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, I'm curious, you have so much background in engineering. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1926.12s)]
*  You could have easily gotten a job at Boeing or at Lockheed, but you came here. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1929.8s)]
*  If you had a chance to go back in time and work with Howard Hughes when he was creating [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1935.36s)]
*  TWA, if you had a chance to be there at that moment when it was the dawn of a brand new [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1939.52s)]
*  era, wouldn't you want to do that? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1944.08s)]
*  I mean, that's why I'm here. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1946.12s)]
*  That's why most of the engineers we met are here. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1948.3999999999999s)]
*  Building spaceships is the chance of a lifetime. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1951.8799999999999s)]
*  If you reach the point of having a successful manned flight, what will you have proven? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1955.32s)]
*  We're not doing it to prove anything. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1960.1599999999999s)]
*  We know it can be done. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1963.7199999999998s)]
*  We're just trying to do it a little bit differently, a little bit faster, and to push the fence [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1964.7199999999998s)]
*  a little bit farther out. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1970.52s)]
*  And then we can all go, I mean, I want to go into space, I assume most people here do [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1971.7199999999998s)]
*  as well. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1974.3999999999999s)]
*  How many want to ride? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1975.3999999999999s)]
*  Uh huh, okay. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1977.2800000000002s)]
*  Everybody wants to go. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1978.2800000000002s)]
*  I'm not so sure. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1979.2800000000002s)]
*  Four, three, two, one. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1982.2800000000002s)]
*  Four years after starting, SpaceX rolled out its first rocket, an unmanned booster called [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1988.2800000000002s)]
*  the Falcon 1. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1994.2800000000002s)]
*  Falcon has cleared the tower. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1995.2800000000002s)]
*  But the first three test flights failed to reach orbit. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=1997.2800000000002s)]
*  We are hearing from the launch control center that there has been an anomaly on the vehicle. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2001.4s)]
*  When you had that third failure in a row, did you think, I need to pack this in? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2007.0800000000002s)]
*  Never. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2013.88s)]
*  Why not? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2014.88s)]
*  I don't ever give up. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2015.88s)]
*  I mean, I'd have to be dead or completely incapacitated. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2018.88s)]
*  It turned out that the third failure was caused by a two-second glitch in the timing. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2023.48s)]
*  Eight weeks later, Musk bet the company on another flight. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2031.3600000000001s)]
*  We have liftoff. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2035.3600000000001s)]
*  And this time around, everything worked. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2037.3600000000001s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2040.3600000000001s)]
*  If that fourth launch hadn't worked, that would have been it. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2041.3600000000001s)]
*  We would have not had the resources to mount a fifth. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2044.3600000000001s)]
*  You couldn't have gone out at that point. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2048.36s)]
*  Yes, death would have been, I think, inevitable because we did not have the resources to mount [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2050.36s)]
*  a fifth launch. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2056.36s)]
*  This is a tricky business. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2057.36s)]
*  Tricky. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2058.36s)]
*  Yeah, the... [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2059.84s)]
*  Yeah, I wish it wasn't so hard. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2060.84s)]
*  In 2010, SpaceX tested a larger, more powerful nine-engine rocket called the Falcon 9 and [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2069.84s)]
*  an unmanned cargo capsule known as Dragon. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2077.84s)]
*  It was the first privately developed rocket designed to carry cargo and eventually astronauts [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2080.84s)]
*  to the space station. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2086.84s)]
*  M-back ignition confirmed. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2088.32s)]
*  3.2 kilometers per second. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2089.32s)]
*  In its first test flight, the Dragon capsule performed flawlessly, orbiting the Earth twice [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2092.32s)]
*  before splashdown in the Pacific, the first time a private company had launched and recovered [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2098.6400000000003s)]
*  its own spacecraft. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2104.7200000000003s)]
*  And this is a historic spacecraft. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2106.7200000000003s)]
*  It is, yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2109.7200000000003s)]
*  We came across the Dragon capsule while Musk was showing us around. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2110.8s)]
*  You know, what I noticed about your cargo ship is that it has windows. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2115.4s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2118.4s)]
*  The windows are there in case there's an astronaut on board who wants to look out. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2119.4s)]
*  But people don't put windows in cargo ships. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2124.4s)]
*  That's right, exactly. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2126.4s)]
*  So what that tells me is that this was never intended to be only a cargo ship. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2127.4s)]
*  No, the Dragon was always designed to carry astronauts. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2131.4s)]
*  Musk says a manned version of the Dragon capsule will be safer than the space shuttle and a [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2135.4s)]

*  That sort of confidence has not exactly endeared him to the space establishment or to his [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2162.6800000000003s)]
*  competitors. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2169.6800000000003s)]

*  you don't know what you don't know. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2176.46s)]
*  Well I suppose that's true of anyone. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2178.96s)]
*  How can anyone know what they don't know? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2180.68s)]
*  When critics say you can't do this, your answer to them is... [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2182.68s)]
*  We've done it. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2187.68s)]
*  He's done it in partnership with NASA, which has given SpaceX technical advice and a contract [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2188.68s)]

*  that would change their mind. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2254.54s)]
*  They inspired you to do this, didn't they? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2256.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2260.06s)]
*  And to see them casting stones in your direction? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2262.06s)]
*  It's difficult. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2265.06s)]
*  Did you expect them to cheer you on? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2270.38s)]
*  So they're hoping they would. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2274.38s)]
*  What are you trying to prove to them? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2276.46s)]
*  What I'm trying to do is to make a significant difference in spaceflight and help make spaceflight [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2278.2200000000003s)]
*  accessible to almost anyone and I would hope for as much support in that direction as we [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2286.06s)]
*  can receive. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2292.78s)]
*  President Obama made his support clear when he visited SpaceX's launch site just before [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2294.58s)]

*  cargo all the way to the space station. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2309.04s)]
*  It was scheduled to fly in February but it's taken longer than expected to perfect the [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2311.88s)]
*  flight software. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2316.7599999999998s)]
*  The flight will be a complicated rendezvous with a space station that is moving 17,000 [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2318.36s)]
*  miles an hour, 240 miles above the earth. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2323.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay, so it looks like our burn performance is nominal. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2327.48s)]
*  In the SpaceX mission control, flight simulations are continuing and if all goes well, SpaceX [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2330.62s)]
*  will begin routine space station cargo deliveries later this year. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2336.92s)]
*  But the big prize is winning the NASA contract to build America's next manned spacecraft [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2341.7s)]
*  and Elon Musk is facing stiff competition. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2347.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm probably not the guy that most people would bet on. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2350.98s)]
*  Who wins? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2354.1s)]
*  It's like a little kid fighting a bunch of sumo wrestlers. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2356.38s)]
*  Usually the sumo wrestlers win. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2360.2200000000003s)]
*  We're a little scrappy company. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2362.02s)]
*  Every now and again, the little scrappy company wins. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2364.58s)]
*  I think this will be one of those times. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2367.76s)]
*  Twelve American men have walked on the moon. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2386.06s)]
*  The last Apollo astronaut left his footprint there in December 1972. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2389.06s)]
*  Now a half century later, NASA is planning to send people back to the moon. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2394.34s)]
*  The new program is called Artemis, after Apollo's mythical twin sister, and the goal is that [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2399.9s)]
*  the next footprint on the moon will be made by a woman. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2406.22s)]
*  The astronaut who gets that assignment hasn't been chosen yet. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2410.02s)]
*  As you're about to see, this new push to the moon has been plagued by doubts, cost overruns, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2413.86s)]
*  and delays. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2419.94s)]
*  But we found something else interesting when we visited NASA. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2421.34s)]
*  The Artemis program isn't just named for a woman. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2424.94s)]
*  It's largely being run by women. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2428.6600000000003s)]
*  So there's no place on launch day that I would want to be, but right here. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2432.2200000000003s)]
*  Charlie Blackwell Thompson is NASA's first female launch director. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2437.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm launch director Coppies. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2441.98s)]
*  In a year or so, she'll give the go-for-launch command for the first Artemis moon rocket [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2443.82s)]
*  in historic Firing Room 1 at Kennedy Space Center, which she first visited more than [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2449.22s)]
*  30 years ago as a college graduate interviewing for a job. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2454.5s)]
*  It's the same room that the Apollo 11 mission was launched from, and it is the same room [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2459.18s)]
*  that we will launch the first flight of the Artemis missions. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2464.58s)]
*  When that young woman walked in here for the first time, did you truly say to yourself, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2469.14s)]
*  I want to do this one day? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2475.9s)]
*  I absolutely did. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2479.2599999999998s)]
*  My thought was, how do I get a seat in this room? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2481.46s)]
*  And now you have the seat in the room. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2485.54s)]
*  I have a pretty nice seat in this room. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2489.62s)]
*  All the Apollo moon missions were launched atop huge Saturn V rockets. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2494.62s)]
*  At the time, the most powerful in the world, NASA's new rocket is even more muscular. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2501.7s)]
*  Can you put it into words how powerful this new rocket is? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2507.3399999999997s)]
*  The core stage will have hundreds of thousands of gallons of propellant, over 8 million pounds [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2512.54s)]
*  of thrust at liftoff. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2519.8199999999997s)]
*  The most powerful rocket ever is called the Space Launch System, or SLS. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2522.06s)]
*  In development for a decade, it has yet to fly and has only fired its four main engines [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2527.72s)]
*  once in a test. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2533.02s)]
*  It is hard work cheating gravity. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2540.2599999999998s)]
*  Jodi Singer is another female first for NASA. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2542.1s)]
*  As the first woman to run Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, it's been her job to build [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2545.38s)]
*  the SLS, which is designed to go to the moon and beyond. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2550.96s)]
*  It is built for going to deep space. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2555.92s)]
*  And right now, it's the only vehicle that exists that can carry the Orion and take what [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2558.76s)]
*  it does to be able to go to deep space. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2564.04s)]
*  The Orion is the capsule that astronauts will ride on top of the SLS rocket. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2566.96s)]
*  The first one is ready to go. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2573.84s)]
*  The lunar lander is still in the concept stage, but NASA doesn't really need it until the [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2576.12s)]
*  third Artemis Moon mission. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2581.3399999999997s)]

*  Artemis 2 is about the incorporation of the crew and preparing us for Artemis 3, where [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2589.16s)]
*  then we will go to the surface of the moon. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2596.6s)]
*  Do you hear yourself now how cool that sounds? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2598.92s)]
*  It does sound pretty cool. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2602.24s)]
*  Another cool piece of the Artemis plan is a space station called Gateway meant to orbit [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2604.56s)]
*  the moon. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2609.68s)]

*  providers. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2638.04s)]
*  We work together, and I think working together, that is how we will be able to deliver on [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2639.16s)]
*  the Artemis program. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2644.8799999999997s)]

*  On the International Space Station, why the moon? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2747.24s)]
*  Why put out the expense to return to the moon? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2751.04s)]
*  We are still learning from the samples that were returned during the Apollo program. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2755.0s)]
*  There is so much science, so much scientific discovery to come from returning to the moon. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2759.64s)]
*  Scientists are especially tantalized by recent evidence that there's a lot of ice near the [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2766.9199999999996s)]
*  moon's south pole. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2771.52s)]
*  That's exactly where Artemis is meant to land. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2773.4399999999996s)]
*  Space means H2O, which means water to sustain life and hydrogen and oxygen to potentially [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2776.64s)]
*  turn into rocket fuel. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2783.3599999999997s)]
*  I would point to the moon being a proving ground, a waypoint for us to learn how to [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2785.24s)]
*  live in deep space when we're only days from home versus months or years for destinations [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2792.4s)]

*  can stay. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2810.2999999999997s)]
*  Laurie Garver was the number two official at NASA during much of the Obama administration. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2811.2999999999997s)]
*  She wants America back on the moon, but believes the current approach is the wrong way to get [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2816.94s)]
*  there. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2822.22s)]
*  I would not have recommended the government build a $27 billion rocket when the private [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2823.22s)]
*  sector is building rockets nearly as large for no cost to the taxpayer. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2830.02s)]
*  She's talking about rockets like Elon Musk's Falcon Heavy. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2838.66s)]
*  Garver was an early advocate of turning all the development of big new rockets over to [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2844.1s)]
*  private companies like SpaceX. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2848.58s)]
*  But the Congress had a different goal. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2851.2599999999998s)]
*  Their goal was really to extend the contracts and jobs in their districts. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2854.04s)]
*  At the time, 2010, the space shuttle was about to be grounded. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2860.04s)]
*  And members of Congress feared that aerospace jobs in their districts would go away too. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2865.64s)]
*  The SLS, the Space Launch System, is mockingly referred to as the Senate Launch System. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2871.44s)]
*  Can you explain to us why? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2881.0s)]
*  It's got that nickname? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2882.32s)]
*  In this case, it was the Senate who came to us at NASA and said, no, we don't like your [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2883.44s)]
*  plan and we are going to make you build it this way. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2890.04s)]
*  So Boeing, prime contractor for the space shuttle and longtime NASA partner, became [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2895.08s)]
*  the prime contractor for the SLS. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2900.2400000000002s)]
*  The industry said they would do it for $6 billion in six years. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2903.32s)]
*  That was the rocket. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2908.84s)]
*  $6.2 billion in 11 years. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2909.84s)]
*  NASA's Jody Singer acknowledges the delays and cost overruns, but insists it's the right [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2914.36s)]
*  model. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2920.0s)]
*  The Space Launch System, I'm proud to say, has work that's over 45 states and over 1,100 [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2921.0s)]
*  vendors. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2927.84s)]
*  So the Space Launch System is a national vehicle. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2928.84s)]
*  That means jobs. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2932.5s)]
*  That means that across the nation, for the SLS alone, there's over 25,000 people that [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2934.06s)]
*  have jobs. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2939.52s)]
*  It's ironic, honestly, that NASA, the very symbol of a democratic and capitalist society, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2941.08s)]
*  has done a lot of its human spaceflight programs in more of a socialist way. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2952.2s)]
*  More in a socialist way. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2957.24s)]
*  I think many of the senators whose districts are getting these NASA jobs would balk at [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2959.7599999999998s)]
*  that description. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2964.84s)]
*  You will plant the potatoes in March. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2968.16s)]
*  You will build your rocket in my district. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2971.7599999999998s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2975.56s)]
*  The top-down approach, Garver says, has produced a NASA SLS rocket that will cost more than [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2977.2799999999997s)]
*  $2 billion for every launch. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2983.12s)]
*  Falcon Heavy is headed to space. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2985.7599999999998s)]
*  While SpaceX flies its Falcon Heavy for a fraction of that. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2988.44s)]
*  NASA's SLS can launch a heavier payload, but it's a use-it-and-lose-it rocket. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2993.36s)]
*  None of its parts can be reused. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=2998.6800000000003s)]
*  By contrast, SpaceX booster rockets make soft landings after launch so they can be [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3002.4s)]
*  used over and over. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3008.2400000000002s)]
*  Two of its first stages have already been launched eight times each. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3011.4s)]
*  Am I missing something in saying that this is the new way and what's going on with NASA [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3016.6400000000003s)]
*  is the old way? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3020.92s)]
*  Well, I probably wouldn't characterize it as the new way and the old way. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3022.2000000000003s)]
*  I would probably characterize it as just different ways. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3026.08s)]
*  I would say that our rocket was designed based on proven technology. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3029.48s)]
*  So you wouldn't say it's old, it's proven? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3034.44s)]
*  I would say it's proven. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3037.16s)]
*  Still, the SpaceX rockets are proven enough. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3038.76s)]
*  Godspeed, bottom dog! [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3042.2400000000002s)]
*  That NASA now trusts them to carry its astronauts to the International Space Station. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3044.52s)]
*  Welcome to the space station. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3049.56s)]
*  Those successful missions should not be confused with an entirely new rocket called Starship [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3051.48s)]
*  that SpaceX is testing in Texas. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3056.7200000000003s)]
*  Three test flights so far, all three ending in spectacular explosions. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3059.52s)]
*  The latest one just last week. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3066.28s)]
*  So should NASA pivot and start relying on SpaceX and commercial launchers for the moon [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3069.56s)]
*  and beyond? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3078.6800000000003s)]
*  Undoubtedly. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3080.48s)]
*  We should have before now. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3081.48s)]
*  Is NASA capable of making that shift? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3084.08s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3087.84s)]
*  I mean, NASA is capable of more than they realize. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3089.2000000000003s)]
*  Now considering all you have told me, will Congress let NASA make that shift? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3094.56s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3104.2000000000003s)]
*  For the moment, the core stage for the first Artemis mission sits in a test stand in Mississippi, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3105.52s)]
*  the same stand used for the Apollo missions. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3111.44s)]
*  It's awaiting a test firing after technical glitches cut the first one short. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3114.64s)]
*  There are six American flags on the moon, one for each Apollo landing. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3121.4s)]
*  But the newest flag there is Chinese, left last year by a robotic lander that collected [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3126.64s)]
*  samples and brought them back to Earth. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3132.64s)]
*  Beijing eventually plans to send astronauts. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3135.16s)]
*  Aren't we in a space race with China? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3138.8399999999997s)]
*  There's not a race to go the moon. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3141.3999999999996s)]
*  We won it. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3142.7999999999997s)]
*  We won it six times. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3144.8399999999997s)]
*  And I have no doubt that we will be back again with people before anyone else goes. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3146.7999999999997s)]
*  And Charlie Blackwell Thompson will be the woman to launch them from her seat in the [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3152.96s)]
*  firing room. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3157.6s)]
*  We talk a lot about the moon. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3159.3599999999997s)]
*  And I think the moon is phenomenal. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3161.42s)]
*  And I can't wait to go back. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3164.32s)]
*  But when we talk about those young people that may be like me when I was younger, looking [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3166.7200000000003s)]

*  over on its side. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3200.3199999999997s)]
*  Even so, it's the first American spacecraft to land on the moon in more than 50 years. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3202.3599999999997s)]
*  NASA has a much more ambitious lunar program called Artemis, which aims to send people [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3208.68s)]
*  back to the moon, to establish an outpost at the south pole, and to push on from there [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3214.7999999999997s)]
*  to Mars. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3220.24s)]
*  We previewed Artemis here in 2021. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3221.7999999999997s)]
*  But there are significant questions now about the program's costs and its timetable. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3225.0s)]
*  In January, NASA announced its new target for a manned landing, late 2026, a year later [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3230.52s)]
*  than planned. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3237.36s)]
*  But as we discovered, even that may be unrealistic. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3238.78s)]
*  When Artemis 1 soared into space in November of 2022, it was the beginning of a nearly [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3247.52s)]
*  flawless mission. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3254.28s)]
*  In its first test flight, NASA's new Space Launch System rocket sent an empty Orion crew [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3257.7200000000003s)]
*  capsule on a 1.4 million mile flyby of the moon before a picture-perfect return to Earth. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3264.64s)]
*  The next flight, Artemis 2, meant to carry four astronauts on a lunar flyby, was supposed [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3273.2s)]
*  to launch this year. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3279.44s)]
*  And then, a year later, Artemis 3 would land the first woman and first person of color [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3281.12s)]
*  on the moon. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3286.78s)]
*  It's not working out quite that way. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3288.44s)]
*  I think it is safe to say without significant reductions in costs, better cost controls, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3291.7599999999998s)]
*  better planning, the Artemis program on its current trajectory is not sustainable. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3297.44s)]

*  to Earth, particularly when it comes to costs. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3317.72s)]
*  Right now, we're estimating that per launch, the Artemis campaign will cost $4.2 billion [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3321.6s)]
*  per launch. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3327.88s)]
*  Per launch. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3328.88s)]
*  Per launch. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3329.88s)]
*  That's an incredible amount of money per launch. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3330.88s)]
*  A lot of that hardware is just going to end up in the ocean never to be used again. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3332.88s)]
*  The Inspector General for NASA says that the costs for the Artemis program are simply unsustainable. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3336.7599999999998s)]
*  Is he wrong? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3345.56s)]
*  We didn't necessarily agree with their conclusions. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3346.8399999999997s)]
*  We feel like we've taken an affordable path to do these missions. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3350.36s)]
*  Jim Free is NASA's Associate Administrator and directly in charge of Artemis. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3356.6800000000003s)]
*  We met him at historic Launch Pad 39B, from which both Apollo and Artemis rockets have [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3362.52s)]
*  flown. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3369.56s)]
*  We believe that the rocket we have is best matched for the mission and frankly the only [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3370.7000000000003s)]
*  one in the world that can take crews to the moon. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3375.7200000000003s)]
*  But as George Scott said, most components of that SLS rocket end up in the ocean. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3379.08s)]
*  They're not reusable. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3388.16s)]
*  And with the goal of building an outpost on the moon, Artemis will need a lot of those [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3389.92s)]
*  $4.2 billion rockets. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3395.44s)]
*  It's going to take launch after launch after launch to get all that stuff up there. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3398.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3403.36s)]
*  The number of launches is daunting, but it's hard to get people to the moon. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3404.36s)]
*  When America sent Neil Armstrong and 11 more astronauts to the moon a half century ago, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3414.1200000000003s)]
*  they got to the lunar surface aboard Landers, owned and operated by NASA. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3421.52s)]
*  We're taking a different approach this time than with Apollo. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3432.3199999999997s)]
*  What's the difference this time? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3436.96s)]
*  The difference is we're buying it as a service. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3438.44s)]
*  We're paying someone to take our crews down and take them up. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3441.64s)]
*  That someone is Elon Musk. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3446.88s)]
*  In 2021, NASA signed a nearly $3 billion contract with his SpaceX to use its new Starship mega [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3449.62s)]
*  rocket as the lunar lander for the first Artemis astronauts. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3457.6s)]
*  It is by far the biggest flying object ever made. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3462.44s)]
*  SpaceX is preparing for its third Starship launch atop its enormous Super Heavy booster. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3469.7999999999997s)]
*  The first two launches both ended in roughly the same way. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3476.24s)]
*  As you can see, the Super Heavy booster has just experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3481.96s)]
*  Rapid unscheduled disassembly is SpaceX speak for our Starship rocket just blew up again. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3488.48s)]
*  And now you've seen some of the perils of relying on SpaceX. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3496.68s)]
*  We've seen some of the challenges they've had on Starship. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3501.68s)]
*  We need them to launch several times to give us the confidence that we can put our crews [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3504.88s)]
*  on there. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3509.84s)]
*  Right now, as we sit here today, you have no way of getting the astronauts to the surface [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3510.92s)]
*  of the moon because of these problems that SpaceX has faced. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3516.2400000000002s)]
*  Because they haven't hit the technical milestones. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3520.86s)]
*  SpaceX's stated plan is to first put its Starship lander into low Earth orbit, then launch ten [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3524.48s)]
*  more Starship tankers to pump rocket fuel into the lander in space. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3530.6400000000003s)]
*  Make sci-fi real. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3536.6400000000003s)]
*  We're sending it onward to meet astronauts in lunar orbit. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3539.48s)]
*  And this has never been done before. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3543.28s)]
*  There's been small scale transfers in orbit, but not of this magnitude. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3545.68s)]
*  It just sounds incredibly complicated. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3550.28s)]
*  It is complicated. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3554.0s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3555.2s)]
*  It's that you don't, you just launch ten times kind of on a whim. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3556.2s)]
*  It's never been done before. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3559.96s)]
*  Chances are it's going to take longer than you think to do it and to do it successfully [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3560.96s)]
*  and improve that technology before we trust putting humans on it. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3566.24s)]
*  There's a long way to go. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3570.8399999999997s)]
*  NASA's contract with SpaceX requires the company to make an unmanned lunar landing with Starship [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3573.56s)]
*  before trying one with astronauts on board. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3579.2799999999997s)]
*  But NASA still says the manned mission can happen in two and a half years. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3582.66s)]
*  That just seems like the time frame we're talking about, the end of 2026, seems ambitious [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3588.3199999999997s)]
*  to say the least. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3594.24s)]
*  What we're doing is ambitious, but it's a great goal to have. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3595.72s)]
*  Is that goal realistic? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3599.16s)]
*  I believe it is. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3600.52s)]
*  I believe it is. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3601.52s)]
*  Jim Frey's optimism is based on SpaceX's track record with its smaller Falcon rocket. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3605.3599999999997s)]
*  Once it got the Falcon up and running, it demonstrated it can launch a lot, 96 times [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3613.64s)]
*  last year alone with both commercial and government payloads. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3619.7999999999997s)]
*  But so far Starship has yet to reach orbit even once. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3624.2s)]
*  Does that concern you that that's going to keep pushing that timeline back further? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3629.04s)]
*  Of course it absolutely concerns me because we need them to launch multiple times. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3632.7999999999997s)]
*  SpaceX ignored our multiple requests for an interview or comment, but in an interview [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3637.2799999999997s)]
*  with the Daily Wire in January, Elon Musk said this. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3642.3999999999996s)]
*  We're hoping to have the first humans on the moon in less than five years. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3647.28s)]
*  My view of that is we have a contract with SpaceX that says they're going to launch our [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3655.6000000000004s)]
*  crew in the end of 2026. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3660.52s)]
*  Why does it really matter when we get back to the moon? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3663.92s)]
*  Here's why. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3667.32s)]
*  China has said it plans to send its taikonauts to the moon by the end of the decade, and [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3668.44s)]
*  NASA Administrator Bill Nelson has publicly expressed concern. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3674.08s)]
*  Naturally, I don't want China to get to the South Pole first with humans and then say, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3678.96s)]
*  this is ours. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3688.88s)]
*  Stay out. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3690.88s)]
*  To ensure that the U.S. will plant its flag first, NASA signed a new $3 billion contract [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3693.72s)]
*  last year with Blue Origin, the space company owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, to build [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3702.2000000000003s)]
*  another lunar lander. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3707.76s)]
*  And Jim Free is crystal clear that he sees it as an option if SpaceX starships keep [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3709.7200000000003s)]
*  blowing up. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3715.52s)]
*  If we have a problem with one, we'll have another one to rely on. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3716.6400000000003s)]
*  If we have a dependency on a particular aspect in SpaceX or Blue Origin and it doesn't work [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3721.0s)]
*  out, then we have another lander that can take our crews. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3726.84s)]
*  In this battle of the stargazing billionaires, Bezos' Blue Origin has far fewer launches [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3730.66s)]
*  than Musk's SpaceX and has been far quieter about its ambitions until now. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3736.58s)]
*  So what we're looking to do is not only get to the moon and back, but make it reliable [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3743.14s)]
*  and repeatable and low cost. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3748.02s)]
*  John Kolouris' title at Blue Origin is Senior Vice President of Lunar Permanence, and it [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3749.9s)]
*  says a lot about the company's ambition. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3755.9s)]
*  The landers that Blue Origin is going to be building are reusable. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3758.78s)]
*  We'll launch them to lunar orbit and we'll leave them there and we'll refuel them in [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3762.46s)]
*  orbit so that multiple astronauts can use the same vehicle back and forth. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3766.78s)]
*  Our cameras were among the first to be allowed inside Blue Origin's huge complex in Florida, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3772.98s)]
*  just next to Kennedy Space Center. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3779.42s)]
*  This is where the future is being built. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3782.1800000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3785.3s)]
*  This is the main factory floor for the New Glenn rocket. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3786.3s)]
*  New Glenn is Blue Origin's first heavy lift rocket. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3789.5800000000004s)]
*  Its maiden launch will be sometime this year. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3793.7400000000002s)]
*  So you can see over here we have three different second stages already in build here. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3797.38s)]
*  The first New Glenn is already out at Blue Origin's launch complex. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3802.46s)]
*  It's designed to carry all sorts of payloads, including the lunar lander being built for NASA. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3807.02s)]
*  So this is the Mark I lander. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3813.82s)]
*  We call this our small lander. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3815.92s)]
*  This is the small one? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3817.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3818.84s)]
*  It's actually a mock-up of their cargo lander in Blue Origin's Florida lobby. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3819.84s)]
*  John Koloris used to work at SpaceX and he came over to Blue to help speed things up. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3825.32s)]
*  Is there a bit of a space race between you and SpaceX? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3831.7000000000003s)]
*  So the country needs competition. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3836.46s)]
*  We need options. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3840.62s)]
*  Competition brings innovation. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3842.56s)]
*  You haven't had anything close to the accomplishments that SpaceX has had at this point, have you? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3845.2000000000003s)]
*  SpaceX has done some amazing things and they've changed the narrative for access to space. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3854.28s)]
*  And Blue Origin is looking to do the same. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3859.04s)]
*  This lander, we're expecting to land on the moon between 12 and 16 months from today. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3861.2000000000003s)]
*  12 and 16 months from today? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3868.32s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3870.88s)]
*  I understand I'm saying that publicly, but that's what our team is aiming towards. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3871.88s)]
*  But that's for the cargo lander. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3876.4s)]
*  What about humans? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3879.4s)]
*  For humans, we're working with NASA on the Artemis V mission. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3881.0s)]
*  That's planned for 2029. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3885.12s)]
*  That's not so different from Elon Musk's forecast of when SpaceX can land humans back on the [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3887.78s)]
*  moon, even if it doesn't match NASA's. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3892.92s)]
*  Like the Starship, Blue Origin's lander will require in-space refueling, but Kulluris insists [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3896.3199999999997s)]

*  Our new Glenn vehicle will be a reusable vehicle from its first mission. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3907.56s)]
*  That lander for the astronauts is a reusable lander. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3912.08s)]
*  So now you're not just taking the equipment and throwing it away. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3915.56s)]
*  You're reusing it for the next mission. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3918.62s)]
*  You do it again and again and again. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3920.4799999999996s)]
*  Is that where the cost savings comes in? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3922.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3924.24s)]
*  We are now building with NASA the infrastructure to ensure lunar permanency. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3925.24s)]
*  You have said that the Artemis program is the beginning, not the end. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3931.3599999999997s)]
*  Tell me, what is the future you see? [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3936.68s)]
*  I see us landing on Mars. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3939.3199999999997s)]
*  Absolutely see us landing on Mars. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3942.6s)]
*  But we have to work through the moon to get to Mars. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3944.2799999999997s)]
*  These are magnificent goals. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3947.72s)]
*  Going back to the moon, going to Mars. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3951.02s)]
*  Do we have the ability to do what we're dreaming of doing? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3954.12s)]
*  You know, this is NASA. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3957.3999999999996s)]
*  Right? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3959.64s)]
*  This agency is destined to continue to do great things. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3960.64s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3963.4399999999996s)]
*  What we're telling the agency is just be more realistic. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3965.2s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with being optimistic. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3967.7599999999998s)]
*  In fact, it's required. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3968.9599999999996s)]
*  Right? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3970.2s)]
*  In this business, optimism is required. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3971.2s)]
*  The question is though, can you also be more realistic? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3973.04s)]
*  For a long time, astronomers saw the asteroids and comets that come close to Earth as useless [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3984.72s)]
*  debris, space rocks that blocked our view of distant galaxies. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3989.64s)]
*  Not anymore. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3993.8399999999997s)]
*  They're now viewed as scientifically important and potentially very dangerous if they were [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3994.8399999999997s)]
*  to collide with our planet. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=3999.16s)]
*  The odds of that happening on any given day are remote, but over millions of years, scientists [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4001.08s)]
*  believe there have been lots of impacts and few doubt there are more to come. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4005.7999999999997s)]
*  A former astronaut told us it's like a game of cosmic roulette and one mankind cannot [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4010.88s)]
*  afford to lose. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4016.7200000000003s)]
*  Concern over our ability to detect these objects that come near the Earth grew after an incident [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4018.6400000000003s)]
*  in Russia this February when an asteroid crashed into the atmosphere with many times the energy [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4023.84s)]
*  of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, narrowly missing a city of one million. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4029.52s)]
*  This is video of that asteroid in Russia barreling toward Earth at 40,000 miles an hour. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4035.68s)]
*  It exploded into pieces 19 miles above and 25 miles south of the city of Chelyabinsk. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4042.16s)]
*  People thought it had missed them entirely until minutes later when the shockwave arrived. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4049.24s)]
*  Shattering glass, crushing doors and knocking some people right off their feet. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4057.44s)]
*  More than a thousand were injured. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4063.08s)]
*  How much warning did people in Chelyabinsk have? [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4065.32s)]
*  None. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4068.04s)]
*  Paul Chodis is a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4069.04s)]
*  He and his boss Don Yeomans have been trying to track near-Earth objects for decades. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4074.28s)]
*  We didn't see it coming. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4079.32s)]
*  It was coming from the general direction of the sun, so it was in the daytime sky as it [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4080.76s)]
*  approached. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4084.84s)]
*  So how did you find out about it? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4085.84s)]
*  Twitter and YouTube when we first saw the images. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4087.0s)]
*  So the first people at NASA heard about it was Twitter? [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4089.98s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4093.8s)]
*  Chodis says an object this size hits Earth once every hundred years on average. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4094.92s)]
*  Yet the same day, purely by chance, another asteroid twice as large came within 17,000 [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4100.12s)]
*  miles of Earth, passing between us and the satellites that are bringing you this broadcast. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4106.6s)]
*  The only reason there was any advance warning was because an amateur astronomer in Spain, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4112.1s)]
*  an oral surgeon by day, noticed it just before it moved out of view. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4117.32s)]
*  We know about some of the most distant galaxies in the known universe, and yet we don't really [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4121.96s)]
*  know everything that's right in our own backyard. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4126.12s)]
*  Amy Mainzer is a NASA scientist who focuses on detecting asteroids. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4128.56s)]
*  So we've got to move the dome out of the way, and then we're going to start to follow the [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4132.84s)]
*  asteroid as it tracks across the sky. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4137.28s)]
*  This telescope at the Table Mountain Observatory in California is one of dozens all over the [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4140.18s)]
*  world that are used to track and study near-Earth objects. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4144.8s)]
*  Mainzer told us they're often very hard to find. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4148.8s)]
*  Some of these asteroids are really, really dark, darker even than coal in some cases, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4152.400000000001s)]
*  kind of like the soot at the bottom of a barbecue grill. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4156.320000000001s)]
*  So you're looking for something that's darker than coal against a black sky. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4158.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4162.64s)]
*  And now you see the problem. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4163.64s)]
*  Another problem is that ground-based telescopes can't see objects coming from the direction [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4165.64s)]
*  of the sun because they're in the daytime sky, like the asteroid that hit Russia. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4170.08s)]
*  Scientists find asteroids by taking repeated pictures of the night sky and looking for [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4176.0s)]
*  things that change position. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4180.52s)]
*  Professionals and amateurs all over the world work together sharing information. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4182.6s)]
*  Once Paul Chodis and his NASA colleagues have multiple sightings, they can predict an object's [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4187.96s)]
*  location as far as a hundred years into the future. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4192.84s)]
*  This particular object has a very well-known orbit. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4196.72s)]
*  The asteroid Amy Mainzer was observing the night we visited didn't look like much on [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4199.36s)]
*  her screen. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4203.48s)]
*  That little thing? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4204.8s)]
*  But it's nearly half a mile wide and capable of destroying an entire continent. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4206.6s)]
*  So that's actually a huge asteroid? [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4211.8s)]
*  It's a huge asteroid. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4213.84s)]
*  If something this size hit the earth, it would be devastating. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4214.84s)]
*  It would be very bad. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4216.84s)]
*  Asteroids are composed mostly of rock, comets, ice and dust. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4219.12s)]
*  They come in all shapes and sizes. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4223.12s)]
*  Some look like small planets. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4225.88s)]
*  Others giant dog bones. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4227.96s)]
*  For a long time, nobody thought they were worth tracking at all. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4230.0s)]
*  It wasn't thought that they really did hit the earth. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4233.7s)]
*  Astronomers debated for a long time about the nature of the craters on the moon. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4237.58s)]
*  They thought the craters on the moon were volcanic? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4241.42s)]
*  Possibly, yeah. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4243.3s)]
*  And it's only been fairly recently, within the last 50 years or so, that the field has [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4244.3s)]
*  really recognized that impacts actually do happen. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4248.099999999999s)]
*  And not only do they happen on geological time scales, millions and billions of years, [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4251.54s)]
*  but on human time scales in some cases. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4257.0199999999995s)]
*  The last major asteroid to collide with earth hit in 1908 in the Tunguska region of Siberia. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4259.82s)]
*  It's believed to have been 40 yards wide and to have exploded in the air like a nuclear [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4266.139999999999s)]
*  bomb, leveling 80 million trees in an area the size of metropolitan Washington. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4270.74s)]
*  This crater in northern Arizona was created 50,000 years ago. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4277.099999999999s)]
*  It's one of more than 180 impact craters geologists have found so far. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4281.32s)]
*  They think there are many more hidden by water and vegetation, more even than on the moon [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4286.26s)]
*  because the earth's gravity is greater. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4291.780000000001s)]
*  The most famous impact of all is the one that may have wiped out the dinosaurs more than [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4294.4400000000005s)]
*  65 million years ago. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4298.740000000001s)]
*  The theory is that an enormous asteroid or comet collided so violently with earth, it [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4300.88s)]
*  created a cloud of debris that blocked out the sun, killing off 75% of all species, leaving [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4306.18s)]
*  behind a crater in Mexico more than 100 miles wide. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4312.98s)]
*  These are objects that were once in space, pieces of asteroids. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4317.419999999999s)]
*  Jomens and Chodas showed us some of the remarkable things that have fallen from the sky. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4322.259999999999s)]
*  This is a piece of Mars. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4327.54s)]
*  You have it in your hand. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4328.54s)]
*  It wandered around the inner solar system for a few million years and a 40 pound stone [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4329.54s)]
*  came down in Africa about 10 feet from a farmer in October of 1962. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4335.62s)]
*  It's amazing that this is from Mars. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4341.98s)]
*  They played a trick on me as well. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4344.259999999999s)]
*  Would you hand that one to me? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4346.099999999999s)]
*  That big one? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4347.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4348.62s)]
*  Come on. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4349.62s)]
*  This one was iron nickel and heavy as an anvil. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4352.62s)]
*  Not all asteroids are made of such dense stuff, but many contain high concentrations of valuable [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4356.179999999999s)]
*  minerals like platinum that might someday be mined in space. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4361.639999999999s)]
*  We'll start by sending astronauts to an asteroid for the first time in history. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4366.0199999999995s)]
*  President Obama's proposed budget for next year includes a plan to capture a tiny asteroid [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4370.86s)]
*  so that astronauts could rendezvous with it by 2025. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4375.46s)]
*  The idea is to perfect techniques needed to explore deep space and perhaps find a way [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4379.42s)]
*  to exploit the water resources that many comets and asteroids have. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4384.74s)]
*  You could extract water from them. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4389.5s)]
*  You can break the water down into hydrogen and oxygen, which is the most efficient form [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4391.34s)]
*  of rocket fuel. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4394.9s)]
*  Asteroids may serve as the fueling stations and watering holes for future planetary exploration. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4397.82s)]

*  or so. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4435.0599999999995s)]
*  What about the other 5%? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4436.0599999999995s)]
*  We're still looking. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4437.0599999999995s)]

*  The problem is there are lots of smaller objects over 40 yards in diameter that are unaccounted [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4445.379999999999s)]

*  Ed Liu is a former astronaut who spent six months on the International Space Station. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4457.54s)]

*  have found so far. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4471.139999999999s)]
*  These green dots are the asteroids that could hit the Earth. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4473.219999999999s)]
*  This is about the 10,000 known asteroids? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4475.92s)]
*  Yes, these are the 10,000 known asteroids. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4478.5s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4480.66s)]
*  There's about a factor of 100 more. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4481.74s)]
*  The real solar system looks like this. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4483.0199999999995s)]
*  We know this because we've only been able to observe a small fraction of the sky and [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4485.74s)]
*  we know that there's about 100 times more asteroids than we've found. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4489.98s)]
*  This is all the asteroids that are... [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4492.34s)]
*  There are about a million asteroids large enough to destroy a city out there. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4493.82s)]
*  And right now we only know of what percent of those asteroids? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4497.34s)]
*  About one-half of 1%. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4501.139999999999s)]
*  Does it worry you that you only know 1% of these asteroids that are big enough to destroy [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4503.139999999999s)]
*  a city? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4508.66s)]
*  Well, most of those are really small and the odds are that many of these would hit in a [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4509.66s)]
*  remote area or could hit in an ocean. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4513.46s)]
*  So that is why the larger ones are those that we were paying attention to first. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4517.3s)]
*  Now the next size range is the one to concentrate on, those that can cause continent-wide extinction [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4522.02s)]
*  or destruction. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4527.62s)]
*  Yeah, that would be pretty good to prevent that. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4529.62s)]
*  Continent-wide destruction? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4533.18s)]
*  Those are the next ones. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4535.36s)]
*  We'll continue to find those and we work our way down to the small ones. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4536.36s)]
*  Right now, an object that could wipe out the eastern seaboard or New York City could be [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4541.62s)]
*  a day away and there's a very good chance we wouldn't know about it. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4548.86s)]
*  Well, we're working to make sure that we will know about it. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4552.3s)]
*  But right now we wouldn't know about it. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4554.78s)]
*  It's possible. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4556.54s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4557.54s)]
*  The Committee on Science, Space and Technology will come to order. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4558.54s)]
*  NASA Administrator Charles Bolden faced similar questions from Congress after the near-miss [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4562.139999999999s)]
*  in Russia earlier this year. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4567.0199999999995s)]
*  What would we do? [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4569.259999999999s)]
*  If you detected even a small one, like the one that detonated in Russia, headed for New [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4571.14s)]
*  York City in three weeks, what would we do? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4578.860000000001s)]
*  If it's coming in three weeks, pray. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4581.9800000000005s)]
*  Is there anything you can do to deflect an asteroid that's going to hit besides evacuating [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4585.280000000001s)]
*  a city? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4590.14s)]
*  If you find it 10 or 20 or 30 years in advance, then yes, you could actually send a spacecraft [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4591.14s)]
*  up, run into it, slow it down a millimeter or two per second so that in 10 or 20 years [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4596.78s)]
*  when it was predicted to hit the earth, it wouldn't. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4602.099999999999s)]
*  Just slam a spacecraft into it. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4604.66s)]
*  Just slam into it. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4605.9s)]
*  In 2005, NASA did just that as an experiment, firing a small unmanned spacecraft into a [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4606.9s)]
*  comet called Temple 1. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4613.5s)]
*  But you can't deflect what you don't detect, which is why former astronaut Ed Lew has taken [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4615.74s)]
*  on a new mission. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4621.08s)]
*  Here's the telescope that we're building. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4622.66s)]
*  He's now chairman of the B612 Foundation, which has designed a space-based telescope [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4624.02s)]
*  to speed up the discovery of near-earth objects. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4629.26s)]
*  NASA's Amy Manzer has been developing one too. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4632.820000000001s)]
*  Both telescopes would be able to find asteroids by using infrared sensors that detect heat [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4635.780000000001s)]
*  rather than light. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4641.46s)]
*  But a telescope like this would cost roughly half a billion dollars, and so far neither [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4643.14s)]
*  the United States nor any other government has committed significant funds. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4647.540000000001s)]
*  The B612 Foundation is trying to raise the money privately by reaching out to individual [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4651.9s)]
*  donors. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4657.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't think there's any other global catastrophe, global scale catastrophe that we can prevent. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4658.0199999999995s)]
*  This is the only one that I know of. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4664.5s)]
*  We can solve this particular issue for the cost of building a freeway overpass. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4666.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's literally what it is. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4670.299999999999s)]
*  But nobody has been killed by an asteroid. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4672.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4675.299999999999s)]
*  And what I'm saying is that you can't wait till that point afterwards when you say we [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4676.299999999999s)]
*  should have done it. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4679.62s)]
*  You have to think of this as cosmic roulette, right? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4680.8s)]
*  The phrase that they have in Vegas is that the house always wins. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4683.24s)]
*  And the sort of secret to all this is that we're not the house. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4686.52s)]
*  At some point, the solar system's going to get you. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4690.84s)]
*  They're very low probability events, but very high consequence events. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4694.76s)]
*  The problem, it seems like, is you're asking people to care about something which may not [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4698.68s)]
*  affect their lives, may not even affect their children's lives. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4704.0s)]
*  That's true. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4708.2s)]
*  It's a difficult concept to get across because, as you say, it's something that may not happen [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4709.2s)]
*  for another 100 years, 200 years. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4713.0199999999995s)]
*  It may happen tomorrow morning. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4715.4s)]
*  Earlier this summer, the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense released [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4727.639999999999s)]

*  Aerial Phenomena, or UAP, more commonly known as UFOs. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4739.28s)]
*  The government's grudging acknowledgement of 144 mysterious sightings documented by [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4745.16s)]
*  our military comes after decades of public denial. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4750.6s)]
*  But as we first reported in May, whatever is trespassing in our skies and seas poses [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4754.88s)]
*  a serious safety risk to our servicemen and women, as well as our national security. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4760.7s)]
*  So what you're telling me is that UFOs, unidentified flying objects, are real? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4767.62s)]
*  Bill, I think we're beyond that already. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4776.94s)]
*  The government has already stated for the record that they're real. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4779.46s)]
*  I'm not telling you that. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4781.78s)]
*  The United States government is telling you that. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4782.78s)]
*  Luis Elizondo spent 20 years running military intelligence operations worldwide in Afghanistan, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4785.42s)]
*  the Middle East and Guantanamo. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4792.14s)]
*  He hadn't given UFOs a second thought until 2008. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4794.64s)]
*  That's when he was asked to join something at the Pentagon called the Advanced Aerospace [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4798.9400000000005s)]
*  Threat Identification Program, or ATIP. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4803.46s)]
*  The mission of ATIP was quite simple. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4807.26s)]
*  It was to collect and analyze information involving anomalous aerial vehicles. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4808.9s)]
*  But I guess in the vernacular you call them UFOs. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4814.62s)]
*  We call them UAPs. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4817.42s)]
*  You know how this sounds. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4819.099999999999s)]
*  It sounds nutty, wacky. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4820.599999999999s)]
*  Look, Bill, I'm not telling you that it doesn't sound wacky. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4822.86s)]
*  What I'm telling you is real. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4827.26s)]
*  The question is, what is it? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4828.76s)]
*  What are its intentions? [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4830.5s)]
*  What are its capabilities? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4831.5s)]
*  Buried away in the Pentagon, ATIP was part of a $22 million program sponsored by then [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4833.42s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to investigate UFOs. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4840.419999999999s)]
*  When Elizondo took over in 2010, he focused on the national security implications of unidentified [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4844.82s)]
*  aerial phenomena documented by U.S. service members. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4851.379999999999s)]
*  Imagine a technology that can do 600 to 700 G-forces, that can fly at 13,000 miles an [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4856.099999999999s)]
*  hour, that can evade radar, and that can fly through air and water and possibly space, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4861.82s)]
*  and oh, by the way, has no obvious signs of propulsion, no wings, no control surfaces, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4870.219999999999s)]

*  That's precisely what we're seeing. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4878.5s)]
*  Elizondo tells us ATIP was a loose-knit mix of scientists, electro-optical engineers, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4880.099999999999s)]
*  avionics and intelligence experts, often working part-time. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4886.58s)]
*  They combed through data and records and analyzed videos like this. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4890.9s)]
*  A Navy aircrew struggles to lock on to a fast-moving object off the U.S. Atlantic coast in 2015. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4900.78s)]
*  Recently released images may not convince UFO skeptics, but the Pentagon admits it [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4910.42s)]
*  doesn't know what in the world this is. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4915.94s)]
*  Or this. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4920.38s)]
*  Or this. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4921.38s)]
*  So what do you say to the skeptics? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4922.38s)]
*  It's refracted light, weather balloons, a rocket being launched, Venus. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4925.54s)]
*  In some cases, there are simple explanations for what people are witnessing, but there [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4932.98s)]
*  are some that are not. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4938.5s)]
*  We're not just simply jumping to a conclusion that's saying, oh, that's a UAP out there. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4941.78s)]
*  We're going through our due diligence. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4945.94s)]
*  Is it some sort of new type of cruise missile technology that China has developed? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4947.42s)]
*  Is it some sort of high-altitude balloon that's conducting reconnaissance? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4951.3s)]
*  Ultimately, when you have exhausted all those what-ifs and you're still left with the fact [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4955.66s)]
*  that this is in our airspace and it's real, that's when it becomes compelling and that's [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4961.74s)]
*  when it becomes problematic. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4967.14s)]
*  Former Navy pilot Lieutenant Ryan Graves calls whatever is out there a security risk. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4969.46s)]
*  He told us his F-18 squadron began seeing UAPs hovering over restricted airspace southeast [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4976.1s)]
*  of Virginia Beach in 2014 when they updated their jet's radar, making it possible to zero [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4983.1s)]
*  in with infrared targeting cameras. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4989.54s)]
*  So you're seeing it both with the radar and with the infrared and that tells you that [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4992.3s)]
*  there is something out there. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=4997.580000000001s)]
*  Pretty hard to spoof that. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5000.38s)]
*  These photographs were taken in 2019 in the same area. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5002.02s)]
*  The Pentagon confirms these are images of objects it can't identify. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5006.18s)]
*  Lieutenant Graves told us pilots training off the Atlantic coast see things like that [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5011.38s)]
*  all the time. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5016.5s)]
*  Every day. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5018.5s)]
*  Every day for at least a couple of years. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5019.860000000001s)]
*  Wait a minute, every day for a couple of years? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5022.22s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5024.580000000001s)]
*  I don't see an exhaust. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5025.580000000001s)]
*  Including this one, off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida in 2015 captured on a targeting camera [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5027.5s)]
*  by members of Graves' squadron. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5033.98s)]
*  Look at this thing. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5035.98s)]
*  It's rotating. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5037.98s)]
*  My gosh. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5039.98s)]
*  They're all going against the wind. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5041.98s)]
*  The wind's 120 knots to the west. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5043.98s)]
*  The whole thing, dude. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5045.98s)]
*  You can sort of hear a surprise in their voices. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5047.98s)]
*  You certainly can. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5049.98s)]
*  They seem to have broke character a bit and were just kind of amazed at what they were seeing. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5050.98s)]
*  What do you think when you see something like this? [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5056.459999999999s)]
*  This is a difficult one to explain. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5059.0599999999995s)]
*  You have rotation. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5061.0599999999995s)]
*  You have high altitudes. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5062.259999999999s)]
*  You have propulsion, right? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5063.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5064.74s)]
*  I don't know what it is, frankly. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5065.74s)]
*  He told us pilots speculate they are one of three things, secret U.S. technology, an [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5068.0599999999995s)]
*  adversary spy vehicle, or something otherworldly. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5074.419999999999s)]
*  I'd say, you know, the highest probability is it's a threat observation program. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5078.339999999999s)]
*  Is there going to be Russian or Chinese technology? [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5083.74s)]
*  I don't see why not. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5087.219999999999s)]
*  Are you alarmed? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5088.219999999999s)]
*  I am worried, frankly. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5089.82s)]
*  You know, if these were tactical jets from another country that were hanging out up there, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5092.099999999999s)]
*  it would be a massive issue. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5094.94s)]
*  But because it looks slightly different, we're not willing to actually look at the problem [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5096.9s)]
*  in the face. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5100.099999999999s)]
*  We're happy to just ignore the fact that these are out there watching us every day. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5102.099999999999s)]
*  The government has ignored it, at least publicly, since closing its Project Blue Book investigation [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5106.58s)]
*  in 1969. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5111.74s)]
*  But that began to change after an incident off Southern California in 2004, which was [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5113.5s)]
*  documented by radar, by camera and four naval aviators. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5118.9s)]
*  We spoke to two of them, David Fravor, a graduate of the Top Gun Naval Flight School and commander [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5124.02s)]
*  of the F-18 Squadron on the USS Nimitz and flying at his wing, Lieutenant Alex Dietrich, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5130.26s)]
*  who has never spoken publicly about the encounter. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5136.9s)]
*  I never wanted to be on national TV. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5140.46s)]
*  No offense. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5143.02s)]
*  So why are you doing this? [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5144.02s)]
*  Because I was in a government aircraft, because I was on the clock. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5146.1s)]
*  And so I feel a responsibility to share what I can, and it is unclassified. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5150.18s)]
*  It was November 2004, and the USS Nimitz carrier strike group was training about 100 miles [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5155.42s)]
*  southwest of San Diego. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5164.22s)]
*  For a week, the advanced new radar on a nearby ship, the USS Princeton, had detected what [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5166.42s)]
*  operators called multiple anomalous aerial vehicles over the horizon, descending 80,000 [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5172.3s)]
*  feet in less than a second. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5178.7s)]
*  On November 14, Fravor and Dietrich, each with a weapons system officer in the backseat, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5182.46s)]
*  were diverted to investigate. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5188.18s)]
*  They found an area of roiling whitewater the size of a 737 in an otherwise calm blue sea. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5190.94s)]
*  So as we're looking at this, her backseater says, hey, skipper, do you? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5199.0599999999995s)]
*  And about that got out, I said, dude, do you see that thing down there? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5205.62s)]
*  And we saw this little white, tic-tac-looking object, and it's just kind of moving above [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5209.099999999999s)]
*  the whitewater area. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5213.94s)]
*  As Dietrich circled above, Fravor went in for a closer look. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5215.46s)]
*  Sort of spiraling down? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5220.3s)]
*  Yep. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5221.3s)]
*  The tic-tac still pointing north-south, it goes, and just turns abruptly and starts mirroring [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5222.3s)]
*  me. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5227.5s)]
*  So as I'm coming down, it starts coming up. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5228.5s)]
*  So it's mimicking your moves. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5230.18s)]
*  Yeah, it was aware we were there. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5231.900000000001s)]
*  He said it was about the size of his F-18, with no markings, no wings, no exhaust plumes. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5233.740000000001s)]
*  I'll see how close I can get. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5239.9400000000005s)]
*  So I go like this, and it's climbing still. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5242.26s)]
*  And when it gets right in front of me, it just disappears. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5244.46s)]
*  Disappears? [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5247.780000000001s)]
*  Disappears. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5248.780000000001s)]
*  Gone. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5249.82s)]
*  It had sped off. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5250.82s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5251.82s)]
*  So your mind tries to make sense of it. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5253.78s)]
*  I'm going to categorize this as maybe a helicopter or maybe a drone. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5256.0599999999995s)]
*  And when it disappeared, I mean, it was just... [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5261.62s)]
*  Did your backseaters see this too? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5264.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5266.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5267.179999999999s)]
*  There was four of us in the airplanes literally watching this thing for roughly about five [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5268.179999999999s)]
*  minutes. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5271.179999999999s)]
*  Seconds later, the Princeton reacquired the target, 60 miles away. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5272.179999999999s)]
*  Another crew managed to briefly lock onto it with a targeting camera before it zipped [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5277.74s)]
*  off again. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5282.7s)]
*  You know, I think that over beers we've sort of said, hey, man, if I saw this solo, I don't [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5283.7s)]
*  know that I would have come back and said anything, because it sounds so crazy when [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5289.62s)]
*  I say it. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5292.98s)]
*  Do you understand that reaction? [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5293.98s)]
*  I do. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5296.099999999999s)]
*  I've had some people tell me, you know, when you say that, you can sound crazy. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5297.099999999999s)]
*  I'll be, I'm not a UFO guy. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5300.099999999999s)]
*  But from what I hear you guys saying, there's something. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5303.5s)]
*  Yes. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5307.700000000001s)]
*  There's definitely something that, I don't know who's building it, who's got the technology, [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5308.700000000001s)]
*  who's got the brains, but there's something out there that was better than our airplane. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5313.580000000001s)]
*  The aircrew filed reports. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5319.660000000001s)]
*  Then, like the mysterious flying object, the Nimitz encounter disappeared. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5321.780000000001s)]
*  Nothing was said or done officially for five years until Lou Elizondo came across the story [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5327.58s)]
*  and investigated. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5334.5s)]
*  We spend millions of dollars in training these pilots, and they are seeing something that [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5336.32s)]
*  they can't explain. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5340.86s)]
*  Furthermore, that information's being backed up on electro-optical data, like gun camera [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5342.5s)]
*  footage, and by radar data. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5346.66s)]
*  Now, to me, that's compelling. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5348.34s)]
*  Inside the Pentagon, his findings were met with skepticism. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5350.9s)]
*  ACHIP's funding was eliminated in 2012, but Elizondo says he and a handful of others kept [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5354.78s)]
*  the mission alive until finally, frustrated, he quit the Pentagon in 2017. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5361.06s)]
*  But not before getting these three videos declassified. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5367.5s)]
*  And then things took a stranger turn. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5372.02s)]
*  I tried to help my colleague, Lou Elizondo, elevate the issue in the department and actually [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5374.9800000000005s)]
*  get it to the Secretary of Defense. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5378.86s)]
*  Christopher Mellon served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence for [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5380.7s)]
*  Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush and had access to top-secret government programs. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5385.3s)]
*  So it's not us. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5391.62s)]
*  That's one thing we know. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5392.7s)]
*  We know that. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5393.98s)]
*  I could say that with a very high degree of confidence, in part because of the positions [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5394.98s)]
*  I held in that department and I know the process. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5398.66s)]
*  Mellon says he grew concerned nothing was being done about UAPs, so he decided to do [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5401.86s)]
*  something. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5408.38s)]
*  In 2017, as a private citizen, he surreptitiously acquired the three Navy videos Elizondo had [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5409.38s)]
*  declassified and leaked them to the New York Times. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5415.9800000000005s)]
*  It's bizarre and unfortunate that someone like myself has to do something like that [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5420.22s)]
*  to get a national security issue like this on the agenda. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5426.14s)]
*  He joined forces with now civilian Lou Elizondo and they started to tell their story to anybody [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5429.26s)]
*  to newspapers, the History Channel, to members of Congress. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5436.34s)]
*  We knew and understood that you had to go to the public, get the public interested, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5440.74s)]
*  to get Congress interested, to then circle back to the Defense Department and get them [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5444.02s)]
*  to start taking a look at it. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5448.74s)]
*  And now it is. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5450.9800000000005s)]
*  Last year, the Pentagon resurrected AATIP. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5453.14s)]
*  It's now called the UAP Task Force. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5455.860000000001s)]
*  Congress members now are encouraged to report strange encounters and the Senate wants answers. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5459.02s)]
*  Anything that enters an airspace that's not supposed to be there is a threat. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5465.820000000001s)]
*  After receiving classified briefings on UAPs, Senator Marco Rubio called for a detailed [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5469.780000000001s)]
*  analysis. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5475.620000000001s)]
*  This past December, while he was still head of the Intelligence Committee, he asked the [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5477.240000000001s)]
*  Director of National Intelligence and the Pentagon to present Congress an unclassified [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5481.68s)]
*  report by next month. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5487.34s)]
*  This is a bizarre issue. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5489.54s)]
*  The Pentagon and other branches of the military have a long history of sort of dismissing [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5491.06s)]
*  this. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5495.900000000001s)]
*  What makes you think that this time is going to be different? [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5497.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're going to find out when we get that report. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5499.42s)]
*  You know, there's a stigma on Capitol Hill. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5501.740000000001s)]
*  I mean, some of my colleagues are very interested in this topic and some kind of, you know, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5503.780000000001s)]
*  giggle when you bring it up. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5508.02s)]
*  But I don't think we can allow the stigma to keep us from having an answer to a very [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5510.12s)]
*  fundamental question. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5514.04s)]
*  What do you want us to do about this? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5515.38s)]
*  I want us to take it seriously and have a process to take it seriously. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5517.14s)]
*  I want us to have a process to analyze the data every time it comes in, that there be [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5520.34s)]
*  a place where this is catalogued and constantly analyzed until we get some answers. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5524.34s)]
*  Maybe it has a very simple answer. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5529.26s)]
*  Maybe it doesn't. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5532.9400000000005s)]
*  A few weeks after our story aired, the Director of National Intelligence released an unclassified [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5535.580000000001s)]
*  report saying UAP probably lack a single explanation, but that some, quote, appear to demonstrate [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5541.860000000001s)]
*  advanced technology, meriting further analysis. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5548.46s)]
*  Without most of us noticing, our everyday activities, everything from getting cash at [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5561.780000000001s)]
*  an ATM to watching this program, depend on satellites in space. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5566.14s)]
*  And for the U.S. military, it's not just everyday activities. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5571.9400000000005s)]
*  The way it fights depends on space. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5575.62s)]
*  Satellites are used to communicate with troops, gather intelligence, fly drones, and target [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5578.700000000001s)]
*  weapons. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5582.700000000001s)]
*  But top military and intelligence leaders are now worried those satellites are vulnerable [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5583.9800000000005s)]
*  to attack. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5587.9400000000005s)]
*  They say China in particular has been actively testing anti-satellite weapons that could, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5589.62s)]
*  in effect, knock out America's eyes and ears. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5594.46s)]
*  No one wants a war in space. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5598.1s)]
*  But it's the job of a branch of the Air Force called Space Command to prepare for one. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5600.26s)]
*  If you've never heard of Space Command, it's because most of what it does happens hundreds, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5605.38s)]
*  even thousands of miles above the Earth or deep inside highly secure command centers. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5609.7s)]
*  You may be as surprised as we were to find out how the high stakes game for control of [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5615.78s)]
*  space is played. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5620.54s)]
*  The research being done at the Starfire Optical Range in Albuquerque, New Mexico was kept [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5624.16s)]
*  secret for many years. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5628.8s)]
*  And for a good reason, which only becomes apparent at night. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5631.639999999999s)]
*  First, the roof of one building is open to the stars. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5636.639999999999s)]
*  Then the walls retract and an object straight out of Star Wars appears, shooting a laser [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5641.92s)]
*  into the sky. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5649.139999999999s)]
*  The laser's beam helps a high powered telescope focus in on objects in space, so the Air Force [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5650.72s)]
*  can get a better look at the satellites of potential adversaries like China whizzing [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5656.38s)]
*  by at 17,000 miles per hour. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5660.68s)]
*  It's part of a complex and mostly secret battle for what the military considers the ultimate [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5664.1s)]
*  high ground. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5669.360000000001s)]
*  There is no such thing as a day without space. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5670.56s)]
*  That's the mantra of General John Hyten, the head of Air Force Space Command. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5673.3s)]
*  Think of what life used to be like and all the things that we have today in warfare that [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5677.76s)]
*  wouldn't exist without space. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5682.92s)]
*  Remotely piloted aircraft, all weather precision guided munitions didn't exist before space. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5685.04s)]
*  Now we can attack any target on the planet, anytime, anywhere, in any weather. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5691.9400000000005s)]
*  What would the US military do without space? [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5696.06s)]
*  What happens is you go back to World War II, you go back to industrial age warfare. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5699.4800000000005s)]
*  Your job is to make sure there is no day without space. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5703.280000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5706.56s)]
*  And you should be thinking right from the beginning that this is a contested environment. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5707.64s)]
*  Hyten drills into his troops that US satellites are no longer safe from attack. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5711.240000000001s)]
*  11 countries, including Iran and North Korea, now have the ability to launch objects into [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5716.120000000001s)]
*  orbit and Russia and China have been testing new anti-satellite technologies. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5721.56s)]
*  That's a competition that I wish wasn't occurring, but it is. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5727.120000000001s)]
*  And if we're threatened in space, we have the right of self-defense and we'll make [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5731.84s)]
*  sure we can execute that right. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5735.14s)]
*  And use force if necessary. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5736.96s)]
*  That's why we have a military. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5738.76s)]
*  I'm not NASA. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5742.64s)]
*  Space Command has 38,000 airmen at 134 locations around the world. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5744.9800000000005s)]
*  One of their most visible missions is to make sure US satellites can always get into space, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5751.32s)]
*  from launch pads like this one at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5756.56s)]
*  This is where space begins. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5761.62s)]
*  If you can't get the satellite into space, it's worthless. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5763.8s)]
*  I'm a satellite guy, so I get very nervous around rockets. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5767.0s)]
*  Because the most valuable thing on the rocket is the top, is the satellite. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5770.96s)]
*  Because when you have 500,000 pounds of thrust, if anything goes wrong, it's an explosion, [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5775.08s)]
*  it's dangerous, and you lose the capabilities that's on the top. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5780.88s)]
*  US has more satellites in space than any other nation. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5785.24s)]
*  Over 500 and counting. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5790.76s)]
*  More than 30 military and civilian launches will take place this year at Space Command [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5793.32s)]
*  bases in Florida and California. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5798.12s)]
*  The Pentagon told us it spends $10 billion a year on space. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5800.799999999999s)]
*  But we found a White House report that estimates the real cost is much higher, $25 billion [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5806.84s)]
*  when you count spy satellites and other classified spending. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5812.759999999999s)]
*  That's more than NASA or any other space agency in the world. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5816.28s)]
*  Some of those satellites provide the GPS signals that guide smart bombs now attacking [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5820.26s)]
*  ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5824.900000000001s)]
*  But a lot of people don't realize those same GPS satellites provide the signals your smartphone [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5828.18s)]
*  uses to navigate. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5833.34s)]
*  It's a service the Air Force provides free, not just here in the United States, but to [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5835.0s)]
*  the entire world. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5839.62s)]
*  This is a global utility, and there's a lot of people depending on this, and we understand [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5841.4800000000005s)]
*  that. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5846.06s)]
*  At a plant in Los Angeles, Colonel Bill Cooley showed us a GPS satellite that was being tested [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5847.54s)]
*  in a special chamber to make sure it was ready for launch. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5852.26s)]
*  When these things get on orbit, there's no depot. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5855.820000000001s)]
*  You can't drive it back into the maintenance shop. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5858.68s)]
*  It's somewhat like trying to design an automobile that is going to run for 12 to 15 years, and [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5860.96s)]
*  you can't take it in the shop, you can't take it in for refueling, but it's got to run 24-7. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5869.14s)]
*  In orbit, the satellite will spread out its solar panels, point its odd-looking antennas [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5875.18s)]
*  toward the Earth, and broadcast its location along with a time signal accurate to nanoseconds. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5879.4400000000005s)]
*  A GPS receiver needs signals from four of these satellites to figure out its location. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5885.54s)]
*  Colonel Cooley told us it costs a quarter of a billion dollars to design and build each one. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5891.5s)]
*  And to put it into space, how much does it cost? [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5896.9800000000005s)]
*  That's about the same. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5898.900000000001s)]
*  So you're pushing half a billion dollars to get that thing into space. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5899.900000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5903.06s)]
*  The U.S. has 31 active GPS satellites in space right now, and a lot more than smart bombs [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5904.06s)]
*  and smartphones depend on them. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5909.700000000001s)]
*  Bank ATM, cell phone towers, and power grids use their signals. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5912.22s)]
*  Farmers use GPS to work their fields. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5917.02s)]
*  So at your active time, you're just going to go active. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5919.22s)]
*  The GPS satellite system the whole world relies on is operated out of this room at Shriver [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5922.02s)]

*  We're going to repass SVM-34. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5932.22s)]
*  We were a little surprised by how many people it takes. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5934.26s)]
*  Eight personnel. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5937.62s)]
*  Eight people? [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5938.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5939.9400000000005s)]
*  For the entire world? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5940.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5941.9400000000005s)]
*  Are these technological experts? [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5942.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5944.740000000001s)]
*  But they're as young as 19 years old. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5945.740000000001s)]
*  Isn't there a minimum age for driving satellites? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5948.860000000001s)]
*  Not here. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5951.860000000001s)]
*  Another thing that surprised us is there's no way to effectively armor an important satellite [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5953.46s)]
*  like this or to conceal its location from attack. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5957.740000000001s)]
*  So it can't hide in space. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5961.32s)]
*  That's true. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5963.36s)]
*  In fact, it tells you where it is. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5964.36s)]
*  This is a system the whole world depends on. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5967.36s)]
*  It costs a small fortune to put it up there. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5970.08s)]
*  And it's a sitting duck. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5973.08s)]
*  Well, this is one of the challenges that in space command that we are very aware of. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5975.16s)]
*  Today, can a U.S. military satellite maneuver itself out of the way of an upcoming anti-satellite [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5981.639999999999s)]
*  weapon? [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5989.679999999999s)]
*  It depends on a huge number of variables. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5991.0s)]
*  So the answer is maybe. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5993.320000000001s)]
*  The answer is maybe. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5995.280000000001s)]
*  So you've got these satellites worth hundreds of millions of dollars. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=5996.280000000001s)]
*  And they maybe could get out of harm's way? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6001.56s)]
*  Depends on the satellite. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6005.64s)]
*  It depends on the mission. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6006.64s)]
*  It depends on when it was built. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6007.64s)]
*  It depends on how old it is. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6008.64s)]
*  It depends on when we know the threat is coming. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6010.12s)]
*  Knowing a threat is coming is no small task when the territory you're responsible for [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6015.76s)]

*  You can see the magnetic lines. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6030.76s)]
*  They're looping all over. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6032.32s)]

*  Air Force Base. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6039.72s)]

*  alert a chain of command leading to the White House. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6051.96s)]
*  Is an attack on an American satellite an act of war? [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6054.96s)]
*  That's been a line of debate for as long as I've been in this business. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6058.4s)]
*  If there is an attempt to attack or interfere with a U.S. satellite, who makes the decision [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6062.18s)]
*  about what we do about it? [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6069.92s)]
*  That would be the President of the United States. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6071.4s)]
*  And it's not just an anti-satellite weapon they're worried about. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6074.36s)]
*  There are other dangers, too. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6077.5199999999995s)]
*  Today we track about 23,000 objects. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6079.2s)]
*  How many of them are actually functioning satellites? [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6081.84s)]
*  Roughly 1,300 of those are active satellites. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6084.76s)]
*  The rest are debris. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6087.36s)]
*  Junk? [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6088.36s)]
*  Yes, sir, junk. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6089.36s)]
*  The movie Gravity dramatized the devastating effect man-made debris traveling at 17,000 [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6090.36s)]
*  could have on the International Space Station. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6102.92s)]
*  The JSPOC tracks dead satellites, old rocket boosters, even stray space gloves, and alerts [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6105.8s)]
*  satellite operators and astronauts if a collision is likely. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6111.36s)]
*  Last year in 2014, the International Space Station was maneuvered three times to avoid [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6115.32s)]
*  colliding with a piece of debris. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6121.32s)]
*  A lot of the debris that's threatening the space station was created in 2007 when the [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6123.8s)]
*  Chinese tested a ground-based anti-satellite weapon. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6128.64s)]
*  It crashed into one of their old weather satellites 530 miles above the Earth, shattering it into [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6132.240000000001s)]
*  pieces. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6138.52s)]
*  This is the debris that resulted from the 2007 Chinese ASAT. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6139.76s)]
*  So this is about 3,000 pieces of debris just from that one event. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6144.08s)]
*  That came just from that one collision? [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6147.88s)]
*  Just from that one collision. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6150.3s)]
*  How important was that test in terms of revealing Chinese space capabilities? [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6153.24s)]
*  It was a significant wake-up call to our entire military. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6159.24s)]
*  Until that singular event, I don't think the broader military realized that that is something [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6162.84s)]
*  we're going to have to worry about. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6166.92s)]
*  Have they conducted any similar tests since? [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6168.4s)]
*  They continued to conduct tests. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6170.639999999999s)]
*  The testing they're doing is to make sure that if they ever got into a conflict with [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6172.28s)]
*  us or any other spacefaring nation, they would have the ability to destroy satellites, and [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6176.8s)]
*  that is a bad thing for the United States, a bad thing for the planet. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6181.4s)]
*  A bad thing, no doubt. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6186.759999999999s)]
*  But is the U.S. doing it too? [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6188.639999999999s)]
*  And did China recently raise the stakes, test-firing a weapon deeper into space than ever before [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6191.0s)]
*  and threatening some of this country's most valuable satellites? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6196.5199999999995s)]
*  That part of our story when we come back. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6200.5199999999995s)]
*  Tonight, we've been giving you a rare look at how a branch of the U.S. Air Force called [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6211.4s)]
*  Space Command is preparing for a battle most of us have never thought about, one high above [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6217.839999999999s)]
*  the Earth defending the satellites upon which our daily life and national security have [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6223.08s)]
*  come to depend. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6227.5199999999995s)]
*  Few of those satellites are more important to the U.S. military than the ones that provide [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6229.5199999999995s)]
*  early warning of a long-range nuclear missile attack. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6233.719999999999s)]
*  Even at the height of the Cold War, those satellites stationed deep in space, some 20,000 [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6237.48s)]
*  miles above the Earth, were considered safe from attack. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6242.719999999999s)]
*  But deep space is no longer the sanctuary it once was. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6246.639999999999s)]
*  A former Space Command officer told us that two years ago, the Chinese tested an anti-satellite [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6250.24s)]
*  weapon that went higher than any previously reported and came too close for comfort to [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6255.719999999999s)]
*  the area where those missile warning satellites are located. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6261.0s)]
*  If those satellites are now at risk, that is something that, from the U.S. military's [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6265.68s)]
*  point of view, is new because it's always believed those satellites, there wasn't really [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6270.6s)]
*  a significant threat to those capabilities. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6276.64s)]
*  Brian Whedon served as an officer in Air Force Space Command until 2007. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6279.92s)]
*  He's now technical advisor to the Secure World Foundation, which promotes the peaceful use [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6284.8s)]
*  of space. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6289.76s)]
*  The topic for today's discussion… [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6291.0s)]
*  Whedon says the Chinese have test-fired as many as six ground-based anti-satellite weapons. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6292.84s)]
*  Only one in 2007 actually hit a satellite and created debris, but one of the others [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6298.92s)]
*  soared to new heights. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6304.32s)]
*  There was one test in May of 2013 that may have gone as high as 30,000 kilometers. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6306.04s)]
*  And that's one that I think really is kind of causing quite a bit of concern on the U.S. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6315.2s)]
*  side. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6321.28s)]
*  To understand just how far that is, the International Space Station orbits at about 200 miles above [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6322.28s)]
*  the Earth. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6328.0s)]
*  And those GPS satellites we showed you orbit at 12,000 miles. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6329.08s)]
*  The 2013 test launch Whedon is talking about is believed to have gone up to 18,600 miles, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6333.719999999999s)]
*  just shy of what's known as geosynchronous or geostationary orbit. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6341.24s)]
*  And that's where the U.S. military has stationed some of its most valuable missile warning [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6346.2s)]
*  sensors and top-secret communications devices that serve as its eyes and ears in time of [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6350.08s)]
*  war. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6356.24s)]
*  I think what keeps a lot of American military planners up at night is if China has anti-satellite [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6357.24s)]
*  capabilities, when do they use those in a conflict? [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6363.96s)]
*  Do they use them at the start to try and blind the U.S.? [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6366.6s)]
*  Those sound like the crown jewels of American satellites up there in geosynchronous orbit. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6369.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6376.12s)]
*  Satellites were developed in an environment where the U.S. assumed there would not be [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6377.16s)]
*  reason to attack them. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6382.38s)]
*  So you end up with a small number of very expensive satellites that have a lot of capability [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6383.88s)]
*  packed onto each one. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6389.84s)]
*  And result is juicy targets. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6392.44s)]
*  A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry admitted testing an anti-satellite weapon in 2007. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6396.04s)]
*  But China has denied conducting subsequent tests and told us it is committed to the peaceful [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6401.5199999999995s)]
*  use of outer space. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6406.84s)]
*  It said the 2013 launch into deep space was simply a science experiment. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6408.84s)]
*  But using skills he honed as an officer in space command, Brian Whedon analyzed commercial [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6414.9800000000005s)]
*  satellite photos and other publicly available data about the launch. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6419.92s)]
*  He concluded that the science experiment was probably fired into space by a military missile [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6424.6s)]
*  launcher like this. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6429.8s)]
*  General John Hyten, the head of Air Force Space Command, has seen the classified intelligence [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6432.64s)]
*  about that launch. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6437.160000000001s)]
*  These follow on Chinese tests. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6438.6s)]
*  How high up do they go? [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6440.84s)]
*  Pretty high. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6443.0s)]
*  Well, how high is that? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6444.0s)]
*  I won't characterize what the Chinese capabilities are. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6446.360000000001s)]
*  I just will tell you that we know what they are. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6449.68s)]
*  Well, I've read reports by the Congressional Commission which said that in the next five [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6452.08s)]
*  to 10 years, China likely will be able to hold at risk U.S. national security satellites [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6458.36s)]
*  in every orbital regime. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6465.36s)]
*  Do you agree with this statement by the Commission? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6468.16s)]
*  I think they'll be able to threaten every orbital regime that we operate in. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6470.339999999999s)]
*  Now we have to figure out how to defend those satellites. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6474.96s)]
*  And we're going to. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6478.5599999999995s)]
*  Space command is making its new satellites more maneuverable to evade attack and also [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6480.86s)]
*  more resistant to jamming. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6485.9s)]
*  It's building a new radar system that will enable the Space Operations Center to track [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6487.94s)]
*  objects in space as small as a softball. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6491.82s)]
*  And it's deployed two highly maneuverable surveillance satellites to keep watch on what [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6495.1s)]
*  other countries are doing high up in geostationary orbit. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6499.66s)]
*  Satellites watching other satellites. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6504.1s)]
*  Satellites watching other satellites. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6505.84s)]
*  And how do they improve your knowledge? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6507.62s)]
*  Because they're up close. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6510.9s)]
*  Normally the capabilities of spy satellites are kept top secret. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6512.98s)]
*  But Space Command put out this fact sheet about its new assets in geosynchronous orbit. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6516.98s)]
*  We want people to understand that we're watching. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6522.42s)]
*  There will be no surprises in geo. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6524.94s)]
*  And we want everybody in the world to know that there will be no surprises in that orbit. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6526.5s)]
*  It's way too valuable for us to just be surprised. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6530.46s)]
*  Deterrence in the nuclear world was built on weapons. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6534.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6538.26s)]
*  Deterrence in the space world has got to be built on a little bit different construct. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6539.38s)]
*  It's the ability to convince an adversary that if they attack us they will fail. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6544.860000000001s)]
*  Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James told us the Pentagon plans to spend an extra $5 [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6550.860000000001s)]
*  billion over the next five years to protect its satellites. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6555.34s)]
*  What do you consider to be the greatest single threat to U.S. satellites? [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6559.74s)]
*  An anti-satellite weapon would certainly be a great threat. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6565.18s)]
*  A laser would be a threat. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6569.18s)]
*  Jamming capabilities are also a threat. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6571.9400000000005s)]
*  Do China and Russia have lasers that could blind American satellites? [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6574.700000000001s)]
*  They are testing and investing. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6580.54s)]
*  And that is worrisome to the United States. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6582.9400000000005s)]
*  All right. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6586.62s)]
*  Good morning, Bravo crew. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6587.62s)]
*  We're going to start it off with intel. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6588.62s)]
*  Testing and investing in sometimes mysterious ways. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6590.62s)]
*  Last year, airmen at the Joint Space Operations Center monitored the seemingly routine launch [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6594.86s)]
*  of three Russian communications satellites. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6600.74s)]
*  Lieutenant General Jay Raymond and his team spotted what they assumed was just an ordinary [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6604.299999999999s)]
*  piece of debris from the launch. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6608.5199999999995s)]
*  About a week later, a young Air Force captain detected that that debris started to move. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6610.74s)]
*  Move as in maneuver, right up close to the body of the rocket that had launched it into [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6616.62s)]
*  space. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6621.46s)]
*  What is that object that keeps maneuvering in space? [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6622.46s)]
*  David, I'm not going to speculate, but I can tell you what it isn't. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6626.42s)]
*  It's not a piece of debris. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6629.74s)]
*  That type of maneuver is what's called a rendezvous and proximity operation. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6631.38s)]
*  And it's actually something that the U.S. has been working on for the last several years, [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6635.66s)]
*  if not longer. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6639.14s)]
*  Satellites that can rendezvous with other satellites may someday be used to refuel or [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6641.3s)]
*  make repairs. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6645.42s)]
*  But they're potential weapons as well. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6646.42s)]
*  If you can get close enough to inspect or service another satellite, is that close enough [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6649.219999999999s)]
*  to disable it? [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6655.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6656.98s)]
*  And there's a wide range of ways you could do that. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6657.98s)]
*  Such as? [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6660.9s)]
*  Breaking off a solar panel. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6661.9s)]
*  Or even some have theorized, you know, spray painting over optics so that the satellite [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6664.42s)]
*  can't see anything. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6669.139999999999s)]
*  So if you thought space was a peaceful haven, think again. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6672.0199999999995s)]
*  This is a new kind of space race, a cosmic game of hide and seek. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6675.7s)]
*  And the same technology that enables this telescope to see more clearly into space could [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6680.26s)]
*  potentially be used to help a laser weapon focus more powerfully on a target. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6685.86s)]
*  The Bush administration wanted to develop such a weapon here in 2006, but ran into resistance [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6691.22s)]
*  from Congress. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6696.5s)]
*  Is any work being done on lasers that could be used to blind satellites? [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6697.5s)]
*  There's no such work at this time. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6704.02s)]
*  Does the U.S. have any weapons in space? [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6705.900000000001s)]
*  No, we do not. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6709.3s)]
*  I'm thinking of satellites that maneuver next to another satellite and then take some [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6711.3s)]
*  action to disable it without blowing it up. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6717.22s)]
*  We do have satellites that maneuver, that look at things in space, but not what you [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6720.620000000001s)]
*  just described. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6727.42s)]
*  Do you think the Chinese believe that? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6728.42s)]
*  I don't know what they believe. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6731.86s)]
*  When the Chinese look at America's space operations, they see a program that by most estimates [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6735.219999999999s)]
*  spends 10 times more than they do and has tested anti-satellite weapons of its own. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6739.74s)]
*  Space Command told us an American F-15 fired a missile into space five times in the 1980s, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6745.86s)]
*  and one of those times destroyed a U.S. satellite, creating debris that remained in space for [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6752.66s)]
*  decades. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6757.78s)]
*  One of the officers involved in that test was General Hyten. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6759.18s)]
*  I think it was a surprise to most people on that program how much debris we created. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6762.22s)]
*  So where do we get off lecturing the Chinese about testing anti-satellite weapons if we [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6767.780000000001s)]
*  were the first and if we created debris? [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6772.860000000001s)]
*  Well, because we learned our lesson and told the world and the Congress said you will not [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6775.900000000001s)]
*  test that weapon anymore. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6781.780000000001s)]
*  So when a U.S. intelligence satellite containing hazardous fuel malfunctioned in 2008, the [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6783.78s)]
*  Navy's Aegis defense system designed to knock out incoming missiles was used to shoot it [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6791.94s)]
*  down. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6796.74s)]
*  The Chinese must think we've got an anti-satellite capability as well. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6797.74s)]
*  I think they certainly have come to that conclusion, or not if the U.S. doesn't have a capability, [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6801.7s)]
*  they certainly could field one very quickly. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6806.179999999999s)]
*  What you just described is the formula for an arms race. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6809.679999999999s)]
*  They see a capability, we have a capability, they react to that capability, they react, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6813.22s)]
*  we react and there you go. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6819.4400000000005s)]
*  I think it certainly could turn out that way. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6821.14s)]
*  One of the big dangers is that a problem in space could inflame a conflict here on Earth. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6823.54s)]
*  For instance, if a nation suddenly lost its early warning satellites in the middle of [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6828.9400000000005s)]
*  a crisis, it might assume it was the beginning of an attack. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6833.38s)]
*  Now in reality it might have been a simple manufacturing failure, it might have been [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6837.54s)]
*  a piece of space debris, but in the moment of crisis I think that's the sort of situation [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6842.74s)]
*  that could escalate something that might otherwise have stayed partly contained. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6848.26s)]
*  General Hyten told us Space Command is currently only developing weapons that do not create [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6856.3s)]
*  debris, like this mobile jammer which can be used to incapacitate satellites. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6860.74s)]
*  We have a capability called a counter communication system that is built to deny an adversary [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6865.9s)]
*  the use of space communications. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6870.9s)]
*  All I can say is it's a capability that exists on the ground and it does not create debris [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6873.0599999999995s)]
*  in any way. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6879.74s)]
*  The only two things you've told me about the US ability to fight in space are the ability [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6880.74s)]
*  to maneuver your satellites and to jam other satellites. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6887.58s)]
*  Is that it? [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6893.78s)]
*  That's not it, but that's all I can tell you. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6895.66s)]
*  One secret project is hiding in plain sight. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6900.38s)]
*  It's the X-37B space plane, a small remotely piloted vehicle that can fly in space for [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6903.34s)]
*  20 months at a time. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6909.54s)]
*  This is a model of the space. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6911.26s)]
*  A model of it hangs in Hyten's headquarters in Colorado. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6912.54s)]
*  So here's your chance to end all the speculation about what the space plane is really for. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6915.9800000000005s)]
*  It's really for cool things. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6921.1s)]
*  For instance. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6924.24s)]
*  For instance, it goes up to space, but unlike other satellites it actually comes back. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6925.24s)]
*  Anything that we put in the payload bay that we take up to space we can now bring back [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6929.78s)]
*  and we can learn from that. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6933.18s)]
*  Can you tell me whether or not someday the space plane is going to become a weapon system? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6934.94s)]
*  The intent is I cannot answer that question. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6941.38s)]
*  But if you're determined not to create any more debris in space, why can't you say that [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6945.86s)]
*  this might not become a weapon system? [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6950.86s)]
*  I'm not going to say what it's going to become because we're experimenting. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6953.5s)]
*  Hyten told us there are bound to be conflicts in space. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6958.3s)]
*  The important thing is to avoid a shooting war that could create so much debris it might [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6961.54s)]
*  become impossible to put satellites or astronauts into orbit. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6966.02s)]
*  The Chinese of course look at everything you're doing. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6970.3s)]
*  I'm sure they're looking at this. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6973.58s)]
*  And they say you're developing the capability to threaten them and that all those satellites [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6976.12s)]
*  are a direct threat to their national security. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6981.6s)]
*  So why wouldn't they create a capability to take out those satellites? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6986.1s)]
*  The Chinese are also building a very robust exploration program to go to the moon to explore [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6991.740000000001s)]
*  the stars. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6998.04s)]
*  They could destroy their entire program by going down the way they are. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=6999.14s)]
*  There's not a shooting war going on out there, but it sure does seem like there is a very [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7003.3s)]
*  high stakes contest going on in space. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7008.06s)]
*  It is high stakes. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7012.26s)]
*  High stakes with very few rules. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7014.58s)]
*  The 1967 UN Treaty calls for the peaceful use of space. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7017.34s)]
*  That sounds nice, but leaves a lot of room for countries to do what they want. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7023.0199999999995s)]
*  Right now is there any code of conduct for space operations? [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7027.72s)]
*  There is not an agreed upon code of conduct. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7030.5s)]
*  So it's every country for himself? [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7033.78s)]
*  Pretty much. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7037.66s)]
*  It's been a year since the tiny helicopter Ingenuity and the one-ton rover Perseverance [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7044.58s)]
*  left planet Earth, and they've come a very long way since then. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7054.76s)]
*  In February, they landed in a hazardous and previously unexplored part of Mars called [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7059.42s)]
*  the Jezero Crater, where Perseverance will be looking for signs of ancient life. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7063.82s)]
*  In April, Ingenuity disconnected from Perseverance's belly and made history, performing the first [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7069.3s)]
*  flights ever in the atmosphere of another planet. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7075.06s)]
*  It's hard to imagine, but worth remembering as you watch this story we first broadcast [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7078.06s)]
*  in May, that this all happened millions of miles away in outer space. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7083.02s)]
*  On April 6, in this desolate Martian crater 170 million miles from Earth, Perseverance [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7089.8s)]
*  posed for a selfie with Ingenuity, the little helicopter it had just dropped off. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7095.92s)]
*  Two weeks later, the rover's cameras recorded Ingenuity's historic first flight, hovering [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7101.92s)]
*  ten feet off the ground for 30 seconds. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7107.08s)]
*  It may not look like much, but for those who'd worked so long to make it happen, it was a [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7109.76s)]
*  reason to rejoice. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7115.0s)]
*  Project manager Mimi Ong led the team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California that's [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7117.56s)]
*  been working on Ingenuity for six years. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7122.52s)]
*  How hard is it to fly a helicopter on Mars? [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7126.200000000001s)]
*  Very, very, very hard. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7128.56s)]
*  We really truly started with the question of, is it possible? [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7131.84s)]
*  A lot of people thought it could not be done. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7135.52s)]
*  Because it's really counterintuitive. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7138.080000000001s)]
*  I mean, you need atmosphere for the place to push atmosphere to get lived. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7139.080000000001s)]
*  The atmosphere on Mars is completely different than the world. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7143.400000000001s)]
*  The atmosphere on Mars is so thin. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7145.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, the room we're in, right, it's compared to that, it's 1% of the atmospheric density [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7147.280000000001s)]
*  over there. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7151.72s)]
*  So the question of, really, can you generate enough lift, you know, to really build, to [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7152.72s)]
*  lift up anything, that was the fundamental question. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7157.5s)]
*  In subsequent flights, Ingenuity has gone higher and farther, traveling more than a [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7160.9s)]
*  mile in all over the surface of Mars. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7165.42s)]
*  It is a triumph not only for NASA, but for its partners in the private sector, who help [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7168.58s)]
*  make various parts of the helicopter. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7173.62s)]
*  Don't let it go. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7176.58s)]
*  Don't freak out. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7177.58s)]
*  Keenan has a history of making unusual things that can fly. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7178.58s)]
*  He's an engineer at a company called AeroVironment, which produces drones for military and civilian [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7182.0199999999995s)]
*  use. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7187.9s)]
*  I mean, that's incredible. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7188.9s)]
*  Ten years ago, for a military research project, Keenan and his team created this robotic hummingbird, [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7190.34s)]
*  which has a tiny camera on board. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7196.34s)]
*  Whoa! [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7199.34s)]
*  There it is. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7200.34s)]
*  Oh my God, that's amazing. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7201.34s)]
*  Keenan and engineer Ben Pippenberg led the AeroVironment team that created Ingenuity's [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7207.1s)]
*  rotors, motors, and landing gear. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7212.9800000000005s)]
*  Why was this so challenging? [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7215.7s)]
*  Because it has to be a spacecraft as well as an aircraft. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7218.42s)]
*  And flying it as an aircraft on Mars is pretty challenging because of the density of the [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7223.28s)]
*  air that's similar to about Earth at 100,000 feet. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7228.38s)]
*  How do you go about it? [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7230.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, so building everything extremely lightweight is really, really critical. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7232.98s)]
*  The helicopter's blades, for example, are made of a styrofoam-like material coated with [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7237.9s)]
*  carbon fiber. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7242.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7243.24s)]
*  They're stiff and strong. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7244.24s)]
*  Get a sense of how lightweight and stiff that is. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7246.68s)]
*  It's nothing. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7249.62s)]
*  Yeah, it weighs nothing. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7250.62s)]
*  But incredibly light. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7251.62s)]
*  Here we go, taking off. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7253.66s)]
*  This is the first time they've shown an outsider this version of Ingenuity, which they plan [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7255.38s)]
*  to use for education and research. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7259.94s)]
*  They call it Terry. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7262.28s)]
*  A lift off. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7263.5199999999995s)]
*  Here on Earth, Terry's blades are spinning at about 400 revolutions per minute. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7265.639999999999s)]
*  On Mars, in the thin atmosphere, they'd have to spin six times faster to generate the same [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7270.599999999999s)]
*  lift. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7275.96s)]
*  And then land. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7276.96s)]
*  Ingenuity costs $85 million to build and operate, Terry a lot less, but it's still nerve-racking [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7278.44s)]
*  to be handed its controls. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7285.0s)]
*  All right. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7286.719999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7287.719999999999s)]
*  You've got it. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7288.719999999999s)]
*  Slide it right. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7289.719999999999s)]
*  Slide all the way to the right if you want. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7290.72s)]
*  Slide left. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7293.280000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7294.280000000001s)]
*  I'll bring it up a little bit. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7295.280000000001s)]
*  Now stop. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7296.4400000000005s)]
*  The joysticks we use to fly Terry are of no use on Mars. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7297.52s)]
*  Radio signals take too long to get there. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7301.72s)]
*  All right. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7303.92s)]
*  Let me take over now. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7304.92s)]
*  I've switched you out. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7305.92s)]
*  And we'll go back to the... [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7306.92s)]
*  Even someone as good at flying drones and hummingbirds as Matt Keenan couldn't fly a [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7310.360000000001s)]
*  helicopter on Mars. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7314.68s)]
*  Engineers would happen in 2014 in a test chamber that replicated the atmosphere on [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7316.64s)]
*  Mars when Keenan tried to use a joystick to fly an early version of Ingenuity. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7321.04s)]
*  Surprise. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7326.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7327.4400000000005s)]
*  All right. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7328.4400000000005s)]
*  So much for that vehicle. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7329.4400000000005s)]
*  So this very quick demonstration is to show you a human being can't respond quickly enough [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7330.4400000000005s)]
*  to control it. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7335.320000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7336.320000000001s)]
*  So engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory equipped Ingenuity with a computerized system [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7337.320000000001s)]
*  that allows it to stabilize itself and navigate on its own. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7343.2s)]
*  In 2016, the new system aced the chamber test. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7346.4s)]
*  The blades are being commanded 400 or 500 times per second. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7350.76s)]
*  They proved it could fly, but Ingenuity still had to weigh under four pounds and fit in [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7355.28s)]
*  the belly of perseverance. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7360.2s)]
*  Five. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7361.76s)]
*  Five. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7362.76s)]
*  Four. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7363.76s)]
*  Engine ignition. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7364.76s)]
*  Two. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7365.76s)]
*  One. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7366.76s)]
*  And it had to be tough enough to survive the journey to Mars. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7367.76s)]
*  And liftoff. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7369.94s)]
*  On July 30th, 2020, Perseverance and Ingenuity took off from Cape Canaveral. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7371.9s)]
*  Nearly seven months later, as this simulation shows, the spacecraft's heat shield hit the [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7378.179999999999s)]
*  Martian atmosphere, going 12,000 miles per hour. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7382.66s)]
*  Perseverance ready to execute entry, descent and landing on her own. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7387.299999999999s)]
*  As he sat in the control room, Al Chen, the leader of the landing team, had absolutely [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7391.66s)]
*  no control. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7396.299999999999s)]
*  Radio signals would take about 11 minutes to travel from Earth to Mars. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7397.8s)]
*  The spacecraft was pre-programmed to descend, maneuver and pick a landing site on its own. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7402.24s)]
*  All the work his colleagues hoped to do on Mars would be impossible if his part of the [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7408.24s)]
*  mission failed. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7412.74s)]
*  How long have you been working on this mission? [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7414.26s)]
*  Coming up on nine years or so. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7416.42s)]
*  Really? [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7417.820000000001s)]
*  That's a lot of work for seven minutes of terror. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7418.820000000001s)]
*  Nine years of work, seven minutes of terror. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7421.42s)]
*  It's done if the parachute doesn't work. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7423.42s)]
*  That's right. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7424.74s)]
*  No one wants to be the guy that drops the baton. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7425.74s)]
*  No landing by a spacecraft has ever been recorded as well as this one. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7428.92s)]
*  There were six cameras capturing it all from different angles. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7433.4s)]
*  The parachute deployed, then the heat shield fell away like a lens cap, and Perseverance [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7436.92s)]
*  got its first look at the ground. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7442.2s)]
*  This is not a simulation. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7445.44s)]
*  This is what it looks like to parachute onto Mars. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7447.36s)]
*  How fast is it moving at this point? [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7452.26s)]
*  Yeah, we're still going about 350 miles an hour and still slowing down. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7453.660000000001s)]
*  So it looks gentle here, but in fact it's falling at more than 300 miles an hour. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7456.26s)]
*  That's right. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7461.54s)]
*  We're heading straight down at near race car speeds. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7462.54s)]
*  Below lay a series of safe landing spots, but the wind was blowing the spacecraft towards [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7465.1s)]
*  more treacherous territory to the east, and Perseverance sent a message to Earth saying [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7469.820000000001s)]
*  the thrusters it needed to slow down might not be working properly. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7474.72s)]
*  So you get a reading saying the jets that are going to help it slow down and control [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7479.36s)]
*  the landing, that they're not working. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7484.42s)]
*  So what do you do? [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7486.42s)]
*  There's nothing you can do, right? [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7487.42s)]
*  Everything's already happened. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7488.82s)]
*  That's the mind-bending part of this, right? [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7489.82s)]
*  You are sweating now. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7491.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7492.679999999999s)]
*  I'm right back there again. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7493.679999999999s)]
*  So, yeah. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7494.679999999999s)]
*  To Al Chen's relief, Perseverance's computerized landing system did what it was designed to [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7495.679999999999s)]
*  do. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7503.82s)]
*  It found a suitable landing spot even in rocky terrain. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7504.82s)]
*  And despite the warning, the thrusters worked. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7508.4400000000005s)]
*  You can see them kicking up dust as they fire to slow the spacecraft down. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7511.5s)]
*  Sky crane maneuver has started. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7515.240000000001s)]
*  The descent stage, known as the sky crane, lowered Perseverance to the ground. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7517.160000000001s)]
*  It hovered for a moment, then flew off to crash a safe distance away. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7522.040000000001s)]
*  And there goes the descent stage. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7526.200000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7527.200000000001s)]
*  Touchdown confirmed. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7528.200000000001s)]
*  Perseverance safely on its surface of Mars. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7529.200000000001s)]
*  So at that point, big sigh of relief. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7532.200000000001s)]
*  I almost collapsed over this console. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7535.56s)]
*  Over two months after the landing on the Red Planet, a team of engineers, programmers [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7537.6s)]
*  and scientists here on Earth were living on Mars time. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7542.14s)]
*  It's their job to monitor the rover's health and tell it where to go and how to search [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7545.740000000001s)]
*  for signs of life. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7550.5s)]
*  While Perseverance slept to conserve energy during the freezing Martian nights, the team [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7551.9800000000005s)]
*  on Earth analyzed the photographs and instrument readings it had sent back. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7556.660000000001s)]
*  They then prepared a list of things for it to do the following morning when it woke up. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7561.740000000001s)]
*  And so it's just after midnight on Mars. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7566.2s)]
*  The vehicle's asleep. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7568.24s)]
*  Project manager Matt Wallace explained that a day on Mars is 40 minutes longer than on [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7569.92s)]
*  Earth. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7574.54s)]
*  The team's schedule was constantly changing. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7575.54s)]
*  So people here are Mars night shift workers. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7578.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good way to think of it. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7582.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7584.32s)]
*  But I mean, working night shift is tough enough, but this is a night shift that's constantly [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7585.32s)]
*  shifting. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7588.4s)]
*  Constantly moving. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7589.4s)]
*  That's right. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7590.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7591.4s)]
*  On Perseverance's fourth day on Mars, it swiveled the powerful camera on its mast and took a [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7592.48s)]
*  look around. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7597.839999999999s)]
*  A space enthusiast named Sean Doran put the images together, set them to music and posted [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7599.799999999999s)]
*  the movie on YouTube. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7605.879999999999s)]
*  Even one of the top scientists on the project was moved when he saw it. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7608.839999999999s)]
*  I went and got a beer and watched this thing scroll by. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7612.799999999999s)]
*  And that was the moment when I felt like I was there. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7616.32s)]
*  Sean Farley leads the science team that will direct Perseverance through the Jezero crater. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7620.64s)]
*  It's an area that scientists have long wanted to search for signs of ancient life that may [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7625.08s)]
*  be hidden in the rocks. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7630.400000000001s)]
*  The oldest evidence of life on Earth is about three and a half billion years old. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7632.4400000000005s)]
*  Those rocks were deposited in a shallow sea. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7637.160000000001s)]
*  This crater that you see here was a lake three and a half billion years ago. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7640.780000000001s)]
*  So we are looking at the same environment and the same time period on two different [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7645.4400000000005s)]
*  planets. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7649.400000000001s)]
*  If it's determined, however long in the future, that no, there was not ever life, what does that mean? [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7650.48s)]
*  The place where Perseverance landed here in Jezero crater is the most habitable time period [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7657.5599999999995s)]
*  on Mars and the most habitable environment that we know about. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7663.799999999999s)]
*  This is as good as it gets, at least with our current understanding of what Mars has [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7667.799999999999s)]
*  to offer. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7671.32s)]
*  And if we don't find life here, it does make us worry that perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7672.32s)]
*  Perseverance hasn't strayed far from its landing site yet, but its telescopic camera has already [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7679.28s)]
*  spotted a large number of boulders that Ken Farley says he didn't expect to see in the [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7684.12s)]
*  middle of an ancient lake. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7688.96s)]
*  So this has surprised you. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7691.04s)]
*  Absolutely, yeah. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7693.2s)]
*  So what did those boulders tell you? [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7694.2s)]
*  The most reasonable interpretation is a flood. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7695.92s)]
*  You don't have fast flowing water out in the middle of the lake. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7698.84s)]
*  You get fast flowing water in a river. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7701.62s)]
*  And so what that's telling us is there was a river that was capable of transporting boulders [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7704.52s)]
*  that were this big. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7710.160000000001s)]
*  So what, the lake would have gone down perhaps and then later on there was a flood? [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7711.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7715.64s)]
*  Perseverance was supposed to leave Ingenuity behind after a 30-day demonstration of its [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7717.6s)]
*  flying ability. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7721.8s)]
*  But NASA officials decided to keep the duo together longer to explore how rovers and [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7722.8s)]
*  helicopters might work together in the future. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7728.6s)]
*  The fastest that Perseverance was designed to travel is a tenth of a mile per hour. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7733.32s)]
*  Ingenuity has already gone 80 times faster, according to project manager Mimi Ong. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7738.2s)]
*  Adding an aerial vehicle, a flying vehicle for space exploration will be game-changing. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7743.679999999999s)]
*  It frees you in a way. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7749.24s)]
*  Absolutely, yes. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7750.839999999999s)]
*  So a flying vehicle, a rotorcraft, would allow us to get to places we simply can't access [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7751.919999999999s)]
*  today like sites of steep cliffs, inside deep crevices. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7755.919999999999s)]
*  After Perseverance explores the floor of Jezero Crater, it'll head towards what's [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7760.2s)]
*  believed to be the remnant of an ancient river delta, where billions of years ago conditions [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7764.48s)]
*  should have been right for microorganisms to exist. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7769.639999999999s)]
*  As this simulation shows, the rover's robotic arm can collect about 40 core samples of rock [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7773.32s)]
*  that'll be sealed in special tubes and left on the planet's surface. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7779.28s)]
*  NASA plans to send another mission to Mars to retrieve the tubes and bring them back [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7783.599999999999s)]
*  to Earth. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7788.04s)]
*  In about 10 years, Ken Farley says, scientists examining those samples may be confronted [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7789.2s)]
*  with a new and perplexing question. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7794.8s)]
*  How do you look for life that may not be life as you know it? [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7797.68s)]
*  We've never had to do that before. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7802.96s)]
*  We've never had to actually ask the question. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7804.28s)]
*  Is there a form of life that we can't even conceive of? [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7807.44s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to have to conceive of it, I think. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7810.08s)]
*  That's the whole point of this. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7813.0s)]
*  We're going to have to start conceiving of life as we don't know it. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7814.0s)]
*  If all goes according to plan, Perseverance will be making tracks on Mars for years to [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7816.64s)]
*  come. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7821.160000000001s)]
*  Since it's carrying the first working audio microphones on the Red Planet, we'll leave [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7822.160000000001s)]
*  you with what it sounds like as the one-ton rover slowly moves across the vast, lonely [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7826.64s)]
*  expanses of Mars. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7832.52s)]
*  Since our story first aired, China landed its first rover on Mars about a thousand [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7834.2s)]
*  miles away from where Perseverance is located. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7847.04s)]
*  China's National Space Administration has said it too plans to collect samples of the [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7850.5599999999995s)]
*  Red Planet and bring them back to Earth. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7854.599999999999s)]
*  Now, the latest from Mars, thanks to NASA's incredibly sophisticated geologist, a one-ton [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7865.2s)]
*  rover named Curiosity that landed on Mars more than four years ago. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7871.679999999999s)]
*  Its biggest discovery so far is this. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7876.96s)]
*  More than three billion years ago, Mars had all the building blocks necessary for life. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7880.36s)]
*  Back then, Mars and Earth were very similar, wet, warm, and habitable. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7886.48s)]
*  But as life evolved on Earth, Mars became cold, dry, and inhospitable. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7892.16s)]
*  Did life ever exist on Mars? [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7898.48s)]
*  We don't know yet. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7900.599999999999s)]
*  But the rover Curiosity is on the hunt and has been slowly maneuvering through a topographic [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7902.12s)]
*  treasure trove. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7907.92s)]
*  Tonight, you'll see stunning pictures and hear what Curiosity is telling us about Mars [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7909.36s)]
*  and Earth. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7915.88s)]
*  From Mars, Curiosity can barely see Earth more than 30 million miles away. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7918.24s)]
*  But Curiosity is seeing Mars as never before, leaving its mark, its tracks, and sending [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7923.92s)]
*  back postcards of sand dunes 20 feet tall, extending for miles, ancient stone lake beds [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7930.74s)]
*  that have been dry for billions of years, and time-lapse pictures of a Martian sunset. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7938.04s)]
*  Like any vain photographer, Curiosity poses for selfies along the way as she works to [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7945.12s)]
*  solve Mars' most challenging mysteries. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7951.22s)]
*  So we're reading the rocks with Curiosity. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7954.64s)]
*  Reading the rocks. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7957.24s)]
*  We read the rocks. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7958.24s)]
*  Katie Stack-Morgan, a geologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, helps decide what [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7959.5199999999995s)]
*  pictures Curiosity should take and where it should go. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7965.44s)]
*  Hundreds of scientists and engineers support the rover. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7970.28s)]
*  They can't drive it in real time from Earth because there's a 30-minute time lag to get [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7973.4s)]
*  a message to Mars and back. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7978.799999999999s)]
*  So Curiosity, shown in this NASA animation, gets its instructions beamed up at the start [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7981.16s)]
*  of each day. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7987.5599999999995s)]
*  And the rover is such a talented geologist that it can teach us a lot from a single pebble [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7988.98s)]
*  fused into a bigger rock. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7995.16s)]
*  There's a pebble right here, and it's actually quite round. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=7997.88s)]
*  And on Mars, round pebbles mean they used to be wet. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8001.98s)]
*  And if you think about pebbles that you find in a stream on Earth, they tend to be very [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8005.9s)]
*  round as well. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8010.0s)]
*  Because as they move in the streams, pebbles are hitting other pebbles, and they round [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8011.679999999999s)]
*  off all the little corners. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8015.28s)]
*  That's how we know this deposit was formed in rushing water. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8017.54s)]
*  I mean, this is the first evidence we have from the surface that water flowed across [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8021.099999999999s)]
*  the surface of Mars. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8026.08s)]
*  This NASA animation is based on Mars' actual surface. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8028.18s)]
*  Curiosity's capabilities include a laser that zaps rocks up to 23 feet away to find out [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8033.14s)]
*  what they're made of. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8039.34s)]
*  It's the first rover that can drill for samples of Mars and analyze them in its built-in lab. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8044.3s)]
*  An early sample told us more about that water that used to be here and led to Curiosity's [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8051.58s)]
*  biggest find so far. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8057.52s)]
*  The water that was on the surface of Mars, you could scoop it up and drink it. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8059.76s)]
*  Rob Manning, chief engineer at JPL, told us because the water was drinkable and because [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8062.96s)]
*  Curiosity also found essential organic chemicals, Mars could have supported life. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8069.46s)]
*  Does that mean life was there? [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8076.4800000000005s)]
*  It doesn't. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8077.56s)]
*  We don't know. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8078.56s)]
*  You're talking about microbial life. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8079.56s)]
*  Microbial single-cell organisms. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8081.240000000001s)]
*  But if you would look for today alive, it wouldn't be on the surface. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8083.240000000001s)]
*  We have to go underground just like we have life on this planet, huge amounts of life [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8087.1s)]
*  living underground on this planet. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8091.56s)]
*  Manning told us life might have traveled back and forth between Mars and Earth. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8093.860000000001s)]
*  When a meteor comes along and hits Mars, a rock from Mars can be lifted up, travel then [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8100.120000000001s)]
*  in circles around the sun until someday it will bump into Earth and land in, say, Antarctica. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8108.1s)]
*  Where a rock from Mars was discovered in 1984. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8116.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8119.14s)]
*  We found Mars rock and we found them all over Earth. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8120.14s)]
*  And the reverse is also true. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8124.04s)]
*  Certainly, Earth rock with life in it has taken a trip to Mars. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8126.22s)]
*  Could that life survive the trip? [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8131.18s)]
*  We believe… [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8133.4400000000005s)]
*  30 million miles? [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8134.4400000000005s)]
*  We don't know. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8135.6s)]
*  We think life might be able to do that. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8136.6s)]
*  Get ready. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8139.68s)]
*  Here's the punch line. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8140.68s)]
*  It could have been that Mars was habitable before Earth was. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8142.5s)]
*  And life got its foothold on Mars and took its journey to Earth. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8146.78s)]
*  And we're all Martians. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8153.62s)]
*  You know how mind-blowing that is? [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8155.1s)]
*  But it's possible. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8157.42s)]
*  Life is amazing. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8158.68s)]
*  Mars could have been habitable when Earth wasn't. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8161.06s)]
*  Because we're looking at rocks that are very, very old. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8163.22s)]
*  How old? [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8166.62s)]
*  I mean, we're talking billions of years. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8167.62s)]
*  Why is it that we can't find rocks here that are as old as on Mars? [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8169.62s)]
*  Most of Earth is constantly recycling as the plates on the surface move around. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8174.54s)]
*  But here on Mars, we don't really have evidence for plate tectonics. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8179.3s)]
*  This is the Mars rock record of Mars history preserved at the surface. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8183.099999999999s)]
*  And that's a really unique opportunity to explore a time in the solar system that may [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8187.14s)]
*  not be preserved on the surface of Earth. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8191.66s)]
*  The scariest part of the entire mission was Curiosity's landing on Mars. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8194.14s)]
*  It couldn't bounce onto Mars cushioned by giant airbags the way smaller rovers had. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8199.779999999999s)]
*  Curiosity weighs a ton, too big for the bags. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8206.019999999999s)]
*  So lead engineer Adam Steltzner and his team came up with a bizarre plan to pack Curiosity [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8209.019999999999s)]
*  into a flying saucer, fire rockets to slow its descent, and then use long cables to [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8216.5s)]
*  lower it onto Mars. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8224.1s)]
*  Many here thought they were crazy. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8226.54s)]
*  The team recognized that if we failed, we would find no comfort or solace from the general [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8229.06s)]
*  public. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8236.66s)]
*  There would be a lot of singers pointed. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8237.66s)]
*  The man on the street says, that looks crazy. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8239.06s)]
*  I could have told you it was crazy. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8241.06s)]
*  And so I developed this little statement I would make before I'd even start. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8243.24s)]
*  It goes like this. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8247.02s)]
*  Great works and great folly may be indistinguishable at the outset. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8249.24s)]
*  Because of the communication time lag, they could not direct the landing from Earth. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8255.72s)]
*  The complex maneuvers were pre-programmed. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8260.92s)]
*  Steltzner and his team could only wait and worry. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8264.199999999999s)]
*  We were just sitting in the control room, pacing back and forth, trying to remember [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8268.22s)]
*  to breathe. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8274.28s)]
*  Steltzner's animation of the landing and the actual reaction at mission control. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8277.4s)]
*  The team celebrated. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8293.96s)]
*  And then sometime in the wee hours of the morning, I went home, crawled into bed with [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8296.44s)]
*  my wife and wept because I was spent. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8300.56s)]
*  I was overwhelmed. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8304.84s)]
*  This is where Curiosity landed. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8307.72s)]
*  The smudges on the left. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8309.64s)]
*  They look like burn marks, but they're not. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8311.34s)]
*  They're dust clearing marks. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8314.2s)]
*  This is where the rockets cleared the dust away. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8315.9s)]
*  I see a trail. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8318.6s)]
*  That's right. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8320.6s)]
*  So these are the tracks of the rover. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8321.6s)]
*  So the rover landed here and then it drove along, made a couple of turns. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8323.24s)]
*  How about that? [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8327.880000000001s)]
*  And you can actually see this from orbit, which is incredible. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8329.28s)]
*  NASA's been sending satellites to Mars for more than 50 years. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8333.04s)]
*  Three are orbiting Mars now, monitoring its weather and sending back images of giant craters, [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8337.640000000001s)]
*  wind carved ridges, and an avalanche of sand pouring down a mountain, kicking up huge clouds [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8344.560000000001s)]
*  of dust. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8351.36s)]
*  Down on the surface, one of the three earlier rovers continues to operate. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8353.04s)]
*  Opportunity is just one fifth the size of Curiosity. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8358.52s)]
*  It can't scoop up samples or analyze the surface the way Curiosity can, but Opportunity [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8362.24s)]
*  has been snapping stunning pictures for 13 years, while Curiosity's mission almost ended [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8368.68s)]
*  after just six months. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8376.08s)]
*  We had had some sort of, the rover had some sort of memory problem. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8378.039999999999s)]
*  Rob Manning told us a computer glitch came within one hour of stopping communication [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8381.8s)]
*  with Curiosity forever. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8387.68s)]
*  The rover has two identical computers called pilot and copilot. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8389.98s)]
*  The pilot is supposed to have enough self-diagnosis, maybe smart enough to say, I'm not doing very [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8394.9s)]
*  well, I'm not feeling well, I'm going to let the copilot take over. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8400.58s)]
*  Yet pilot was not doing well and refused to give up control. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8404.859999999999s)]
*  In fact, it started acting a bit like it had an attitude. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8410.14s)]
*  The computer had an attitude. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8413.66s)]
*  The computer has developed an attitude in a way that we've never, had never seen before. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8414.66s)]
*  When we told it to go take a nap, it refused to take a nap. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8419.26s)]
*  Then it refused to take pictures. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8421.82s)]
*  Then it refused to do more science throughout the day. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8423.7s)]
*  It just stopped doing these things. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8425.66s)]
*  I was like, what the heck is going on? [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8427.58s)]
*  And time is running out. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8429.5s)]
*  Time is running out because in an hour it's going to turn its radio off and stay off forever [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8430.5s)]
*  and we'll lose this very expensive rover. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8435.28s)]
*  Manning's team sent an order to kill the pilot, hoping that would force the copilot to take [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8438.98s)]
*  over. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8445.06s)]
*  We were waiting for the copilot to wake up and then turn on its radio to let us know [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8446.06s)]
*  that it was alive. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8449.619999999999s)]
*  We should get a signal. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8450.619999999999s)]
*  Nothing. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8452.619999999999s)]
*  Another minute goes by, nothing. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8453.619999999999s)]
*  Four minutes go by, now we're starting to get really worried. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8456.939999999999s)]
*  It sounds like a movie. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8459.66s)]
*  It really was getting nerve wracking. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8461.38s)]
*  And bing, there's the signal. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8463.699999999999s)]
*  And the backup pilot was obviously in charge. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8467.18s)]
*  And so... [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8469.5s)]
*  The backup pilot's still in charge today? [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8470.5s)]
*  The backup pilot's still in charge. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8472.14s)]
*  We have since repaired the bad pilot. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8473.88s)]
*  To help direct the pilot, the Jet Propulsion Lab built its own patch of Mars where they [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8477.58s)]
*  can practice maneuvers with the rover's twin. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8482.8s)]
*  Adam Stelzner told us the rover can see where it's going and make mid-course corrections [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8486.0s)]
*  to avoid pitfalls. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8491.74s)]
*  Why is she so slow? [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8494.279999999999s)]
*  We are exploring. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8496.06s)]
*  We don't want to miss anything. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8497.599999999999s)]
*  So she moves deliberately. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8499.439999999999s)]
*  So Katie Stack-Morgan can study everything Curiosity sees. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8503.4s)]
*  This is actually an active dune field. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8508.24s)]
*  What do you mean by an active dune field? [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8509.88s)]
*  It means that the sand particles that are making up the dunes are still moving today. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8511.64s)]
*  Being blown across the landscape. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8517.199999999999s)]
*  They're very slowly being moved across the surface. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8519.52s)]
*  Because of the Martian wind? [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8524.08s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8525.68s)]
*  The guy we talked to talks about how studying Mars helps us better understand Earth. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8526.68s)]
*  How so? [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8533.32s)]
*  When we look at rocks on Mars, we are potentially seeing a snapshot of our solar system at a [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8535.04s)]
*  time before Earth developed its environment as we know it. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8542.56s)]
*  It's really like we were there. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8548.48s)]
*  Now Curiosity has started climbing partway up Mount Sharp. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8550.68s)]
*  That's why it landed nearby. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8555.6s)]
*  The mountain is a layer cake of history, each ascending layer revealing how Mars changed [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8557.68s)]
*  over time. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8564.28s)]
*  The layers at the bottom, those are the older layers and each successive layer is younger [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8565.48s)]
*  and younger and younger. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8569.6s)]
*  As you climb the mountain, what do you expect to find? [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8570.6s)]
*  What do you hope to find? [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8575.12s)]
*  We're actually expecting to see that transition when Mars transitioned from being a habitable [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8576.52s)]
*  planet to being one that was not habitable. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8582.16s)]
*  What happened to the atmosphere of Mars to turn it into this almost dead planet? [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8584.68s)]
*  It cooled, it lost its magnetic field, the solar wind blew away its atmosphere and so [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8590.76s)]
*  it dried out. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8596.16s)]
*  It became a prune of its former self. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8597.74s)]
*  We're still a plum, it's a prune. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8599.68s)]
*  What does that Martian history tell us about Earth? [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8602.4s)]
*  I don't think we have to worry about drying out like Mars. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8606.68s)]
*  But it does teach us- [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8611.08s)]
*  Well that's a relief. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8612.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8613.08s)]
*  It does teach us of how delicate the balance of our environment is. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8614.52s)]
*  And so it should heighten our appreciation of what a beautiful warm wet hug living here [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8620.039999999999s)]
*  on Earth really is. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8627.16s)]
*  How many planets are there? [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8641.0s)]
*  Nine is what we were taught. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8642.92s)]
*  But as telescopes get stronger and astronomers learn more about our solar system, long accepted [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8645.12s)]
*  facts become fallacies. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8651.12s)]
*  Pluto had been considered a planet for 76 years. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8654.04s)]
*  But Pluto lost its planet status after an astronomer at Caltech discovered that Pluto [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8657.8s)]
*  wasn't so special after all. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8664.0s)]
*  His name is Mike Brown. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8667.0s)]
*  Brown and other astronomers have since found hundreds of large balls of ice like Pluto [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8669.56s)]
*  circling the sun at the far reaches of our solar system. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8675.199999999999s)]
*  Demoting Pluto leaves us with eight planets. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8679.48s)]
*  But Mike Brown is preparing another surprise. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8682.92s)]
*  He is sure there is a real ninth planet way out far beyond Pluto. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8685.94s)]
*  He hasn't seen it yet, but he expects too soon. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8691.699999999999s)]
*  He believes the real planet nine is huge and it's out there. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8695.32s)]
*  I would say at this point, I am certain. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8701.279999999999s)]
*  Certain. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8705.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8706.24s)]
*  That's a rare thing to say for a prediction for a scientist. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8707.24s)]
*  And I'm willing to say it. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8711.52s)]
*  You do know how mind boggling this sounds. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8712.8s)]
*  I mean, a new planet hasn't been discovered for 170 years. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8715.16s)]
*  I believe you think it looks like this animation over my shoulder here. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8720.279999999999s)]
*  We took a little artistic license and put some lightning on the dark side of it because [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8724.720000000001s)]
*  it might have lightning on the dark side of it. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8729.0s)]
*  We think that it's somewhere between 10 and 20 times more massive than the Earth. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8730.92s)]
*  And we haven't seen it. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8737.4s)]
*  We can't see it. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8738.76s)]
*  It's so far away that it's actually just at the edge of what our biggest telescopes on [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8740.24s)]
*  the ground can possibly see because it's so far away. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8746.24s)]
*  50 billion miles away. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8749.800000000001s)]
*  It's also hard to find because it has an enormous orbit. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8752.4s)]
*  Planet nine, we think, takes something like 15,000 years to go around the sun. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8756.84s)]
*  15,000 years. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8761.119999999999s)]
*  15,000 years. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8762.119999999999s)]
*  To make one orbit? [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8763.119999999999s)]
*  One orbit. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8764.44s)]
*  To search for planet nine, Brown goes up Mauna Kea, the big mountain on Hawaii's big island, [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8765.44s)]
*  to use the big telescope, the Subaru. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8772.4s)]
*  Brown doesn't look directly through the telescope. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8776.039999999999s)]
*  He monitors pictures it's taking of the same sections of sky on successive nights and then [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8778.84s)]
*  compares them, hunting for movement. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8784.36s)]
*  We have to very systematically look at every patch of sky here, here, here, here. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8787.16s)]
*  And what we're looking for is actually kind of simple. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8793.76s)]
*  We take a picture one night. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8796.94s)]
*  We come back the next night. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8799.24s)]
*  All the stars, all the galaxies are in the same spot night after night after night. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8800.960000000001s)]
*  And planet nine, when we see it, will slowly move across the sky. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8805.46s)]
*  And will look something like this, Brown's discovery 11 years ago that changed the way [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8810.5s)]
*  we think of the solar system. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8816.0s)]
*  Using pictures from successive nights, Brown discovered this Pluto-sized object, which [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8818.82s)]
*  led to the demotion of lovable Pluto. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8824.14s)]
*  You didn't love Pluto growing up? [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8827.32s)]
*  I loved Pluto. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8829.14s)]
*  I was totally fascinated by Pluto. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8830.14s)]
*  When I started in astronomy, I started looking at this region of the sky because I thought [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8832.34s)]
*  it was so interesting out there. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8837.08s)]
*  When Pluto was first discovered, it was thought to be a big planet. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8838.6s)]
*  You can go back and find the New York Times headline on the day that the discovery was [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8843.18s)]
*  announced and it says, a ninth planet discovered in the outer solar system, possibly larger [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8846.380000000001s)]
*  than Jupiter. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8852.880000000001s)]
*  Jupiter's the biggest planet, but Pluto, it turned out, was no Jupiter. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8854.98s)]
*  These are all the planets and other objects at their real relative sizes. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8859.82s)]
*  This is Jupiter. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8866.3s)]
*  Jupiter is huge compared to the other things. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8867.3s)]
*  This is Jupiter. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8869.699999999999s)]
*  This is Saturn without its rings, Uranus, Neptune, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8870.88s)]
*  And at the very edge of the solar system, as we now think of it, is Pluto. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8877.46s)]
*  It's only wrong by a factor of 50,000. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8882.66s)]
*  So it went from being a monster planet to being a dwarf planet. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8885.86s)]
*  A dwarf planet, one of many that are out there that are part of this region of the sky. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8889.539999999999s)]
*  This region is the Kuiper Belt at the edge of our solar system, a vast realm of frozen [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8894.619999999999s)]
*  debris created during the birth of the solar system four and a half billion years ago. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8900.46s)]
*  The Kuiper Belt keeps Brown up all night hunting for discoveries. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8906.279999999999s)]
*  It's the most exciting thing I can think of doing. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8911.119999999999s)]
*  It's not just that it's hard to stay up all night and so I force myself to do it. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8913.38s)]
*  I am excited every night I go out there about what I might find. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8916.94s)]
*  When Mike Brown found that Pluto-sized object, it was the biggest of a group of hundreds [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8921.62s)]
*  of Pluto-like objects recently discovered. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8927.140000000001s)]
*  So Brown wondered, should Pluto really be a planet? [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8930.34s)]
*  But demoting Pluto would mean that every textbook showing planets would have to be changed. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8934.66s)]
*  That was fine with Brown, who believes planets must be significant and that the eight large [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8940.380000000001s)]
*  planets are. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8945.94s)]
*  Their strong gravitational fields control everything around them. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8947.62s)]
*  Planets are the big bullies of the planetary system that basically ignore everybody else [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8952.220000000001s)]
*  around them and everybody else has to deal with the planets. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8957.82s)]
*  Those are what the planets are. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8960.34s)]
*  And Pluto didn't fit that concept. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8961.960000000001s)]
*  Neptune controls Pluto's orbit. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8964.78s)]
*  Neptune is the bully of that neighborhood. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8966.980000000001s)]
*  To resolve the issue, astronomers from all over the world gathered in Prague in 2006. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8969.88s)]
*  The International Astronomical Union would decide whether to demote little Pluto or give [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8976.359999999999s)]
*  planet status to hundreds of similar objects. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8982.039999999999s)]
*  6A is concerned with Pluto and Pluto-like objects. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8985.64s)]
*  Astronomers voted overwhelmingly to go down to eight planets and Brown became known as [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8992.599999999999s)]
*  the guy who killed Pluto. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=8997.84s)]
*  I think that's probably true. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9000.12s)]
*  The Pluto vote was ill-timed for NASA. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9002.9s)]
*  Just seven months before Pluto's demotion, NASA launched a mission to Pluto to learn [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9007.3s)]
*  about its surface and origins. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9012.8s)]
*  Scientists are still analyzing spectacular pictures from NASA's flyby. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9015.86s)]
*  They show Pluto's mostly icy surface and close-ups of craters. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9020.78s)]
*  Now the spaceship is heading deeper into the Kuiper Belt. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9025.92s)]
*  Although Pluto was demoted ten years ago, Pluto lovers still send Brown hate mail and [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9029.76s)]
*  voice mail. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9036.16s)]
*  He kept this one. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9037.44s)]
*  Hey, Pluto's still a planet, you jackass. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9038.92s)]
*  Even Brown's 11-year-old daughter, Lila, didn't like what he had done to Pluto. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9044.16s)]
*  What did you tell him that he should do to make up for that? [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9048.88s)]
*  Well, I told him that if he found a new planet, it might make up for the fact that he killed [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9052.4s)]
*  a planet that everybody loved. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9056.92s)]
*  Seems that he actually went out and did that. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9059.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9061.56s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9062.56s)]
*  It's really great. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9064.36s)]
*  I'm very proud of him. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9065.36s)]
*  She's referring to the huge Planet Nine we mentioned earlier. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9068.4s)]
*  No one was more surprised by that discovery than Brown himself. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9072.6s)]
*  Until recently, he believed our planets would only be the Big Eight. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9077.16s)]
*  And we had explored so much of the solar system beyond those eight that if there were anything [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9081.38s)]
*  else like a planet, we would have found it. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9086.72s)]
*  After all, NASA's spaceships have flown past every known planet, capturing pictures of [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9089.72s)]
*  Saturn's rings, the pockmarked surface of Mercury, the gassy atmosphere of Jupiter. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9095.339999999998s)]
*  And well beyond our solar system, the Hubble Telescope is busy taking pictures of distant [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9102.14s)]
*  galaxies. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9107.539999999999s)]
*  NASA says this single image shows 10,000 galaxies. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9109.26s)]
*  Other pictures show signs of black holes millions of light years away. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9114.18s)]
*  And this one, a glimpse of stars being born. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9118.98s)]
*  No wonder Brown had thought we'd found all our planets. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9122.380000000001s)]
*  So now you think there's another pretty big planet out there. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9125.78s)]
*  Yeah, I am pretty dead certain that it's out there. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9129.34s)]
*  What makes you think that? [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9133.28s)]
*  Because we were studying these objects out beyond Neptune, Pluto and the other objects [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9134.7s)]
*  and the Kuiper belt. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9140.26s)]
*  But when you get to the most distant ones, they all look like they're being pulled off [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9141.26s)]
*  in one direction. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9145.94s)]
*  And you think the thing that's pulling them is a big planet? [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9147.220000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9151.54s)]
*  Couldn't there be some other explanation? [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9152.54s)]
*  We tried many different explanations trying to prove that it wasn't a planet. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9154.78s)]
*  Nothing, nothing works. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9159.140000000001s)]
*  I am 100% convinced. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9160.94s)]
*  Brown's partner, Konstantin Batygin, a planetary science professor at Caltech, came up with [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9163.380000000001s)]
*  this mathematical proof. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9168.98s)]
*  Proof he says that Planet Nine is pulling those remote objects in similar oblong orbits. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9171.58s)]
*  It looks like mathematical gibberish to our untrained eye, but Batygin told us his equation [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9178.68s)]
*  melds 10 accepted formulas and when coupled with more than 8,000 lines of computer code, [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9184.84s)]
*  it describes Planet Nine's orbit. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9191.66s)]
*  So he says he doesn't have to see it to know it exists. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9194.539999999999s)]
*  The mathematics proves it. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9198.539999999999s)]
*  And it's like being downtown and hearing an ambulance a few streets away. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9202.34s)]
*  You haven't seen it, but your other senses provide you with the information that really [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9209.48s)]
*  this ambulance is really there. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9214.539999999999s)]
*  Here instead of hearing it, you see it in the math. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9216.38s)]
*  This is a roadmap to Planet Nine. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9219.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9222.820000000002s)]
*  This in the end tells you where to look on the sky. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9223.94s)]
*  To speed up the search, Batygin and Brown published their roadmap so other astronomers [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9228.460000000001s)]
*  could join the hunt. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9233.300000000001s)]
*  Foremost among them is Scott Shepard of the Carnegie Institution. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9235.18s)]
*  It was Shepard who first spotted the odd orbits in the Kuiper Belt that led Mike Brown to [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9239.480000000001s)]
*  conclude there's a huge planet out there. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9244.78s)]
*  Now Shepard, like Brown, compares the pictures taken on consecutive nights hoping to spot [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9248.08s)]
*  Planet Nine. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9254.36s)]
*  We just found some more small objects very far in the solar system that continue to show [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9255.74s)]
*  the trend that there should be a Planet Nine out there. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9260.88s)]
*  Is it important to you whether you are the first to find it or another astronomer finds [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9263.28s)]
*  it? [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9268.32s)]
*  It would be great to be the first one to find it. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9269.32s)]
*  It is a race. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9270.58s)]
*  There's a lot of people looking for it, but just to have it found is what we want. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9271.58s)]
*  When do you think we might actually identify, spot, Planet Nine? [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9275.6s)]
*  I think that within three years we will be able to cover that swath of sky that we need [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9281.220000000001s)]
*  to cover. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9287.800000000001s)]
*  Is this giant Planet Nine the last planet we'll find in our solar system or is there [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9288.800000000001s)]
*  a Planet Ten? [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9296.04s)]
*  Is there a Planet Ten? [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9297.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9298.04s)]
*  We don't know. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9299.04s)]
*  Planet Nine is already far enough away that it requires the biggest telescopes we have [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9300.04s)]
*  to find it. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9303.86s)]
*  Planet Ten is even further. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9304.86s)]
*  Planet Nine is our generation's planet. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9306.42s)]
*  It's the perfect planet to find right now. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9310.42s)]
*  Planet Ten? [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9313.74s)]
*  This is when I talk to kids. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9314.74s)]
*  I tell them, Planet Ten, it's yours. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9316.18s)]
*  Go find it. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9318.380000000001s)]
*  President Obama canceled NASA's plan to replace the space shuttle in favor of a more modest [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9335.7s)]
*  program and then Congress slashed the funding for that. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9340.26s)]
*  So for the first time in 50 years, America is not the leader in spaceflight. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9344.58s)]
*  Fact is, we couldn't launch an astronaut today if we had to. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9350.42s)]
*  With the end of an era, we wondered what would happen to the generation that put America [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9355.2s)]
*  in space. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9359.960000000001s)]
*  So last July, when the smoke cleared from the last space shuttle launch, we stayed behind [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9361.38s)]
*  in Brevard County, Florida, the home of the Kennedy Space Center. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9366.939999999999s)]
*  What comes after reaching for the stars? [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9371.199999999999s)]
*  For many in Brevard County, the answer is a hard landing. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9373.859999999999s)]
*  There was nothing like it in the world. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9383.22s)]
*  And liftoff, the final liftoff of Atlantis. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9385.46s)]
*  Arguably the greatest engineering achievement of man. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9389.62s)]
*  At liftoff, it weighed four and a half million pounds. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9393.3s)]
*  Its top speed, 17,000 miles an hour. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9397.22s)]
*  Space shuttle spreads its wings one final time from the start of a sentimental journey [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9401.26s)]
*  into history. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9405.26s)]
*  It was built by the hands of people like Lou Hanna. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9406.66s)]
*  It was the experience and the job of a lifetime. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9410.34s)]
*  I was working on a pad one day with a friend of mine, and he's a crane operator too. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9419.1s)]
*  And I asked him, I said, how many other crane operators do you suppose that there are doing [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9424.18s)]
*  what we're doing? [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9437.380000000001s)]
*  There's two, you and me. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9439.380000000001s)]
*  There was enormous pride in doing for America what no other workers in the world could even [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9444.54s)]
*  dare. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9451.380000000001s)]
*  Lou Hanna manned a gigantic crane that cleared the platform before launch. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9452.62s)]
*  He worked on the first shuttle in 1981 and the last 135 missions later. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9458.62s)]
*  What did seeing the last shuttle launch mean to you? [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9468.3s)]
*  I felt anger. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9474.019999999999s)]
*  Anger? [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9476.019999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, because this does not have to be the last launch. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9477.019999999999s)]
*  It doesn't have to end this way. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9481.5s)]
*  I mean it just doesn't make any sense. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9483.539999999999s)]
*  It doesn't compute. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9487.019999999999s)]
*  And I guess I'm still in denial because I'm thinking they're going to call me back one [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9488.019999999999s)]
*  day we've got a launch coming up and we need your help. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9491.46s)]
*  How can they do that? [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9496.66s)]
*  They did it to save $3 billion a year. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9499.220000000001s)]
*  Now the only way an American can fly into space is to buy a seat on a Russian rocket. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9502.7s)]
*  At the Kennedy Space Center, 7,000 workers lost their jobs. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9511.02s)]
*  Main gear touchdown. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9516.5s)]
*  The space shuttle pulls into port for the last time. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9517.5s)]
*  50 years of liftoffs are becoming eight months of layoffs. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9521.86s)]
*  Have a look around Brevard County. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9526.58s)]
*  It's shrinking. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9528.94s)]
*  Lots of people are moving away, taking businesses down with them. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9530.26s)]
*  It was like bam, gone, gone, gone. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9534.42s)]
*  The work ethic that built the shuttle keeps Chris Milner fighting to hang on. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9539.08s)]
*  How long did you work at the space center? [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9544.18s)]
*  Eight years. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9545.86s)]
*  And your wife? [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9546.86s)]
*  29 years. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9547.86s)]
*  Both laid off? [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9548.86s)]
*  Both laid off. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9549.86s)]
*  In the spirit of an entrepreneur, Milner planned for the layoffs. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9551.26s)]
*  Five years ago he launched a landscape business on the side and then he added a sign shop [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9555.14s)]
*  in this industrial park. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9560.66s)]
*  Still, there was one thing he didn't plan on. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9562.7s)]
*  Seafood is gone. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9565.98s)]
*  There's nothing there. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9567.78s)]
*  Edward's exterminating is the only one that's left. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9568.78s)]
*  It's right around the corner. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9570.7s)]
*  But basically everything's empty. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9572.94s)]
*  It's a nightmare. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9575.5s)]
*  Everybody's been laid off. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9576.5s)]
*  It's a ripple effect. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9578.1s)]
*  Everybody's closing down. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9580.22s)]
*  It affects everybody else. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9581.22s)]
*  And it affects man. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9583.539999999999s)]
*  The 7,000 layoffs at the space center triggered 7,000 more in the community. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9585.699999999999s)]
*  Unemployment has been close to 11%. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9591.42s)]
*  People are moving away. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9594.9s)]
*  People are going up north. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9595.98s)]
*  Nothing's happening here. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9597.66s)]
*  I know people who move all the way to Seattle for a job, left their house, left the key [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9598.859999999999s)]
*  in the front door. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9604.5s)]
*  Here you go. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9606.019999999999s)]
*  It's gone. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9607.019999999999s)]
*  It's gone. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9608.02s)]
*  Milner had 12 employees in the lawn business. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9609.02s)]
*  Now he has three. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9613.5s)]
*  You know, you're running these two businesses. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9615.300000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9617.140000000001s)]
*  How many hours a day are you working? [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9618.140000000001s)]
*  Literally. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9620.34s)]
*  Literally. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9621.34s)]
*  I'm here at 7 a.m. in the morning and in the last couple weeks I've been here until one, [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9622.34s)]
*  two o'clock in the morning. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9626.82s)]
*  My last day office, Christmas. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9628.66s)]
*  Working 17 hours a day, seven days a week. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9632.300000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9635.66s)]
*  Can't be all that good for your health. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9636.66s)]
*  No. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9638.3s)]
*  My wife's worried. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9639.3s)]
*  She's scared. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9640.3s)]
*  She's told me that. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9641.3s)]
*  And she's taken out a life insurance policy on him. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9642.3s)]
*  But at the same time she knows what I got to do and the problem is we have a 12 year [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9645.22s)]
*  old at the house that doesn't understand because he's never had to go without. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9650.02s)]
*  He's constantly asking for McDonald's. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9654.58s)]
*  We don't get McDonald's anymore. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9657.02s)]
*  This isn't the first hard landing on the space coast. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9660.06s)]
*  There were big layoffs in 1972 after the last mission to the moon. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9663.22s)]
*  But here's why today is worse. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9667.9s)]
*  When we left the moon, NASA was already years into designing the shuttle and it looked like [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9670.34s)]
*  it would be that way now because President Bush approved a program to follow the shuttle. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9675.699999999999s)]
*  The new manned space program rocket was supposed to be called Constellation and now you guys [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9681.42s)]
*  call it Cancellation. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9686.58s)]
*  Cancellation, unfortunately. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9687.58s)]
*  Lou Hanna and Joe Yurick, Holly Petrucci and Mike Carpenter planned to transfer from shuttle [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9690.66s)]
*  to Constellation. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9696.18s)]
*  They were encouraged when candidate Barack Obama came to Brevard County in 2008, three [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9697.78s)]
*  months before the election. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9703.38s)]
*  I'm going to ensure that our space program doesn't suffer when the shuttle goes out of [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9704.74s)]
*  service by making sure that all those who work in the space industry in Florida do not [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9709.14s)]
*  lose their jobs when the shuttle is retired because we can't afford to lose their expertise. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9714.58s)]
*  Well, we were lied to when Obama came through. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9721.14s)]
*  It gave us a lot of hope and supposedly a lot of change. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9724.98s)]
*  Well, I've got change in my pocket but the hope is gone. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9728.58s)]
*  In 2010, President Obama canceled Constellation and turned over development of a new spaceship [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9731.82s)]
*  to private enterprise. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9737.859999999999s)]
*  Then, Congress dealt another blow by cutting the funding for the Obama plan in half. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9739.5s)]
*  At the very least, it will be five years before America flies astronauts again. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9746.34s)]
*  Now, the workers with that expertise Mr. Obama referred to are setting course for Carol Bess. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9751.54s)]
*  And I've had several who've told me I was considering suicide before I came to you. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9758.94s)]
*  Carol Bess is a bankruptcy attorney. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9763.460000000001s)]
*  What drove them to that point? [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9766.14s)]
*  They felt like failures. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9768.58s)]
*  You know, here I am, I can't pay my debts and I'm probably worth more dead than alive [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9770.94s)]
*  if I have life insurance. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9776.1s)]
*  And folks either aren't finding work or if they do, they're making a lot less than they [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9777.58s)]
*  were before. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9781.74s)]
*  Correct. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9782.74s)]
*  And that's not going to change. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9783.74s)]
*  These people have no hope. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9785.1s)]
*  It could still get a lot worse, I think. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9786.58s)]
*  Following the Great Recession, we visited a lot of communities that lost their main employer [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9790.460000000001s)]
*  but never one like Brevard County. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9794.86s)]
*  We learned about the sense of loss with our first question to Lucas Maxwell who used to [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9798.140000000001s)]
*  handle the dangerous fuel for the rockets. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9803.42s)]
*  What was it like when it was launched? [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9806.460000000001s)]
*  Paint that picture for me. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9809.9s)]
*  The thought was too much for a moment. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9818.26s)]
*  Then he came back to tell us why. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9820.66s)]
*  Made your heart stop. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9823.02s)]
*  It's awesome no matter what. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9824.86s)]
*  You know, the pride that goes into a vehicle like that. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9827.54s)]
*  I knew it was the end too. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9831.66s)]
*  I knew I was going to be out on the street. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9832.66s)]

*  Oh yeah, absolutely. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9840.54s)]
*  This is a matter of national pride. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9841.54s)]
*  The end of the shuttle is threatening businesses that families have built over decades, like [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9846.98s)]
*  shuttles, the first bar you come to leaving the Space Center. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9852.52s)]
*  Not just a bar really, it's the place where astronauts land. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9857.24s)]
*  In July, before the last launch, we stopped in to see owner Bill Grillo. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9861.28s)]
*  How many employees did you have at the peak? [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9865.92s)]
*  We had 25. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9868.199999999999s)]
*  And now? [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9869.64s)]
*  We're down to eight. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9870.64s)]
*  And you're one of them? [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9872.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9874.4s)]
*  If it comes down to just myself, my son and a cook, well hang on, shuttles will be here. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9875.4s)]
*  I won't let it go. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9881.039999999999s)]
*  Seven months later, this is shuttles today. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9883.28s)]
*  I'm sorry about this. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9886.24s)]
*  When we were here before, you were optimistic. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9888.32s)]
*  You said this place wouldn't close. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9891.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9893.96s)]
*  Within 45 days after the last shuttle, we lost 70% of our business. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9895.08s)]
*  We weren't able to sustain. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9902.36s)]
*  As much as it killed me to do that, I had to. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9903.96s)]
*  And you've been gone for a couple of months now. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9909.5s)]
*  But I don't think you've moved a thing in here. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9912.42s)]
*  I can't right now. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9915.26s)]
*  It's too painful to do that. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9917.02s)]
*  I got a lot of, a lot of my heart is here. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9921.86s)]
*  And I can't take anything off the walls yet. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9927.06s)]
*  It's not just a business. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9929.9s)]
*  No. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9931.62s)]
*  No. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9932.62s)]
*  This is an institution. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9933.62s)]
*  And I don't want to be the one that takes it apart. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9939.86s)]
*  No one we met back in July expected to be the one to take apart the life they'd known. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9945.62s)]
*  Some were the second or third generation in their family to work at the Space Center. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9950.86s)]
*  Before the last launch, we met several at a job center applying for the remaining aerospace [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9956.34s)]
*  work. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9961.5s)]
*  Sammy Rivera worked on the shuttle 26 years, reviewing engineering drawings. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9962.5s)]
*  I figured the day I wake up dead, I won't go to work. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9967.66s)]
*  It's the bottom line. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9971.82s)]
*  There's not going to be anything for me to retire on. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9973.14s)]

*  You didn't expect to be unemployed 11 months and counting. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9977.74s)]
*  At the max, I figured three months. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9984.099999999999s)]
*  I've applied for engineering jobs. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=9987.539999999999s)]

*  No, sir. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10004.58s)]
*  No, sir. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10005.58s)]
*  My health insurance terminated on my last day of employment. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10007.08s)]
*  How are you getting along? [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10010.88s)]
*  A lot of prayer. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10012.88s)]
*  The medications that I was on, out of pocket expense, runs me over $800 a month. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10019.6s)]
*  With no money coming in, I can't afford that. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10029.68s)]
*  So he's taking only one of the two pills that his doctors say he has to take to avoid [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10035.64s)]
*  a heart attack. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10041.28s)]
*  You know when you're raising that flag in your front yard? [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10043.14s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10045.48s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10046.48s)]
*  This is my country. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10051.800000000001s)]
*  And I can't let it go down without a fight. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10054.32s)]
*  The four remaining shuttles are headed to museums. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10060.32s)]
*  Atlantis will be on display at the Kennedy Space Center. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10063.800000000001s)]

*  Like so many in Brevard County, Florida, she was pulled from the service of her country [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10072.44s)]
*  long before she was ready. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10077.68s)]
*  For decades, the U.S. has relied on spy satellites to look deep inside the territory of its [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10090.68s)]
*  adversaries. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10096.68s)]
*  These giant billion-dollar satellites take high-resolution photographs which can see [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10098.36s)]
*  objects as small as a fist inside Russia, North Korea, or wherever the target is. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10102.880000000001s)]
*  Tonight, we will take you inside the intelligence agency where those photos are analyzed. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10108.84s)]

*  satellites. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10119.4s)]
*  A private company named Planet Labs has put about 300 small satellites into space, enough [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10120.4s)]
*  to take a picture of the entire landmass of the Earth every day. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10126.88s)]
*  Those small satellites have created a big data problem for the government which can't [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10131.8s)]
*  possibly hire enough analysts to look at all those pictures. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10136.4s)]
*  Welcome to the revolution. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10141.039999999999s)]
*  Five, four, three, two, one. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10143.039999999999s)]
*  This is how the revolution began. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10150.039999999999s)]
*  Twenty-eight small satellites sent out into orbit by astronauts from the biggest of all [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10152.8s)]
*  satellites, the International Space Station. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10158.279999999999s)]
*  We took a satellite that would be the size of a pickup truck and we shrunk it. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10161.8s)]
*  We wanted to make it about the size of a loaf of bread. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10166.4s)]
*  Robbie Schengler began building satellites 20 years ago, working for NASA. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10169.76s)]
*  The way that I grew up at NASA is we would spend about five to ten years even to build [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10174.16s)]
*  one satellite. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10181.48s)]

*  This is our satellite manufacturing building. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10185.88s)]
*  A company that turns out satellites in months, not years. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10188.32s)]
*  You can pick these up. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10192.02s)]
*  They're about 12 pounds or five kilograms. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10193.02s)]
*  Packed with some of the same electronics used in smartphones, they're built by hand in a [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10196.96s)]

*  I know, isn't that cool? [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10214.720000000001s)]
*  And frankly, we're just getting started. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10215.84s)]
*  How many have you built over the years? [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10218.34s)]
*  Oh, over the years we've built about 300 satellites over the years and last year we launched about [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10219.84s)]
*  146 satellites into space. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10225.84s)]
*  The satellites are called Doves. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10229.2s)]
*  Here on the production floor they are kept in nests waiting to be launched in flocks. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10231.44s)]
*  This is a visualization that shows every satellite that we have up in space today. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10237.02s)]
*  This is mission control? [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10241.800000000001s)]
*  This is mission control, yeah. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10242.800000000001s)]
*  It's a little bit of a let down. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10243.800000000001s)]
*  But it's a little bit non-traditional. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10246.0s)]
*  A normal mission control, you will have dozens and dozens of engineers for one satellite. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10247.0s)]
*  We flip that around. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10253.54s)]
*  So we have dozens of satellites for a single engineer. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10255.04s)]
*  The satellites orbit the globe every 90 minutes while the Earth rotates beneath them. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10259.720000000001s)]

*  I'm always astonished that almost every picture we get down, we compare it to the picture [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10269.0s)]
*  from yesterday and something's changed. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10272.960000000001s)]
*  Will Marshall is another of the company's founders. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10275.44s)]
*  We see rivers move, we see trees go down, we see vehicles move, we see road surfaces [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10278.320000000002s)]
*  And it gives you a perspective of the planet as a dynamic and evolving thing that we need [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10283.08s)]
*  to take care of. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10289.0s)]
*  Is that what people are supposed to conclude from seeing all this change? [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10290.04s)]
*  Well, you can't fix what you can't see. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10294.68s)]
*  That kind of save the world ambition carries a big risk, especially for a small firm that's [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10299.02s)]
*  just getting started. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10304.44s)]
*  Planet has many records. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10307.560000000001s)]
*  We've launched the most satellites in the world ever, but we've also lost the most satellites [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10308.6s)]

*  to see the launch. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10327.199999999999s)]
*  It was very embarrassing. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10328.199999999999s)]

*  26. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10349.4s)]

*  How long did it take you to get back to normal? [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10357.56s)]
*  We didn't even skip a beat when that happened. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10361.039999999999s)]
*  We only lose a day. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10364.599999999999s)]
*  On the day we visited Planet, its satellites were beaming down 1.2 million pictures every [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10365.599999999999s)]
*  24 hours. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10371.519999999999s)]
*  Planet sells images to over 200 customers, many of them agricultural companies monitoring [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10374.08s)]
*  the health of crops. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10379.88s)]
*  But this is Planet's most important customer. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10382.0s)]
*  This is our operation center, heartbeat of the agency. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10384.72s)]
*  Robert Cardillo is director of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, NGA for short, [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10388.56s)]
*  the organization which analyzes satellite photos. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10395.0s)]
*  So this really is ground zero for all the intelligence coming in from space. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10398.279999999999s)]
*  That's correct. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10403.08s)]
*  It's where we bring in all of our sources, whether they come from space or any source. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10404.08s)]
*  But correct, it's ground zero. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10408.039999999999s)]
*  Because 60 Minutes was allowed into this secure operation center, top secret high resolution [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10410.199999999999s)]

*  I'm quite excited about capabilities such as what Planet's putting up in space. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10439.04s)]
*  Planet is a small company with just over 400 employees, many of them in San Francisco. [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10444.92s)]
*  NGA is a government bureaucracy with a workforce of 14,500 and a 2.7 million square foot headquarters [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10450.92s)]
*  south of Washington, D.C. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10460.24s)]
*  But Robert Cardillo knew a revolution when he saw one. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10462.96s)]
*  This is not the scale model. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10466.32s)]
*  This is the real size. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10468.119999999999s)]
*  When Planet's Will Marshall unveiled his small satellite at a 2014 TED Talk, Cardillo showed [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10469.400000000001s)]
*  the video to his workforce. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10475.560000000001s)]
*  It's going to provide a completely radical new data set about our changing planet. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10477.04s)]
*  And a radical new culture. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10482.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10483.68s)]
*  The planet openly markets its images. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10484.68s)]
*  NGA's spy photos rarely see the light of day. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10487.16s)]
*  The intelligence analyst who leaked these photos of a Russian shipyard in 1984 went [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10491.0s)]
*  to prison. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10496.32s)]
*  What NGA can see from space is top secret. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10497.8s)]
*  How many of these high resolution satellites do you operate? [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10501.24s)]
*  I'll not comment. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10505.44s)]
*  But much of what Cardillo won't talk about is common knowledge to Ted Moksa, who is a [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10508.36s)]
*  household name in the obscure world of amateur satellite tracking. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10513.56s)]
*  How many photo satellites does the U.S. have in orbit? [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10518.48s)]
*  Currently there are three. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10523.039999999999s)]
*  Liftoff of NROL-71 for the National Reconnaissance Office. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10525.0s)]
*  Since we interviewed Moksa on what looks like a fourth photo satellite has been launched, [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10529.08s)]
*  he tracks them from his balcony in downtown Toronto with nothing more sophisticated than [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10534.2s)]
*  $300 binoculars. [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10539.16s)]
*  You just wait for a flyby from the satellite? [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10541.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10544.24s)]
*  I'm laying in wait. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10545.24s)]
*  For something that's 150 miles away going five miles a second? [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10546.24s)]
*  Yes. [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10549.56s)]
*  And it will cross my field of view in a few seconds. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10550.56s)]
*  So I've got to be on the ball. [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10553.4s)]
*  Here's what a top secret satellite looks like from Earth, captured on video by one of about [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10555.16s)]
*  20 amateur trackers around the world. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10559.92s)]
*  Its code name is Crystal. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10562.68s)]
*  This thing is about the size of a city bus. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10564.72s)]
*  And this is what it looks like from Earth. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10566.92s)]
*  That's right. [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10568.88s)]
*  It just looks like a moving star. [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10569.88s)]
*  The satellite trackers watch as it streaks across the sky, measuring its position against [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10571.48s)]
*  well-known stars. [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10576.359999999999s)]
*  That's enough to tell the orbit of the satellite. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10578.4s)]
*  Yes. [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10580.96s)]
*  We're doing this with our eyes, often with cameras. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10581.96s)]
*  But the end result of it is numbers. [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10585.08s)]
*  And if we pull enough of that data together, we can actually calculate the orbit to great [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10586.759999999998s)]
*  precision. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10591.24s)]
*  If you've been able to calculate this, presumably the North Koreans have been able to calculate [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10592.439999999999s)]
*  this. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10599.039999999999s)]
*  Absolutely, yes. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10600.039999999999s)]
*  So there's no mystery to the North Koreans, the Russians, the Iranians, the Chinese, when [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10601.039999999999s)]
*  these satellites are overhead taking pictures. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10607.039999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10610.119999999999s)]
*  Space Age hide and seek. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10611.72s)]
*  Adversaries know when and where American spy satellites are looking, but can never be sure [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10614.32s)]
*  what they're finding. [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10618.76s)]
*  This is what NGA developed in the pursuit of Osama bin Laden. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10620.76s)]
*  Before President Obama and his national security team, including Cardillo there on the left, [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10627.32s)]
*  gathered in the White House Situation Room on the night of the raid, NGA had gone back [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10632.64s)]
*  in time, through seven years of satellite imagery, to construct this scale model of [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10637.68s)]
*  bin Laden's hideout. [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10643.64s)]
*  We had historic imagery of this compound that enabled us to reverse time. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10645.28s)]
*  NGA could see not just the outside, but inside as well. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10650.04s)]
*  It enabled us to go back to the point of construction and essentially, through our imagery archive, [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10655.02s)]
*  to rebuild the house. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10660.960000000001s)]
*  So we could see how the first floor was designed and how the rooms would lay out, where are [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10662.52s)]
*  the stairs from the first to the second floor and the second to the third floor. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10667.960000000001s)]
*  So old pictures showed that building before the roof went off. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10672.4s)]
*  We had pictures before the compound existed. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10675.84s)]
*  We saw it when it was first constructed and as it was built over time, correct? [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10678.36s)]
*  And that's how you could find out the dimensions of each room. [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10682.880000000001s)]
*  Indeed. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10686.560000000001s)]
*  The satellites that made that possible are the equivalent of a Hubble Space Telescope. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10687.76s)]
*  But instead of taking pictures of the heavens, they are zeroed in on Earth, able to make [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10691.92s)]
*  out objects just four inches across. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10697.76s)]
*  For decades, they have been indispensable to knowing what America's adversaries are [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10702.8s)]
*  up to. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10706.76s)]
*  But like Hubble, they cost billions of dollars each, which is one reason there are so few [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10708.3s)]
*  in orbit. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10713.48s)]
*  Are they putting more up? [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10714.48s)]
*  They've never had more than four up at a time. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10717.08s)]
*  Which is why Cardillo is so interested in planet and its small satellites that deliver [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10720.0s)]
*  a tsunami of data like NGA has never seen. [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10725.2s)]
*  How many analysts would it take to keep up with those number of satellites? [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10729.0s)]
*  We did some calculations and we came up with six million humans would need to be hired [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10734.16s)]
*  to exploit all the imagery that we have access to. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10742.9s)]
*  You can see that it's not exactly a viable proposition. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10746.34s)]
*  If you were trying to find this in Syria, it's sort of like a needle in a haystack, [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10750.08s)]
*  right? [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10754.7s)]
*  Planet Shauna-Wolverton showed us how a computer can be programmed to help track the impact [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10755.7s)]
*  of Syria's civil war on the people who live there. [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10760.74s)]
*  So what we've done is created an algorithm that looks for new roads and buildings. [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10763.98s)]
*  An algorithm that rifled through reams of satellite photos and identified the first [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10770.2s)]
*  signs of a new refugee camp. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10774.62s)]
*  Here's that first image. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10777.52s)]
*  So that red grid is what? [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10778.740000000002s)]
*  Those are new roads and all of these blue spots that you can see here are buildings. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10781.44s)]
*  So this is one little corner of Syria. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10788.18s)]
*  Could you do this for the entire country? [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10793.6s)]
*  We could absolutely do this for the entire country. [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10796.36s)]
*  I can show you over here. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10798.300000000001s)]
*  We can zoom out. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10799.34s)]
*  You can see that we've run this algorithm over the entire country and you can see all [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10802.460000000001s)]
*  of the roads and buildings. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10806.78s)]
*  This is the first photo an American spy satellite ever took from space in 1960, a far-off look [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10810.82s)]
*  at a Russian airfield. [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10817.82s)]
*  Since then, we have gotten much more spectacular looks at Earth, like these taken by the Apollo [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10820.460000000001s)]
*  astronauts. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10826.18s)]
*  But the U.S. government no longer holds a monopoly on photos from space and has no [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10827.380000000001s)]

*  And not all of them are going to be good. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10851.74s)]
*  No. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10854.06s)]
*  You worry about that? [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10855.06s)]
*  I worry a lot. [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10856.06s)]
*  And we wouldn't have started Planet if we didn't have a very strong conviction that [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10858.1s)]
*  the vast majority of the use cases are very, very positive. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10864.14s)]
*  This December 22nd may become known as the day the universe changed. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10867.78s)]
*  That Wednesday, NASA expects to launch the James Webb Space Telescope, the largest and [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10887.66s)]
*  most expensive instrument ever flown. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10894.58s)]
*  One hundred times more powerful than the 31-year-old Hubble Telescope, Webb can see back in time [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10897.9s)]
*  all the way to the let there be light moment, that instant when a cold, dark universe ignited [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10904.66s)]

*  Wow. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10915.66s)]
*  Well somehow that's a lot bigger than I imagined. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10918.86s)]
*  She's a big one. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10922.06s)]
*  A year ago, we were among the last humans to see the telescope much as it will appear [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10923.54s)]
*  in space. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10928.62s)]
*  After our visit, it was packed away for a journey of a million miles, far beyond the [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10930.380000000001s)]
*  moon, to lie forever in the grasp of the sun. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10936.18s)]
*  The operating life is how long? [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10940.560000000001s)]
*  It's designed for five and a half years with a goal of ten years. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10943.900000000001s)]
*  So that means we carry enough stuff on there to last for ten years. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10947.66s)]
*  Amy Lowe is a systems engineer who took us up in the clean room at Northrop Grumman in [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10954.02s)]
*  Redondo Beach, California. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10960.02s)]
*  We had to invent it, design it, build it, and hand put it together. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10962.1s)]
*  At the bottom of the spacecraft, that silver shroud is a parasol, big as a tennis court, [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10967.34s)]
*  to shield Webb from the sun. [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10973.92s)]
*  Above, there are 21 feet of gold-plated mirrors, six times bigger than Hubble's mirror, to [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10976.300000000001s)]
*  catch the earliest starlight in creation. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10983.220000000001s)]
*  There are 18 of these hexagonal mirrors, but when you fold them out, they all work in concert [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10986.9s)]
*  as one mirror. [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10995.0s)]
*  That's right. [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10996.0s)]
*  All 18 images will form one very nice, solid image. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=10997.0s)]
*  That image would be invisible to the human eye. [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11002.3s)]
*  Like a night vision camera, Webb is designed to see heat, infrared light, because that's [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11005.939999999999s)]
*  the only signature left from the stars at the edge of time. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11012.64s)]
*  Even that glow will be so dim, the mirrors will have to squint for hours to expose an [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11017.38s)]
*  image. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11023.74s)]
*  How much confidence do you have? [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11025.019999999999s)]
*  You know, my job is to worry. [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11027.5s)]
*  I personally feel confident that we have thought of everything. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11031.7s)]
*  Thinking of everything took more than 25 years and $10 billion. [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11038.86s)]
*  Engineer Amy Lowe explained the challenge. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11045.220000000001s)]
*  In my mind, the biggest engineering challenge was to build a sun shield capable of shielding [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11048.02s)]
*  the optics, the mirrors, and the instrument on Webb. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11055.220000000001s)]
*  How do you build something big but lightweight? [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11059.18s)]
*  The sun shield keeps Webb cold and dark. [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11062.380000000001s)]
*  Any infrared heat from the sun or earth would blind the telescope. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11065.26s)]
*  The five layers are made of gossamer sheets not unlike Mylar birthday balloons. [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11070.52s)]
*  The layer facing the sun is layer one, and layer one reaches about 230 degrees Fahrenheit, [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11076.7s)]
*  so a pretty warm oven, like if you wanted to cook a meringue or something. [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11082.78s)]
*  And on the telescope side? [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11086.54s)]
*  On the telescope side, it gets to negative 370 degrees Fahrenheit. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11089.1s)]
*  There's a roughly 600 degree difference between one side of the heat shield and the other. [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11094.58s)]
*  Yes, it's amazing that it's able to do this with nothing more than these layers. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11100.54s)]
*  The engineering is amazing, but the science may reveal the universe. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11107.86s)]
*  Since the beginning, the Big Bang, the arrow of time has flown nearly 14 billion years. [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11114.22s)]
*  Webb may see all the way back to the first 100 million, the baby universe. [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11121.539999999999s)]
*  Amber Strawn is an astrophysicist on the project. [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11129.34s)]
*  Telescopes really are time machines. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11133.42s)]
*  They literally allow us to see into the past. [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11135.179999999998s)]
*  And the reason for that is just due to the nature of how light travels. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11139.14s)]
*  The journey from the sun takes about eight minutes to get to the earth. [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11143.14s)]
*  So we're seeing the sun as it was eight minutes ago. [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11145.859999999999s)]
*  And you can sort of think about stepping that further out into the universe. [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11148.859999999999s)]
*  So when we walk out under the stars and look above us, we're not seeing the stars as they are today. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11152.66s)]
*  We're seeing them as they were perhaps millions of years ago. [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11159.98s)]
*  Absolutely. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11163.619999999999s)]
*  Because it took that long for the light to reach the earth. [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11164.619999999999s)]
*  Yes, for sure. [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11167.779999999999s)]
*  How much do we know about the universe? [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11169.34s)]
*  Everything we know about, everything we can see, me and you, everything on the planet, [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11172.78s)]
*  all the hundreds of billions of other galaxies, all of that only makes up about 5% of the universe. [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11177.5s)]
*  The rest of it, that other 95%, we have no idea what it is. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11184.5s)]
*  That 95%, the unknown, is all around us like a ghost. [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11189.02s)]
*  Nearly all the cosmos is made up of what physicists call, in desperation, dark matter and dark energy. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11194.82s)]
*  Never seen. [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11202.98s)]
*  Scientists infer they must exist because they're the best explanation for how galaxies form and move. [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11204.26s)]
*  So we know that dark matter is sort of the scaffolding of the universe. [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11212.779999999999s)]
*  It's the structure on which galaxies sit. [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11217.5s)]
*  And if there wasn't dark matter, there wouldn't be galaxies and there wouldn't be us. [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11221.1s)]
*  What might the Webb Telescope reveal about dark matter? [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11225.42s)]
*  It's like we have this 14 billion year old story of the universe, but we're missing that first chapter. [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11229.9s)]
*  And Webb was specifically designed to allow us to see those very first galaxies that formed after the Big Bang. [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11235.619999999999s)]
*  Now, galaxies are born and then they evolve, they change over time. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11243.46s)]
*  And this way that galaxies change must rely critically on dark matter. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11247.86s)]
*  And Webb is going to allow us to observe that process of galaxy evolution in much more detail. [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11254.02s)]
*  The promise of discovery shielded Webb on what's already been a treacherous journey. [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11260.38s)]
*  It was to launch seven years ago, but delays come with a machine this ambitious. [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11266.46s)]
*  Because of cost overruns, Webb was canceled in 2011 by the House Appropriations Committee, but it was saved in the Senate. [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11272.62s)]
*  Its namesake is James Webb, head of NASA in the 1960s, who made science a top priority. [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11281.5s)]
*  What are the stakes? What's riding on that rocket with Webb? [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11289.02s)]
*  When you talk about what's at stake, it really is NASA's reputation to take on a mission that is as challenging as Webb and be successful. [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11292.86s)]
*  Bill Oakes and Greg Robinson run the program. Oakes was an engineer on Hubble. Robinson has supervised NASA quality and performance. [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11301.7s)]
*  If you want to be bold and get the kind of science we're after, you have to make the investment. [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11311.06s)]
*  And it's going to answer two big questions for astrophysics. Where do we come from and are we alone? [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11316.539999999999s)]
*  And we're looking forward to getting those results. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11322.22s)]
*  Is Webb going to work? [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11324.38s)]
*  Yes, it's going to work. I have very high confidence. [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11326.22s)]
*  I am 100 percent confident. [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11328.58s)]
*  Why 100 percent confident? [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11330.02s)]
*  Because when I look at the testing that we have done over the years and the type of engineering that went into it, you build a sense of confidence that you know it's going to work. [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11331.98s)]
*  What are you most concerned about? [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11342.300000000001s)]
*  Unfolding the entire telescope is what you worry about. [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11344.94s)]
*  The observatory had to be folded into an Ariane 5 rocket just 16 feet wide. It's wrapped today, tied as a rosebud. [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11347.7s)]
*  In flight, more than 40 systems must blossom with perfection, including Amy Lowe's never-invented-before sunshield. [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11357.900000000001s)]
*  All five layers will be folded up and held in place by pins. How many pins are there? [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11367.460000000001s)]
*  There's 107 of these membrane release devices and pins that hold all five layers pinned to this structure here called the UPS. All total 107. [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11374.54s)]
*  And as you're unfolding, how many of those can fail? [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11386.06s)]
*  None. [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11390.779999999999s)]
*  None? [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11391.779999999999s)]
*  None. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11392.3s)]
*  Not one? [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11392.619999999999s)]
*  Not one. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11393.26s)]
*  There is literally no room for error. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11393.74s)]
*  We test and we do a lot of analysis to ensure that each and every single one of these will release on orbit. [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11397.06s)]
*  Ten billion dollars rides on those pins. The Hubble telescope, 340 miles up, could be reached with a wrench. Webb, at a million miles, is beyond repair. [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11406.7s)]
*  Bill Oakes told us that if something does get stuck, there is an emergency plan. [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11419.86s)]
*  We've developed algorithms to essentially, we call it the shimmy, we do a little shake on the telescope and we can rock it back and forth. [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11425.42s)]
*  That doesn't work. We have another one we call the twirl, which can actually spin the telescope either clockwise or counterclockwise to help shake things loose. [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11432.660000000002s)]
*  So you're going to do what I do with devices when they're not working. You're going to shake it. [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11440.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Can I do the same thing? Yes. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11445.42s)]
*  If 107 pins release, the mirrors synchronize and 10,000 things go right, Webb will be limited only by about 10 years of fuel for pivoting and pointing. [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11448.220000000001s)]
*  Canada contributed the aiming system that will guide Webb to wonders far and near. More than a thousand astronomers around the world are competing for telescope time. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11461.02s)]
*  Heidi Hamill was granted 100 hours. [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11472.9s)]
*  I have so many questions. My particular focus is objects in our solar system. [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11476.380000000001s)]
*  Hamill told us that light is full of information. [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11484.78s)]
*  Webb can define the chemistry of a place by analyzing its wavelengths of light. [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11488.62s)]
*  What is the atmospheric water content of Mars? And how does it change with time? [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11495.02s)]
*  What drives the chemistry in the upper atmosphere of Neptune? [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11500.460000000001s)]
*  Can we see if there's water coming out of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn? [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11506.060000000001s)]
*  There are just an infinite number of questions I want to answer. [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11512.78s)]
*  Astrophysicist Natalie Batalia also has time on Webb. She'll be looking at planets beyond our solar system. [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11516.62s)]
*  On average, every star in the galaxy has at least one planet. That means that there are more planets in the galaxy than there are stars, hundreds of billions of planets. [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11525.02s)]
*  And with that many planets, Batalia is sure Webb could find some with the chemistry and conditions of life. [[03:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11536.62s)]
*  There happens to be one planetary system. The star has seven planets orbiting it. And the star is only about 40 light years away. [[03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11545.18s)]
*  So it's a great target to study. And it has three Earth-sized planets orbiting in what I would call the Goldilocks Zone, where life could potentially exist. [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11554.86s)]
*  Not too hot, not too cold. [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11566.14s)]
*  That's the idea, yes. And so this is also one of the very first targets that we're going to observe with Webb. [[03:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11567.74s)]
*  And what we'll be able to see is, is there carbon dioxide in the atmosphere? What are the greenhouse gases? [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11574.859999999999s)]
*  Is there carbon dioxide in combination with methane? Because that's what Earth has. [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11582.14s)]
*  So by looking at these chemical constituents, we might be able to piece together if it's not just a planet in what we call the habitable zone, [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11587.019999999999s)]
*  but if it's truly a habitable environment. [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11594.86s)]
*  And somebody might ask, why does it matter? [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11597.74s)]
*  The end point is to put an end to our cosmic loneliness. We want to know if there's life out there. [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11600.94s)]
*  From a researcher's perspective, is Webb evolutionary or revolutionary? [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11607.980000000001s)]
*  Every time you put a new piece of technology into space or you look at the universe with different eyes, [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11615.74s)]
*  you learn something revolutionary, something that you couldn't have even predicted. [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11623.74s)]
*  I don't know what those surprises are going to be, but the technology is revolutionary and there will be tremendous surprises that will astound us. [[03:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11628.7s)]
*  Webb is on the doorstep aboard a European space agency rocket. [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11637.42s)]
*  Some, including Amy Lowe, may hold their breath as it unfolds itself on the month-long journey to its station around the sun. [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11642.78s)]
*  The first images, in six months or so, will be converted from invisible infrared into pictures suitable for headlines. [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11651.9s)]
*  Chances are what we see, we will not understand the very definition of wonder. [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManRWAjgZhw&t=11661.34s)]
