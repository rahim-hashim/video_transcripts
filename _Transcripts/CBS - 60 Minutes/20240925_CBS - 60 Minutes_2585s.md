*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=104.84s)]
*  We are in the midst of the worst drug crisis in U.S. history. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=110.6s)]
*  The drug is fentanyl. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  And unlike cocaine and heroin, it's a purely chemical man-made drug. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=122.0s)]
*  It's cheap to produce, easily smuggled, and packs an incredibly addictive punch, 50 times [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=127.0s)]
*  more powerful than heroin. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=132.68s)]
*  Nearly all the fentanyl flooding into the U.S. is made in Mexico by two powerful drug [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=135.0s)]
*  cartels with chemicals primarily purchased from China. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=140.8s)]
*  And as you're about to hear, it is frequently hidden in counterfeit pills made to look just [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  like prescription drugs. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=150.84s)]
*  It's the scourge of our time. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=152.96s)]
*  Last year, more than 70,000 Americans died from fentanyl. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=155.36s)]
*  That's a higher death toll than U.S. military casualties in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=159.72s)]
*  combined. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=166.0s)]
*  We were so naive to fentanyl. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=168.52s)]
*  We thought fentanyl, you hear about it, but you think, oh, that's just affecting people [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=171.2s)]
*  on the streets, homeless people, drug addicts. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=175.24s)]
*  No. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=178.12s)]
*  It is so insidious. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=179.12s)]
*  Angela King and Mike O'Kelly lost their 20-year-old son Jack to fentanyl last Thanksgiving. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=180.6s)]
*  A junior at the University of Georgia, Jack had come home for the long weekend and was [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  out late partying. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=192.92s)]
*  He was at a friend's house, so I had gone to bed, a little worried. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  The next morning, he couldn't reach Jack, so he used Find My iPhone. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=200.0s)]
*  When I could see where he was, I texted the mother of the house, who basically sent me [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=205.32s)]
*  a message back, oh, we're not there, door's unlocked, they're asleep. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  At 11 o'clock Thanksgiving morning, Mike went upstairs and found his son in bed, unresponsive. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=216.44s)]
*  I noticed his chest wasn't moving, so I immediately pulled him out of the bed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=223.72s)]
*  I had performed CPR for 30-plus minutes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=229.16s)]
*  They called me and screaming in the phone, Jack's gone, Jack's gone. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=240.28s)]
*  I immediately rushed over there with one of our children. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=252.2s)]
*  The EMT had arrived and was working on Jack upstairs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=259.12s)]
*  It was the most horrific, traumatic, there's not words. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=264.72s)]
*  Jack O'Kelly was captain of his high school football and the cross teams. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  He was studying business at Georgia and was a popular member of his fraternity. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=278.0s)]
*  Have you been able to piece together? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=282.72s)]
*  Why take a pill? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=286.56s)]
*  Was this his first time? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=288.44000000000005s)]
*  I think he was just out having a good time and made a stupid mistake. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, the experimental days of taking drugs in college are over. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=298.68s)]
*  All the pills are laced with fentanyl. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=305.24s)]
*  Mike and Angela found text messages between Jack and a drug dealer. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  He bought what he thought was Xanax, oxycodone and a gram of cocaine, but the death certificate [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=311.38s)]
*  states fentanyl was the cause of death. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  He wasn't seeking fentanyl. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=320.6s)]
*  He made a really bad decision, not one that should have taken his life though. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=322.0s)]
*  Sounds like you've had a crash course in learning about fentanyl. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=331.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=332.88s)]
*  Which is shocking to me because at the rate that fentanyl is killing people in this country, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=333.88s)]
*  it is absolutely ludicrous that this is not on the front page of every newspaper and every [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=340.12s)]
*  news broadcast daily. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, a chemical cousin to morphine, originally designed for [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=350.12s)]
*  hospital patients in extreme pain. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=355.12s)]
*  Now it is in cities and towns in all 50 states. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=358.24s)]
*  Frequent users heat up fentanyl powder and inhale it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=362.68s)]
*  But more often, it's sold in pill form, deliberately made to look like real prescription drugs. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=366.44s)]
*  The one on the left contains fentanyl. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=373.20000000000005s)]
*  It's two milligrams, an amount that fits on the tip of a pencil can kill. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=376.64s)]
*  The cartels don't sell fentanyl as fentanyl. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=381.64s)]
*  They hide it in other drugs like cocaine or methamphetamine or heroin. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  They make it into these fake pills that look identical to pharmaceutical drugs that Americans [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=390.2s)]
*  would recognize like oxy or Xanax, Percocet, Adderall. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=395.71999999999997s)]
*  It will be a very massive high that is very short. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=400.46s)]
*  And that person, they're betting if they survive, will come back again and again and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=404.48s)]
*  again to buy more. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=409.68s)]
*  Three years ago, Anne Milgram, a former attorney general of New Jersey, took over the Drug [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=411.48s)]
*  Enforcement Administration. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=416.88s)]
*  Since then, fentanyl has claimed more than 200,000 American lives, although deaths appear [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=419.04s)]
*  to be leveling off. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=425.08000000000004s)]
*  Fentanyl is impacting every part of the United States. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=427.12s)]
*  It's impacting our communities. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=429.8s)]
*  It's impacting our kids. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=431.62s)]
*  It's impacting our economy. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=433.2s)]
*  One of the things that I've learned over the last few years that really stays with me is [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=435.28s)]
*  every single week we lose 22 teens between the ages of 14 and 18. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=439.68s)]
*  Every week. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=444.92s)]
*  Every single week, we're basically losing a high school class somewhere in America. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=445.92s)]
*  She started putting pictures of people who died from fentanyl in the lobby of DEA headquarters, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  a daily reminder of the drug's catastrophic impact. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  We're losing a generation. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=460.2s)]
*  That's what this is. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=461.96s)]
*  You can see it so clearly when you look and you see Americans from all walks of life, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  all states, all communities, young and old, every background possible. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=468.76s)]
*  We have folks in military uniforms. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=473.28s)]
*  We've got babies. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  You can see. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  Someone who just picks up a pill that a parent dropped. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  The DEA is part of the Department of Justice and conducts intelligence gathering and counter [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  drug operations worldwide. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  Milgram oversees 10,000 employees. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=490.28000000000003s)]
*  As complex and as massive a problem as this is, it's also not a whodunit. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=493.16s)]
*  We know who's responsible. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=498.24s)]
*  It's the Sinaloa cartel and the Jalisco cartel that are based in Mexico. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=499.88s)]
*  They dominate and control the entire global fentanyl supply chain, starting in China, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=504.0s)]
*  going to Mexico, coming into the United States. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=509.08s)]
*  Milgram told us this crisis began 10 years ago when the cartels started to wrestle control [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=511.6s)]
*  of the supply chain from China and began making fentanyl in clandestine labs in Mexico. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=517.68s)]
*  So these two drug cartels from our neighbor, from Mexico, are responsible for almost 70,000 [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=524.76s)]
*  American deaths a year? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=533.9599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  How do you fight that? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=536.4399999999999s)]
*  We've taken action over the last three years against every single part of that global supply [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  charging Chinese nationals with selling fentanyl precursors, charging and indicting, investigating [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=542.92s)]
*  members of these cartels at every level. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=549.68s)]
*  And then finally taking hundreds of millions of deadly doses of fentanyl off American streets. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=552.4399999999999s)]
*  And we're making progress, but there's so much more that needs to be done. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=558.4s)]
*  The majority of the fentanyl that we're seeing, about 90 plus percent is coming in passenger [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=562.04s)]
*  vehicles. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=568.0s)]
*  Commissioner Troy Miller, a 30 year veteran of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=569.24s)]
*  us almost all the fentanyl coming into the country is smuggled through legal ports of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=574.0s)]
*  entry like here at San Ysidro, between San Diego and Tijuana. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=579.32s)]
*  It's the busiest land port in the Western Hemisphere. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=584.2s)]
*  What percentage of the smuggled fentanyl do you think you are catching? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=587.96s)]
*  You know, Bill, I don't know what percentage we're catching, but I can tell you we've seized [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=592.6s)]
*  27,000 pounds of fentanyl in fiscal year 2023. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=598.48s)]
*  Miller took us for a bird's eye view to see the magnitude of the challenge. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=604.6s)]
*  So this is the wall, comes right up to the port of entry and it resumes here. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=609.76s)]
*  That's Mexico. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=613.76s)]
*  More than 60,000 cars snaked through 34 lanes, 24-7. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=615.88s)]
*  Officers have a minute or less to decide who gets a second look and they only have the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=623.12s)]
*  resources to search 8 percent of the cars. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=627.84s)]
*  Dogs trained to sniff out fentanyl are some of their best assets. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=631.2800000000001s)]
*  The cartels are constantly adapting, for example, hiding pills in gas tanks to mask the scent. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=636.4000000000001s)]
*  So we're in the seizure vault. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=643.2800000000001s)]
*  Commissioner Miller showed us rack after rack of seized drugs locked in this massive vault. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=645.0s)]
*  For security reasons, we agreed not to divulge its location. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=651.48s)]
*  So explain to me why the smugglers would use the busiest port as their main smuggling route. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, it seems counterintuitive. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=663.64s)]
*  Why not do it someplace much less conspicuous? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=665.48s)]
*  Why not come across the desert? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=668.36s)]
*  Well, in the San Diego field office, we're seeing 200,000 people a day. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=669.9200000000001s)]
*  Every one of these 200,000 people is presenting themselves as a legitimate traveler. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=676.44s)]
*  We were astonished to learn two-thirds of the people arrested smuggling fentanyl are [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=682.44s)]
*  American citizens paid by the cartels. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=687.96s)]
*  We've seen terrible trends. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=691.7600000000001s)]
*  We've seen high school, middle schoolers smuggling fentanyl and dropping it off to a cartel member [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=693.24s)]
*  at a high school. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=701.0s)]
*  Do you have the budget and the manpower you need? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=702.0s)]
*  I've been very clear that Customs and Border Protection needs more officers. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=706.48s)]
*  We need more agents. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=711.56s)]
*  We need more Intel research specialists to distill that information. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=712.8s)]
*  We asked him about the bipartisan border bill killed by the Senate at the urging of former [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=717.4s)]
*  President Donald Trump. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=722.88s)]
*  It would have provided 1,500 new border and customs officers and 100 high-tech detection [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=724.72s)]
*  machines. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=731.32s)]
*  The bill had money for much of the stuff you were talking about is the political inaction. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  Is that costing lives? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=738.5600000000001s)]
*  Again, what I can say is we need more resources to do our jobs and we need to all get on the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=740.88s)]
*  same page and tackle this together. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=745.8000000000001s)]
*  Sherry Hobson saw the fentanyl crisis coming. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=748.6s)]
*  As an assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego, she prosecuted Mexican cartel cases for 30 [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=752.24s)]
*  years before retiring in 2020. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=758.76s)]
*  Cartels are very business-oriented. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=762.36s)]
*  They look for profit. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=764.6800000000001s)]
*  They look for perpetual power. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=766.36s)]
*  They're institutionalized. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=768.5200000000001s)]
*  It sounds like you're saying they're very sophisticated. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=769.5200000000001s)]
*  They are. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=772.24s)]
*  They do their homework. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=773.24s)]
*  They do their analysis. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=774.24s)]
*  She says the cartels move into fentanyl was entirely predictable. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=775.32s)]
*  When the U.S. opioid crisis triggered a crackdown on the drug industry and many companies were [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=780.2s)]
*  sued by ravaged communities, the supply of legal opioids dried up. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=785.4000000000001s)]
*  But the demand from Americans addicted to the drugs did not. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=790.88s)]
*  It's very strange to think that the pharmaceutical industry basically set the table for the Mexican [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=795.36s)]
*  cartels to come in and dominate. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=801.88s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=804.6s)]
*  It is. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=805.6s)]
*  So I think what happened was they said, you know what? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=806.6s)]
*  We have an open market. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=808.36s)]
*  We have millions of people that are addicted to oxycodone. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=810.02s)]
*  We can do fentanyl. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=813.22s)]
*  We can create these counterfeit pills and we can sell them. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=815.02s)]
*  So the Mexican cartels just filled this vacuum. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=818.96s)]
*  Filled the void, filled the vacuum. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=823.5799999999999s)]
*  So the opioid epidemic definitely started this arc that we're on. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=825.42s)]
*  The head of the DEA, Anne Milgram, agrees the U.S. drug industry bears a lot of blame [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=829.34s)]
*  crisis, but says social media companies are fueling it today. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=835.9799999999999s)]
*  The companies say they're taking steps to combat this. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=841.14s)]
*  And what's happening on social media, the cartels use it to organize themselves, to [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=844.5799999999999s)]
*  get individuals who will carry the drugs across the border from Mexico to post ads for drugs [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=849.5s)]
*  and to sell drugs, whether it's Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=855.6199999999999s)]
*  There are drugs being sold there every single day. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=860.66s)]
*  And seven out of ten of those counterfeit pills the DEA tests have a potentially deadly [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=863.62s)]
*  dose of fentanyl. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=869.22s)]
*  Angela King and Mike O'Kelly say that's information every American needs to know. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=870.98s)]
*  It's a war. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=877.46s)]
*  It's a new drug war. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=878.54s)]
*  And that drug war is totally different than anything we've ever dealt with before, because [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=880.64s)]
*  now we're losing our young ones. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=885.18s)]
*  And whatever the government's trying to do, I'm glad they're doing something. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=887.46s)]
*  It just doesn't seem to be enough. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=891.1s)]
*  How do you reverse a fentanyl overdose? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=898.1s)]
*  Even if someone were able to get Narcan, just one or two doses might not be enough. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=901.4200000000001s)]
*  At 60MinutesOvertime.com. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=905.9s)]
*  Everywhere you go, people are complaining about inflation. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=913.38s)]

*  She says much of the blame for the exorbitant prices on everything from food to concert [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=928.74s)]
*  tickets is widespread corporate consolidation. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=933.86s)]
*  The FTC's mission is breaking illegal monopolies, blocking mergers that stifle competition, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=938.46s)]

*  But she's so aggressive that she's feared and loathed in boardrooms seen as a zealot [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=951.3399999999999s)]

*  the perils of business monopolies. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=976.26s)]

*  And what that means is companies can start ripping you off, hiking prices, stealing [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=984.26s)]

*  Kahn says this merger risks raising food prices even higher than they are now. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1031.1399999999999s)]
*  Grocery prices have gone through the roof. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1036.62s)]
*  I believe that you think it's because of monopolies. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1039.54s)]
*  But most economists say that it's because of supply chains caused by COVID and the Ukraine [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1043.58s)]
*  War. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1049.58s)]
*  So which is it? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1050.58s)]
*  There's no doubt that the pandemic and the war led prices to soar. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1051.62s)]
*  What's been interesting is that even as some of those supply chain pressures have eased, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1057.26s)]
*  prices have not come down concurrently as much. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1062.06s)]
*  So instead of inflation, are you contending that it's greedflation, that these monopolies [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1065.06s)]
*  are deliberately hiking the prices? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1071.74s)]
*  So there's a lot of discussion about what's driving the inflation. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1073.9399999999998s)]
*  And we've actually seen some executives boast on earnings calls about how inflation is great [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1078.58s)]
*  for their bottom line. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1084.82s)]
*  They say that. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1086.3s)]
*  They have said that publicly, yes. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1087.3s)]
*  What about the argument that when companies merge, prices often come down because of efficiencies, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1089.46s)]
*  scale? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1096.86s)]
*  But even if those efficiencies arise, if the company is not checked by competition, it [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1097.86s)]
*  won't have an incentive to pass those benefits on to the consumer because those consumers [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1103.82s)]
*  may not have anywhere else to go. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1108.46s)]
*  Another consumer concern, the high cost of medicine. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1111.7s)]
*  Khan talks to independent pharmacists about the tricks and traps she says Big Pharma uses [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1116.46s)]
*  to jack up prices. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1122.58s)]
*  For example, she zeroed in on the makers of asthma inhalers for extending their patents [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1124.8600000000001s)]
*  to keep low-cost generics off the shelves. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1130.54s)]
*  On these inhalers, they cost $7 in France. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1133.78s)]
*  The same exact inhaler is around $500 in the United States. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1139.3000000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1144.74s)]
*  Now, something's out of whack. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1145.74s)]
*  We agree. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1147.14s)]
*  So we took a close look at this and we found that companies were listing patents for things [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1148.14s)]
*  like the inhaler cap or the strap on your inhaler. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1153.9s)]
*  So nothing to do with the actual ingredients of the drug or the formulation or composition [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1158.66s)]
*  of the drug. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1164.1000000000001s)]
*  So this is an inhaler for asthma. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1165.42s)]
*  Tell us what the innovation was that they claimed allowed them to extend the patent. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1168.1s)]
*  So it's this strap that they listed a patent for, this little piece of plastic. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1173.14s)]
*  No. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1178.74s)]
*  They were saying that they should be able to continue the patent, generics can't come [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1180.1s)]
*  in for the medication because they put that strap on. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1185.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1189.18s)]
*  To make sure you didn't lose the cap. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1190.18s)]
*  That's right. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1191.7s)]
*  After the FTC sent warning letters to the four major inhaler makers, three of them, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1192.7s)]
*  including this one, dropped the price from hundreds of dollars to just $35. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1198.54s)]
*  And two days ago, the FTC filed a lawsuit to bring down the price of insulin and scores [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1204.98s)]
*  of other drugs. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1211.18s)]
*  Suing three companies, the agency says are responsible for manipulating most of the prices. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1212.54s)]
*  These really fundamental things about people's daily material lives are affected by things [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1218.94s)]
*  like antitrust. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1223.6200000000001s)]
*  But investment bankers, venture capitalists and top CEOs say she's biased against them, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1225.06s)]
*  that Lena Kahn picks on winners because they're winners and thinks big is always bad. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1232.56s)]
*  Actually, Kahn's doggedness represents a shift in policy, a mandate to reverse decades of [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1239.5s)]
*  a hands-off strategy toward mergers and acquisitions. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1246.66s)]
*  It was introduced by Ronald Reagan and adopted by all presidents since, including Clinton [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1250.1000000000001s)]
*  and Obama, until President Biden put an end to it. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1256.6200000000001s)]
*  We are now 40 years into the experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1261.3400000000001s)]
*  and more power. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1265.9s)]
*  And where have we gotten from it? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1266.9s)]
*  Less growth, weakened investment, fewer small businesses. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1270.6200000000001s)]
*  After President Biden, the FTC and the Justice Department have unleashed a crackdown, suing [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1275.1s)]
*  scores of companies including Ticketmaster, NVIDIA and the Big Five, Amazon, Metta, Microsoft, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1281.58s)]
*  Apple and a court just deemed Google an illegal monopoly. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1290.3799999999999s)]
*  It's a revolution. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1295.8999999999999s)]
*  And the face of it is Lena Kahn. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1297.82s)]
*  We're all law students and we love you. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1300.5s)]
*  Can we have a selfie? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1302.1399999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1303.1399999999999s)]
*  One, two, one. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1304.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1305.18s)]
*  When Kahn was a student here at Yale Law School, she wrote a paper called Amazon's Antitrust [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1306.18s)]
*  Paradox, contending that even though Amazon's prices are low, it's still a monopoly. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1312.46s)]
*  This was seen as an extraordinary breakthrough and it went viral. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1319.5200000000002s)]
*  Less than five years later, President Biden made her head of the agency that polices Amazon. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1324.46s)]
*  You know, Amazon is a very popular company. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1331.3s)]
*  People like the convenience, the choice. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1334.66s)]
*  The prices are pretty moderate and they're afraid that you're going to tamper with something [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1336.82s)]
*  that's good that they like. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1341.34s)]
*  Our investigation uncovered that Amazon's illegal practices were actually raising prices [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1343.26s)]
*  for consumers because it had illegally muscled out rivals, locked them out of the market [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1348.54s)]
*  in ways that if you had more competition that Amazon hadn't squashed, consumers would be [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1354.8600000000001s)]
*  even better off. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1359.44s)]
*  Amazon denies doing anything illegal and says if Kahn wins, prices will go up. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1361.02s)]
*  Also in the FTC's crosshairs, the issue of tech giants buying up smaller companies. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1368.7s)]
*  In the technology markets, we went through a couple of decades where we saw over 800 [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1375.54s)]
*  acquisitions by the five big players, not a single one of which was blocked. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1380.74s)]
*  And some of those, we realized, ended up leading to significant harm. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1385.78s)]
*  Just to give you a concrete example, there were companies that were offering Americans [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1390.06s)]
*  greater privacy and they were promising that we're not going to use your data, we're not [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1394.84s)]
*  going to sell it, we're not going to spy on you everywhere all the time. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1399.52s)]
*  After some of those firms were bought up by one of the big guys, all of those data privacy [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1403.96s)]
*  policies changed overnight. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1409.1399999999999s)]
*  And so Americans lost those privacy protections. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1411.3s)]
*  You're talking about Facebook and WhatsApp. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1414.0s)]
*  Yes, that's one example of that. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1416.2s)]
*  He's now suing over Facebook's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1418.32s)]
*  Is the mandate to reverse what's gone on for 40 years, to undo some of the mergers that [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1424.24s)]
*  were approved? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1430.96s)]
*  We've identified not just one merger, but a whole string of mergers that some of these [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1432.2s)]
*  large companies made that we believe were illegal, that we believe were anti-competitive. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1436.8799999999999s)]
*  But they were approved. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1441.6399999999999s)]
*  They were not blocked. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1443.48s)]
*  They were not challenged. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1445.5s)]
*  But the courts don't always side with her. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1447.18s)]
*  The FTC has lost a couple of big cases against Meta and Microsoft. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1449.74s)]
*  Yet her cage-rattling has had a chilling effect, where companies simply drop their merger plans. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1455.78s)]
*  Sometimes the companies decide that they're going to abandon the merger. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1462.8200000000002s)]
*  Someone just says, I'm not going to go forward. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1467.28s)]
*  That's a win. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1469.64s)]
*  That's right. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1470.64s)]
*  Obviously the companies are complaining like hell, screaming, and they don't like you. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1471.64s)]
*  They're afraid of you. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1476.8s)]
*  Well look, we're doing our job, enforcing the law. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1478.78s)]
*  They are. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1481.62s)]
*  They're afraid you're going to tie them up in court, you're going to cost them a lot [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1482.62s)]
*  of money, and they're saying it's just not worth it. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1486.98s)]
*  So it's important to step back and keep all of this in context. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1490.3s)]
*  Of all the thousands of deals that are proposed every year, the FTC and DOJ collectively investigate [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1494.3s)]
*  maybe 2 or 3 percent. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1501.54s)]
*  That might not sound like a lot, but startup founders complain that she's spooking investors [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1504.26s)]
*  so much, she's actually stifling innovation. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1510.24s)]
*  Others fear that her chasing the tech giants will cause a domino effect. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1515.36s)]
*  Earlier this month, after it was reported that her counterpart at the Justice Department [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1520.52s)]
*  subpoenaed the chipmaker Nvidia, the stock market plunged. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1525.56s)]
*  Do you ever worry about the power that the FTC and the chairman have that could result [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1533.28s)]
*  in a destabilizing of basically the whole economy? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1541.36s)]
*  Of course we have to worry, but we also should worry about the destabilizing effect that [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1546.74s)]
*  can arise from companies believing that they're above the law and then they can be reckless, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1551.3999999999999s)]
*  take massive risks in ways that can crash the economy, and then they can get away with [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1556.42s)]
*  just a slap on the wrist and that creates a destabilization too. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1560.84s)]
*  Khan can be seen as a belated reaction to the financial crisis when the government decided [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1564.9599999999998s)]
*  banks were too big to fail. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1570.5s)]
*  But has the pendulum swung too far? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1573.6s)]
*  Corporations are pushing back with their own lawsuits to rein her in, setting up a possible [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1577.34s)]
*  showdown at the Supreme Court over the fate of the FTC. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1582.34s)]
*  Would you be concerned that you are flirting with diminishing the powers that you have [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1587.62s)]
*  if the court decides you're wrong? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1594.3799999999999s)]
*  And this court could very likely say you're wrong. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1597.0s)]
*  I think one challenge that agencies can face is when they shrink their own powers and authorities [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1602.0s)]
*  by not actually using the authorities that Congress has given them. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1608.3799999999999s)]
*  She's obviously unlikely to survive in her job if former President Trump wins, though [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1612.9s)]
*  she's admired by vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1618.94s)]
*  Well, look, I don't agree with Lena Cullen on every issue to be clear, but I think that [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1622.8600000000001s)]
*  she's been very smart about trying to go after some of these big tech companies. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1625.8200000000002s)]
*  She's surprisingly popular with other MAGA Republicans. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1629.5s)]

*  Conservatives. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1641.26s)]

*  It's important in these jobs to really stay focused and block out a lot of the noise. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1669.78s)]
*  If you were asked to keep this job, would you say yes? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1674.18s)]
*  Obviously, those are conversations one has with one's family and that sort of thing. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1679.7s)]
*  You don't want to have it with me? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1684.18s)]
*  But absolutely. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1687.02s)]
*  I mean, there's so much work to be done and it's such an honor to be in this role and [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1688.02s)]
*  it would be an honor to have that opportunity to keep going. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1691.54s)]
*  The National Archives has been in the news lately, not so much for what is in its collection, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1699.54s)]

*  and built to be a temple to history. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1776.4s)]
*  Each year, more than a million people make the trip to see these national treasures in [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1780.68s)]
*  person. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1785.48s)]
*  This building, the Rotunda, was built as a shrine for many of these documents, but they [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1786.48s)]
*  didn't arrive until later. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1790.8s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1792.8400000000001s)]
*  The building was completed in 1937, but the Declaration and the Constitution did not arrive [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1793.8400000000001s)]
*  until 1952. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1798.76s)]
*  They were in the possession of the Library of Congress, which refused to turn them over [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1800.72s)]
*  until President Truman got involved and they were delivered from Capitol Hill by the U.S. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1806.08s)]
*  military. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1811.1599999999999s)]
*  They will be protected from disaster and from the ravages of time. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1812.1599999999999s)]
*  Ah, the Declaration of Independence. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1817.6799999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1821.08s)]
*  Why is it so faded? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1822.08s)]
*  It was exposed to considerable light in the elements. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1823.8799999999999s)]
*  In the 19th century, the U.S. Patent Office put the Declaration on display near a window. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1827.04s)]
*  That and other missteps did so much damage, nearly all you can make out today is John [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1833.54s)]
*  Hancock's John Hancock. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1839.54s)]
*  To preserve them, these original documents that are a beacon for democracy are now intentionally [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1842.8999999999999s)]
*  kept in the dark. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1848.26s)]
*  They are guarded around the clock, in bulletproof cases designed to remain sealed for 100 years. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1849.86s)]
*  All federal employees are required to take an oath to defend the Constitution. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1861.22s)]
*  But for Colleen Shogan, it's literally her job. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1866.18s)]
*  And the founding documents are just the start. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1870.14s)]
*  We have approximately 13.5 billion paper records here at the National Archives. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1873.38s)]
*  How many feet of film? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1880.32s)]
*  Oh, the film would go around the globe three and a half times. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1881.32s)]
*  How many photographs? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1886.58s)]
*  We have millions and millions of photographs as well. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1888.7s)]
*  And how many artifacts? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1892.3400000000001s)]
*  Over 700,000 artifacts. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1893.82s)]
*  Most of that massive collection is kept outside of Washington, stored at dozens of facilities [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1899.7s)]
*  all across the country that span millions of cubic feet, including four underground [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1905.74s)]
*  cave complexes in the Midwest. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1911.74s)]
*  For our civilian record center in Valmeyer, Illinois, our archivists actually use bikes [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1914.54s)]
*  because it's about a mile from one end of the facility to the other. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1919.74s)]
*  Then there's the stuff they don't even keep. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1925.06s)]
*  Only about 3% of government paperwork is deemed important enough to preserve for posterity. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1927.6599999999999s)]
*  Documents can sit for years before being retained or more likely destroyed. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1934.22s)]
*  At the Washington National Records Center outside D.C., there are 20 football fields [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1939.58s)]
*  of files stacked floor to ceiling, awaiting their fate. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1945.22s)]
*  Until 1934, federal agencies stored their own records with varying degrees of success. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1950.38s)]
*  When the archives was created, work began to restore 158 years' worth of dusty, forgotten [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1957.68s)]
*  documents. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1964.62s)]
*  To see how some of America's oldest paper records have held up, we met Trevor Plant, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1966.62s)]
*  who's in charge of more than two billion written documents in Washington. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1972.7399999999998s)]
*  So this is original from 1778? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1977.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1979.62s)]
*  During the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress wanted George Washington and his [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1980.62s)]
*  officers to pledge allegiance in writing to their new nation after they survived a brutal [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1985.9799999999998s)]
*  winter at Valley Forge. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1991.5s)]
*  So the irony is that the Army can barely afford to feed them, clothe them, house them, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1993.7s)]
*  supply them with arms and ammunition, but they're like, here's all this paperwork. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=1998.5800000000002s)]
*  We want it filled out and returned. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2001.46s)]
*  And so that is George Washington's handwriting and signature? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2003.38s)]
*  Correct, yep. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2006.5s)]
*  And then here? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2008.26s)]
*  This officer became very popular a couple years ago, Alexander Hamilton. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2009.6200000000001s)]
*  We don't often think of him as Alex Hamilton, but he signed his name Alex Hamilton on his oath. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2013.38s)]
*  Trevor Plant has a theory about why one of his favorite documents looks so unique. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2019.18s)]
*  This is a resolution passed by Congress in early 1865. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2026.1000000000001s)]
*  Once it was ratified, it became the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2031.6200000000001s)]
*  And if you notice on here, there's several different handwritings for the 13th Amendment. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2035.8200000000002s)]
*  So we speculate that these clerks realized what a big deal this was at the time and literally [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2041.98s)]
*  wanted to have a hand in history. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2046.7s)]
*  Because the 13th Amendment abolished slavery? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2048.7400000000002s)]
*  Abolished slavery in the United States, exactly. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2050.54s)]
*  Plant likes to say archives keeps the nation's receipts, and he means it, like the treaty [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2053.02s)]
*  for the Louisiana Purchase. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2059.38s)]
*  It was four cents an acre, which was a pretty good deal since we doubled the size of the [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2060.94s)]
*  United States. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2065.94s)]
*  Signed by Napoleon Bonaparte himself. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2067.58s)]
*  There's also the Deed of Gift that came with the Statue of Liberty from France in 1884. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2070.82s)]
*  Two years later it will be installed in New York Harbor. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2077.46s)]
*  And the check Russia cashed when the U.S. bought Alaska in 1867 for $7.2 million. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2080.7000000000003s)]
*  Came back to the government as a canceled check. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2088.6200000000003s)]
*  In 1988, after Archives' main building in Washington ran out of room, Congress funded [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2091.7400000000002s)]
*  the construction of a state-of-the-art facility in College Park, Maryland. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2097.22s)]
*  From there, Deputy Archivist Jay Bosenko runs day-to-day operations. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2101.9399999999996s)]
*  He invited us into their most restricted vault, where cameras usually aren't allowed, to see [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2108.54s)]
*  relics of a dark chapter in world history. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2114.58s)]
*  Hitler's last will and testament and Ava Braun's diary. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2118.74s)]
*  This happens to be from 1935. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2123.2599999999998s)]
*  How's it that the U.S. government got its hands on Hitler's mistress's diary? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2126.5s)]
*  So this was quite literally sort of the spoils of war. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2131.1s)]
*  This was captured by U.S. armed forces, then transferred to us at the National Archives. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2134.66s)]
*  Some of the items inside this vault only became historically significant with age, like this [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2140.92s)]
*  letter from a young Fidel Castro to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2147.18s)]
*  So there may be treasures like this buried in boxes in lots of places. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2153.0s)]
*  Yet to be discovered. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2157.6s)]
*  You never know when you're opening a box what you might find next. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2159.0s)]
*  Or who might be opening it. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2163.28s)]
*  Researchers, writers and history buffs from around the country and the world come to the [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2165.48s)]
*  Archives to make discoveries. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2170.92s)]
*  We saw a group from Japan cataloging the American occupation that followed World War II. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2173.36s)]
*  And a U.S. Army unit on a special mission, combing through a million old Army files looking [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2180.62s)]
*  for black and Native American soldiers who were once overlooked but might now be awarded [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2186.58s)]
*  the Medal of Honor. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2192.8399999999997s)]
*  The records that we hold need to be made available. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2194.6s)]
*  We need to bring the stories that are captured in those records alive. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2198.2999999999997s)]
*  There's a record here at College Park that I want to show you and our viewers. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2202.88s)]
*  This is the resignation letter of Richard Nixon, August 9, 1974. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2208.72s)]
*  This is an incredibly important document. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2216.8799999999997s)]
*  I had no prior knowledge of the Watergate break-in. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2219.72s)]
*  Before the Watergate scandal, records belonged to the presidents who created them. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2224.04s)]
*  But after President Nixon sought to destroy audio tapes with evidence of potential crimes, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2229.62s)]
*  Congress took action. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2235.7999999999997s)]
*  When an individual controls the records, they control the story. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2237.68s)]
*  They control what the American people can know or not know about their presidency. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2244.12s)]
*  When did individual presidents stop owning the records that they created? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2250.8799999999997s)]
*  Not until 1978 when the Presidential Records Act was signed. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2257.02s)]
*  It's starting with President Reagan. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2261.52s)]
*  Now the records of a presidency belong to the American people and not to the president. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2264.04s)]
*  In 2021, former President Trump tested that law when he took dozens of boxes, including [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2269.72s)]
*  almost 340 documents bearing classification markings to his home in Florida. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2275.88s)]
*  Mr. Trump was eventually charged with 40 felonies, including for allegedly refusing to turn over [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2282.4s)]
*  some of the papers. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2288.56s)]
*  The case was dismissed, but the Justice Department is appealing. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2290.68s)]
*  President Joe Biden was also investigated over more than 80 documents with classification [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2295.24s)]
*  markings that he had from when he was vice president and a senator. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2300.24s)]
*  Mr. Biden cooperated with the investigation and was not charged. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2305.3599999999997s)]
*  Jay Bosenko told us, the archives is simply the custodian of the documents all presidents [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2310.16s)]
*  are required to turn over. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2315.74s)]
*  Enforcing the law is up to the Justice Department. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2317.92s)]
*  What is potentially lost when presidential records are not transferred to the National Archives? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2321.56s)]
*  That strikes at the very heart of the historical record, the completeness of it, the ability [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2327.2000000000003s)]
*  to understand decisions. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2333.52s)]
*  And so it's important for historians and ultimately the American people to understand [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2336.2000000000003s)]
*  all of the pieces that came in and made up that decision-making. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2341.36s)]
*  Those pieces of history start to become available to reporters and scholars five years after [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2345.4s)]
*  a presidency ends, at the 15 presidential libraries in the archives system. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2351.2000000000003s)]
*  When that five-year window hits, almost immediately we have a backlog of thousands of FOIA requests [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2357.88s)]
*  that we can't possibly respond to within the 10 days under the Free Reinformation Act. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2363.96s)]
*  When Colleen Shogan became archivist last year, she inherited a flat budget and a mountain [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2370.72s)]
*  of Freedom of Information Act requests. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2376.52s)]
*  At the George W. Bush Presidential Library, for example, a FOIA request might come back [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2379.64s)]
*  with a 12-year wait. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2384.64s)]
*  That's because of the extreme interest in those records. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2388.7999999999997s)]
*  And I think the way that we are going to make headway on this in the near future is going [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2393.3999999999996s)]
*  to be through technology. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2397.68s)]
*  The Archives' goal to scan and digitize all 13.5 billion paper records in its collection [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2399.92s)]
*  seems ambitious. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2406.04s)]
*  Only 2 percent of their holdings are currently available online. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2408.08s)]
*  We obtained a recent memo drafted by senior leaders at the agency who are concerned limited [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2412.2400000000002s)]
*  resources have put it at serious risk of mission failure. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2417.78s)]
*  Is it even possible to bring the Archives into the 21st century before the start of [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2425.04s)]
*  the 22nd century without some significant increase of resources? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2431.84s)]
*  I think we can do it. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2436.8s)]
*  We will do it. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2437.8s)]
*  We're going to have to reprioritize. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2438.8s)]
*  We're going to have to look at our budget. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2439.8s)]
*  But we will rely upon our institutions, upon Congress, and of course upon the executive [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2442.2799999999997s)]
*  branch to support us along the way. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2447.66s)]
*  While the Archives' path to digital transformation will be a work in progress for decades, a [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2451.84s)]
*  big change is coming soon to the Rotunda. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2458.48s)]
*  In 2026, the Emancipation Proclamation and the 19th Amendment, extending the right of [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2461.52s)]
*  suffrage to women, will be put on permanent display. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2468.3s)]
*  They are the first major additions to the Rotunda in 72 years. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2474.48s)]
*  It was the Archivist's decision. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2479.2200000000003s)]
*  She says it's not just to honor the nation's past, but a reminder that America's next [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2481.3999999999996s)]
*  chapter is not yet written. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2487.64s)]
*  The Last Minute of 60 Minutes is sponsored by UnitedHealthcare, reliable coverage for [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2498.64s)]
*  your whole life ahead. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2504.7599999999998s)]
*  Audio, the writing and recording of these words you're hearing now, has always been [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2508.68s)]
*  central to what we do each week on 60 Minutes. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2513.72s)]
*  In the words of Don Hewitt, the creator of this broadcast, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2517.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it's your ear more than your eye that keeps you on the television set. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2521.16s)]
*  It's with that in mind that we have created a new podcast, 60 Minutes, a Second Look. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2525.0s)]
*  CBS News' Seth Doan and team have spent the better part of a year mining the 60 Minutes [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2530.72s)]
*  Archive. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2536.3599999999997s)]
*  You'll hear from a 21-year-old Taylor Swift. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2537.52s)]
*  Sometimes I get really overwhelmed when I think about, like, 10 years from now I'll [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2541.36s)]
*  be 30. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2545.6s)]
*  And Secret Service agent Clint Hill opening up for the first time about the day President [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2547.44s)]
*  Kennedy was assassinated. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2552.6s)]
*  If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2555.08s)]
*  Search for 60 Minutes, a Second Look wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_pbsXS_WM&t=2561.1200000000003s)]
