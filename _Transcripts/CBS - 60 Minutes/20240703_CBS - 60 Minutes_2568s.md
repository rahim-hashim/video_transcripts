# Children of War; Interpol; Tasmanian Tiger | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ)
*  Over the years, we've reported on the more than half a million U.S. servicemen and women [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=0.0s)]
*  who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  I couldn't even make sense of it, but... [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=18.0s)]
*  Tonight, you'll hear PTSD can be contagious. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=20.32s)]
*  The worst of it was in seventh grade. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=25.04s)]
*  I kind of decided that my family would be better off without me here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=27.52s)]
*  On the banks of the Rhone River by a tranquil city park sits the highly secure global headquarters [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=35.04s)]
*  of Interpol. 196 countries are members of Interpol and share important intelligence [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=41.36s)]
*  about worldwide criminal activity. But there are questions about why some of those countries [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=48.0s)]
*  are still part of its alliance. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=54.32s)]
*  I'm just trying to understand how a country that is being investigated for mass murder [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=56.64s)]
*  can be a member in good standing with Interpol. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=62.24s)]
*  This is a Tasmanian tiger. Or was a Tasmanian tiger. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=68.72s)]
*  Most scientists believe the apex predator to be extinct. But like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=73.2s)]
*  Monster, plenty of people believe otherwise, that this tiger is still roaming this beautiful island. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=78.4s)]
*  And then all of a sudden was this mighty howl like this... [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=92.32s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=98.96s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=100.32s)]
*  Those stories tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  Two million Americans served in Afghanistan and Iraq. And at least 600,000 have been diagnosed [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=104.56s)]
*  with post-traumatic stress disorder. For the most part, the U.S. is doing better, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=112.48s)]
*  recognizing and treating these wounded warriors. But less well known are millions more who are in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=117.44s)]
*  need but remain hidden. But the U.S. is doing better, recognizing and treating these wounded [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=124.88s)]
*  are millions more who are in need but remain hidden. They are the children living with injured [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=130.56s)]
*  veterans. In a profound sense, PTSD can be contagious. Many children have become caregivers, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=137.12s)]
*  confronting depression and fear. And tonight you will hear that the stress can be so great, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=145.28s)]
*  it can lead to attempts of suicide. As we first reported earlier this year, two courageous families [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=152.16s)]
*  spoke to us so that others can know that help is on the way for America's children of war. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=159.76s)]
*  In 2011, Chuck Rotenberry was a Marine on patrol in Afghanistan when an improvised landmine [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=169.28s)]
*  detonated a few feet away. Which sent me down a hill 20, 30 feet, knocked me out, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=177.2s)]
*  caused catastrophic injuries to the Marine behind me and the Marine behind him. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  It was Rotenberry's second combat tour after Iraq. What happened to the Marine behind you [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=189.28s)]
*  who had stepped on the IED? He lost both his legs above the knee. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=196.24s)]
*  You and the medic put the tourniquets on him? Yes, sir. You saved his life? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=201.12s)]
*  I helped out, yeah. When Rotenberry came home from his [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=206.72000000000003s)]
*  seven-month deployment, his wife Liz was pregnant with their fourth child. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=211.12s)]
*  Chuck was suffering with a brain injury from a concussion and PTSD. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=216.4s)]
*  Chuck was struggling to just be in the house because he was dealing with so many emotions, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  mentally and physically. He was hiding in back rooms and I'd find him crying and he didn't [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  understand why he was crying. I didn't know whether I was coming or going. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=237.12s)]
*  Chuck kept a video diary as he dealt with self-isolation, anxiety, depression and denial. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=242.96s)]
*  One second I'm up super high, the next I'm not. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=252.32s)]
*  Chuck, who was that man who came home? In my head, it was me. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=257.76s)]
*  But I was very far from it, I think. At age seven, his son Christopher pitched in. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=262.96s)]
*  Over the years, he tried to shield his dad from triggers that set him off [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=269.68s)]
*  and shield his sisters from the emotional trauma. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  I was just worried about a lot of different things. Things that kids, I guess, at that age [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=278.24s)]
*  should not be worried about. I was just worried about the kids being in the hospital. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=285.2s)]
*  Things that kids at that age should not be worried about. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=291.2s)]
*  And it kind of evolved into kind of like a helplessness. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=295.92s)]
*  He was becoming almost like my husband. There were times where he wouldn't be able to go to school [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=303.12s)]
*  because he was so stressed internally from everything happening and I don't think he knew [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=309.2s)]
*  how to process it and understand it. I knew Christopher was starting to struggle [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=315.28s)]
*  with the weight of it all. The weight grew as Chris turned 12. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=320.88s)]
*  The worst of it was in seventh grade. I think I'd kind of decided that, you know, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=327.44s)]
*  my family would be better off without me here. I remember looking back on those days, it was just [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  chaos all the time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  I remember taking one of the dog's leashes upstairs and tied one into the bunk bed that we had, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=356.72s)]
*  my little brother's bunk bed, and I tried, you know, hanging myself and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=367.52s)]
*  it was working and my mom walked in on me kind of and I think I was kind of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=375.84s)]
*  about to pass out. I was kind of, you know, losing consciousness. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  Walking in and seeing what was happening to him and what he was really struggling with, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=389.44s)]
*  I knew everything else had to stop. Everything just had to stop and my focus had to be Christopher. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=394.64s)]
*  It's hard as a military family to own that when you're [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=415.6s)]
*  built with such pride and strength and you're seen as resilient as the word is in our community, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=419.44s)]
*  but it's okay to not be resilient and it's okay, it's okay to ask for help. Therapy saved your [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=426.64s)]
*  family. It did. Little was known about families like the Rotenberries until the wife of a wounded [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=433.68s)]
*  warrior spent 10 months at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Elizabeth Dole, former [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=443.84s)]
*  senator and transportation secretary, heard these families while caring for the late senator Bob [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=451.84s)]
*  Dole. And I met all of these young spouses, mothers, dads, who were caring for their wounded [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=458.88s)]
*  warriors. I don't think America is aware of what's happening. Most Americans have no idea [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=464.88s)]
*  what's happening in these military families. Less than 1% are serving in the military today. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=470.96s)]
*  Less than 1% are protecting our freedom and our security and it's so important for us to raise [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=477.68s)]
*  awareness of their challenges and their needs and provide them with the support. Dole created a [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=483.44s)]
*  foundation that commissioned studies of military caregivers. The studies discovered that more than [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=490.56s)]
*  one million are caring for those injured during the war since 9-11. Nearly half said they were [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=497.44s)]
*  overwhelmed. You know, they felt guilty really that they were leaning on their children so much, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=505.36s)]
*  needing their support and that this was causing problems for the children, their 2.3 million [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=512.32s)]
*  military children living in the homes of wounded warriors. One of them is Elizabeth Cornelius. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=520.0s)]
*  And I just need to make sure everybody's okay because if my mom isn't okay, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=526.88s)]
*  everything's gonna just fall. Elizabeth has helped her mom Ariel as long as she can remember. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=531.44s)]
*  Even before she was born, her dad brought terrifying memories home from a combat tour [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  in Iraq. Ariel told us his first episode came with a pizza delivery. The delivery man came up to the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=545.2s)]
*  door and knocked on the door and you know my husband didn't expect it and he had the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=553.28s)]
*  you know an immediate flashback and threw me to the floor and was yelling get down, get down, get [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=558.88s)]
*  down, get down. Even with that, he deployed to Iraq again in 2007 and to Afghanistan in 2011. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=563.04s)]
*  Ariel is a school teacher. Her husband is completely disabled by PTSD. He can't work [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  and wasn't up to speaking with us. 17-year-old Elizabeth has become something of a co-parent [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=581.52s)]
*  to a brother and a sister at home in Montana, shielding them, she told us, from episodes and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=588.48s)]
*  arguments. I just try to shield them as much as I can as my mom did for me and she did it for a [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=594.72s)]
*  very long time. A lot of it falls on myself and then she goes out and helps pick up the pieces [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=599.76s)]
*  that I can't. Her husband's worst crisis came on the anniversary of an attack that killed [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=605.12s)]
*  several of his fellow Marines. Oh gosh, he was extremely suicidal because of all the memories [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=612.48s)]
*  that came back. He was barely hanging on and it's just that regret, it's the flow of memories that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=619.5999999999999s)]
*  come in. Extremely suicidal, but Ariel found beds for inpatient mental health care can be scarce. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=630.72s)]
*  You know, Helena is an hour and a half, two hours away. Casper, Wyoming is eight plus hours away [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=640.32s)]
*  and they didn't have a bed. We then looked at Idaho, they didn't have a bed. We looked at Oregon, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=646.8000000000001s)]
*  they didn't have a bed. We still ended up having to wait three weeks before he could get the support [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=651.84s)]
*  he needed in Puget Sound, Washington and you know that's 10 hours away. Three weeks during this time [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=656.08s)]
*  you felt like he could commit suicide? At any point in time and we couldn't get help. Chasing [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  care in a crisis and navigating government health insurance raise stress for everyone. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  It's rough on her because she's been on the phone for hours and hours reading pamphlets, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=679.92s)]
*  trying to find us help. In 2018, Elizabeth Dole watched President Trump sign a law [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=687.36s)]
*  that expanded VA benefits for caregivers of the severely disabled. It offers a stipend, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=693.84s)]
*  access to health insurance and counseling. The Dole Foundation studies found that at least 100 [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=701.12s)]
*  other organizations are providing support which now include the Dole Foundation itself. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=708.96s)]
*  Steve Schwab is the CEO. How does the foundation help these children? One of the first things that [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=715.52s)]
*  we do is we offer emergency financial support to anybody who needs it. Second is peer support. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=721.84s)]
*  We're building a first of its kind peer support model that will link these children with other [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=727.2800000000001s)]
*  children like them for the first time in their lives. We offer on the ground, respite care, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=732.24s)]
*  backup care in the home to provide a trained health care worker to come in and back up that [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=738.0s)]
*  mom or dad so that that family can take a break together. One Dole Foundation partner called [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=742.48s)]
*  Our Military Kids paid fees to help keep the Cornelius children in sports. Their mom, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=748.96s)]
*  Ariel, says that even the little things help her husband. He is an amazing man and I can't wait for [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=756.4s)]

*  police organization was started 100 years ago when 20 countries, including the U.S., came together [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=907.28s)]
*  to fight international crime. Today, it has 196 members, connecting the New York Police Department, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=914.48s)]
*  Scotland Yard, police in Moscow, Mumbai, Manila. But as we first reported in January, for all its [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=919.84s)]
*  good work, Interpol has been accused of doing the dirty work of some of its more repressive members. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=927.84s)]
*  Russia, for one, has used Interpol to track down people who are in the country, and the [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=933.84s)]
*  U.S. has used it to track down people who have run afoul of President Vladimir Putin. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=939.76s)]
*  Last year, we visited Interpol in Lyon, France, and found an institution trying to navigate the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=947.28s)]
*  treacherous path between policing and politics. On the banks of the Rhône River by a tranquil [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  city park sits the highly secure global headquarters of Interpol. For the past decade, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=962.48s)]
*  it's been led by Jürgen Stock, a former vice president of the German Federal Police. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=969.04s)]
*  The purpose of Interpol is still the same, connecting police for a safer world. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=974.48s)]
*  As Interpol's secretary general, Stock manages operations in Lyon and regional offices on five [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=979.8399999999999s)]
*  continents. 900 employees work at the Lyon headquarters. Many are police officers on loan [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=986.88s)]
*  from member countries chosen for their expertise. They don't carry guns or make arrests, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=994.0s)]
*  but rather collect and share information with law enforcement agencies around the globe. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=999.6s)]
*  Interpol also has bureaus in each member country, including one in Washington, D.C., [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1005.12s)]
*  managed by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1010.96s)]
*  So what is the main mission of Interpol? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1014.64s)]
*  I would describe it as an information broker. We collect, we invite member countries to share [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1018.24s)]
*  information. We do analysis. We enrich the information. So Interpol's information is [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1022.72s)]
*  leading to arrests of high-level criminals, murderers, drug traffickers, those who are [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1028.96s)]
*  abusing children all around the world. Every single day that happens. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1034.48s)]
*  Last year, Interpol coordinated a crackdown on human trafficking and prostitution, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1038.72s)]
*  Operation Global Chain, that led to 212 arrests in 22 countries and the release of more than [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1044.08s)]
*  1,400 victims forced into criminality. It's been going after one of the world's most powerful crime [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1051.6s)]
*  organizations, Italy-based Endranghita. Thanks to Interpol, the second most wanted man in Italy, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1058.48s)]
*  Rocco Morabito, was arrested in Brazil after 23 years on the run. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1065.4399999999998s)]
*  We were able to identify him through images that were shared that allowed us to be sure it was [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1071.28s)]
*  the guy. Tattoos. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1077.2s)]
*  Tattoos. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1078.4s)]
*  Cyril Goux, a forensic expert from the French National Police, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1079.8400000000001s)]
*  oversees 19 massive databases, which are queried 20 million times a day. They are a compendium of [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1083.68s)]
*  crime, piracy, fugitives, illicit firearms, stolen travel documents. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1091.68s)]
*  My role is to make this information available to the end users. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1098.48s)]
*  Your members? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1103.76s)]
*  The member countries of Interpol. But for me, the customers, the end users, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1104.72s)]
*  these are the police officers who want to arrest those major criminals and providing them with [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1109.6000000000001s)]
*  actionable information everywhere around the world. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1115.92s)]
*  Interpol has a number of ways to alert its members, including a yellow notice for missing persons, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1119.44s)]
*  a black notice for unidentified bodies, perhaps most important, the red notice, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1125.8400000000001s)]
*  a closely guarded list of 74,000 of the world's most wanted fugitives, with the suspect's name, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1132.0s)]
*  picture, fingerprints, details of the alleged crime and the country seeking the arrest. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1139.52s)]
*  The red notice is not an international arrest warrant. That is also very often misunderstood. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1145.84s)]
*  How would you describe it? It seems like it's a digital wanted poster. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1151.36s)]
*  Yes. It's an alert that we are disseminating that somebody is wanted by a member country. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1154.8s)]
*  Each notice is vetted by a task force Secretary General Stock created to make sure it doesn't [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1161.1200000000001s)]
*  violate rules forbidding the use of Interpol for political, religious or racial persecution. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1167.44s)]
*  But the vetting is not foolproof. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1173.84s)]
*  Some of Interpol's more repressive members take advantage of red notices, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1176.64s)]
*  using fabricated charges to locate, detain and extradite people they want to get their hands on, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1181.2s)]
*  like political dissidents or innocent people who've merely displeased powerful officials. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1187.36s)]
*  Like any information sharing system, the information that you get out is only as [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1193.4399999999998s)]
*  good as the information that you put in. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1197.4399999999998s)]
*  Rhys Davies on the left and Ben Keefe are barristers, British lawyers, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1199.6799999999998s)]
*  who help people accused of crimes to navigate Interpol's complex bureaucracy. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1204.56s)]
*  Our clients come to us and say, we've been accused in a particular state of a criminal [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1210.1599999999999s)]
*  offense which has been fabricated for political reasons. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1215.76s)]
*  And Interpol's just taken this at face value, issued a red notice. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1218.56s)]
*  Both concede Interpol does a lot of good, despite a yearly budget of $170 million, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1223.76s)]
*  which is about the size of the Omaha Police Department. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1230.96s)]
*  Their constitution says that they are meant to believe they're member states. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1234.24s)]
*  And so when a member state, Russia, China, Turkey, whose rule of law is often non-existent, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1238.0s)]
*  say to them a particular person is wanted for a criminal offense, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1245.6s)]
*  they are bound by the constitution to believe them. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1249.36s)]
*  Does Interpol view all the information that comes out of all of them as equal? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1252.32s)]
*  This is one of our main frustrations is that Interpol don't penalize countries properly. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1257.36s)]
*  They want everyone in their club. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1262.6399999999999s)]
*  They want everyone in the club. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1263.68s)]
*  When a country is clearly egregiously breaching the rules and manipulating the system on a gross [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1264.8799999999999s)]
*  scale, they don't suspend them. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1270.72s)]
*  They've not suspended Russia. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1272.88s)]
*  That's a Russia is still an active member of Interpol. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1275.28s)]
*  Russia accounts for nearly half of the red notices Interpol makes public. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1278.4s)]
*  According to a Russian police official, its Interpol bureau in Moscow helped arrest and [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1283.28s)]
*  extradite more than 100 criminals in 2021 and in 2022 helped nab the founder of the world's [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1288.96s)]
*  largest dark net criminal marketplace called Hydra. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1297.2s)]
*  But some of the information Russia gives Interpol is suspect. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1301.04s)]
*  Members of Congress, human rights groups, and the European Union have labeled Russia [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1305.44s)]
*  a serial abuser of red notices. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1310.32s)]
*  So Russia is widely viewed as being fairly brazen in its attempt to manipulate the system. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1313.04s)]
*  The famous example that we often talk about is Bill Browder. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1318.32s)]
*  Bill Browder is a London-based American-born financier. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1322.72s)]
*  He made his fortune in Russia but has spent the last 11 years on the run from President [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1327.04s)]
*  Vladimir Putin after he and his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, exposed corruption by Russian government [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1332.72s)]
*  officials. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1340.0s)]
*  Magnitsky was arrested and died after being beaten in a Moscow prison. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1341.12s)]
*  Browder was convicted in absentia on suspect fraud charges. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1346.6399999999999s)]
*  The Kremlin turned to Interpol to bring him in. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1351.76s)]
*  So how many times by your account has Russia tried to arrest you by way of Interpol? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1355.2s)]
*  Eight times. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1362.16s)]
*  I must hold the Guinness Book of World Records for the number of times they've tried to abuse [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1363.6000000000001s)]
*  Interpol. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1368.96s)]
*  His closest call came in 2018 when he was visiting Spain. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1370.16s)]
*  I opened the door of the hotel and outside the door just about to knock is the manager [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1374.64s)]
*  of the hotel and two uniformed officers from the Spanish police. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1379.92s)]
*  I pull out my passport. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1384.3200000000002s)]
*  I hand it to the one of the two police officers and he said, you're under arrest. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1386.0800000000002s)]
*  And I said, what for? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1391.04s)]
*  And he said, Interpol, Russia. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1392.48s)]
*  The hotel manager told him to collect his things from the bedroom. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1395.04s)]
*  Once out of sight, Browder grabbed his phone and sent out this tweet. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1399.28s)]
*  At the time, I had about 100,000 followers and I tweeted out, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1404.0800000000002s)]
*  urgent, being arrested in Madrid, Spain right now. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1407.04s)]
*  That was quick thinking. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1410.16s)]
*  This is not the first time I had this worry. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1411.28s)]
*  They've been chasing me with Interpol for a long time. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1413.6s)]
*  And so I'm sitting in the back of the police car and because they hadn't taken away my phone, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1416.56s)]
*  I took a picture of the back of their heads. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1420.72s)]

*  What were you hoping to accomplish? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1431.92s)]
*  I'm hoping to wake the whole world up to the fact that I'm being arrested. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1433.36s)]
*  I didn't want to be slipped into the back of a, you know, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1436.3999999999999s)]

*  What did you think was happening or was going to happen? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1444.72s)]
*  If I sent to Russia, I would be killed. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1448.1599999999999s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1450.08s)]
*  While Browder stayed locked in a holding cell, his tweets went around the world. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1451.6799999999998s)]
*  The chief of police comes back with a translator and says, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1457.12s)]
*  we've just gotten off the phone with Interpol general secretary in Lyon. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1460.96s)]

*  Wow. As a result of your tweets? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1469.12s)]

*  Are you fearful that this could happen again? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1473.4399999999998s)]
*  Every time I cross the border, my heart starts beating a little bit faster. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1477.4399999999998s)]
*  We asked Jurgen Stock why, after all this, Russia hasn't been suspended from Interpol, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1482.1599999999999s)]
*  especially considering the UN is investigating Russia for war crimes in Ukraine. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1488.32s)]
*  I'm just trying to understand how a country that is being investigated for mass murder [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1494.24s)]
*  can be a member in good standing with Interpol. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1499.84s)]
*  Interpol introduced some measures when the conflict started [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1503.6s)]
*  to avoid any political abuse of our systems. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1508.32s)]
*  But we also decided to keep, let's say, the channels of information open. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1512.4s)]
*  Russia is hardly the only country to use Interpol to do its dirty work. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1518.56s)]
*  Bahrain, for example, used Interpol to nab a professional soccer player, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1523.2800000000002s)]
*  an outspoken critic of the government, at the Bangkok airport in 2018. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1527.6000000000001s)]
*  He spent two and a half months in a Thai prison. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1532.64s)]
*  China used a red notice to arrest this Chinese Uighur activist in Morocco in 2021. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1536.0s)]
*  He remains in prison awaiting extradition. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1542.16s)]
*  And Qatar issued a red notice for this Scottish engineer in 2022 [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1545.1200000000001s)]
*  over a disputed $5,000 bank loan. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1550.0s)]
*  He spent two months in an Iraqi prison. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1553.36s)]
*  All of these red notices were eventually rescinded, but not before lives were upended. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1556.48s)]
*  I don't know how to characterize the people who get caught up in this. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1562.8s)]
*  Are they collateral damage? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1567.28s)]
*  No, I would never call that collateral damage. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1569.6s)]
*  And we are investing all we can to ensure that every piece of information in our databases [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1572.24s)]
*  are compliant with our rules and regulations. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1578.88s)]
*  But you know, and we have heard of incidents where people are languishing in jail [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1581.0400000000002s)]
*  because of erroneous information that was sent out by Interpol. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1588.48s)]
*  I'm not saying that the system is perfect. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1594.5600000000002s)]
*  We see wrong decisions on a national level, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1597.2800000000002s)]
*  and we have seen wrong decisions also in Interpol. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1599.44s)]
*  That is correct a small number of cases. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1602.3200000000002s)]
*  Interpol admits in 2022, 304 of nearly 24,000 wanted person alerts [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1605.44s)]
*  were found to violate its rules and were eventually denied or deleted. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1612.96s)]
*  The organization declined to share which countries were the worst offenders. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1617.76s)]
*  There are well-documented cases against Russia, China, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1622.72s)]
*  for repeatedly abusing the Interpol notices. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1630.24s)]
*  Why not name and shame these countries? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1634.64s)]
*  Because we believe this is not in the interest of international police cooperation. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1638.88s)]
*  You need to have a platform where information is being collected from different parts of the world [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1642.96s)]
*  where criminal groups are operating. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1647.12s)]
*  We want to provide a channel even between states that have diplomatic difficulties [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1649.36s)]
*  or even are in conflict. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1653.84s)]
*  Our decision is not to police a member country in terms of their human rights agenda. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1656.08s)]
*  That's not our role as a technical police organization. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1660.48s)]
*  That's not justice though. It's not justice. We get it right most of the time. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1663.44s)]
*  British barristers Rhys Davies and Ben Keith say if Interpol is to survive another 100 years, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1666.4s)]
*  it must learn to police itself. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1673.68s)]
*  We're concerned about the rule of law and human rights, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1676.88s)]
*  and Interpol are concerned about trying to catch people who are allegedly criminals. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1678.64s)]
*  A lot of innocent people get caught up in the middle. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1682.96s)]
*  It feels a bit like that's the sort of price they're prepared to pay for catching the bad guys. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1685.28s)]
*  And we think that the price that is paid is far too high. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1690.56s)]
*  There's the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland, and in the Himalayas there's the Yeti, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1704.88s)]
*  the abominable snowman. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1709.28s)]

*  there's the thylacine. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1716.0s)]
*  A creature, as we first reported in April, that brings out folklore and folks, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1717.52s)]
*  armed with grainy images, convinced they've seen the thing. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1722.24s)]
*  But unlike other mythical creatures, the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1726.0s)]
*  actually indisputably existed, an apex predator the size of a small wolf that roamed the island [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1730.32s)]
*  as recently as last century, which gives hope to so many obsessives, dreamers, and true believers [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1736.48s)]
*  looking for the Tasmanian tiger in the bush, and as you'll see, in the lab. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1742.24s)]
*  This is a story that says as much about human nature as it does nature, nature. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1747.6s)]
*  Further proof that even in the face of science and logic, passion survives in the wild just fine. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1752.24s)]
*  You've been doing this how many years now? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1760.8s)]
*  I've been doing this for over 30 years, and every day is an adventure. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1762.56s)]
*  All right, here we go. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1768.8s)]
*  Well. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1770.0s)]
*  Getting there wasn't easy, but Adrian Richo Richardson, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1772.8799999999999s)]
*  a retired military man turned self-declared tiger seeker, retraced his steps. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1776.8s)]
*  Tramping around the dense outback of Tasmania on January 28, 2017, 1245 p.m., he heard the sound. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1782.56s)]
*  And then all of a sudden was this mighty howl like this. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1791.12s)]
*  This was gobsmacked. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1794.88s)]
*  The hairs on my arm and my neck stood on end, and as that call finished, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1798.96s)]
*  another one come from the other side of the forestry track. Another howl like that. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1806.0800000000002s)]
*  That one sound like? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1811.92s)]
*  Exactly like. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1812.96s)]
*  Richo craned his neck but saw no creature. Still, he's sure of what it was, a Tasmanian tiger. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1815.8400000000001s)]
*  That whole environment went quiet for about a minute. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1823.2s)]
*  There was an unbelievable feeling. I just can't explain it. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1828.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you're still emotional talking about this. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1831.92s)]
*  Look, I'm going to remember that call for the time I die. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1834.0800000000002s)]
*  And then I had to try and prove to others what I've heard. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1838.0800000000002s)]
*  When he returned to his home in Hobart, Tasmania's capital, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1842.4s)]
*  he didn't go down to the pub to share his account. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1845.76s)]
*  No, he took to his desk and stayed up writing a detailed report, flush with 22 footnotes. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1848.56s)]
*  What my passion is, it's the thylacine. I know it's there. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1855.44s)]
*  And this only reinforced your faith? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1859.6s)]

*  the tiger was put on the extinct list in 1986. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1935.52s)]
*  Yet, putting the mania in Tasmania, the search became a national obsession. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1939.28s)]
*  And the Tasmanian tiger, not the Tasmanian devil, became a sort of local mascot. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1944.0800000000002s)]

*  I know several people who've got clusters of cameras in very remote areas, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1981.44s)]
*  serviced remotely by satellite, and who go and check on the cameras with their own helicopter, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1987.52s)]
*  all sorts of things. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1995.76s)]
*  I've moved way beyond the guy with binoculars saying, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=1996.56s)]
*  I think I may have seen something. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2000.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2001.6000000000001s)]
*  He can't help notice. No one ever quite captures a clear image. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2003.3600000000001s)]
*  Still, reported sightings come by the thousands. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2008.32s)]
*  Have you ever gotten a report or ever looked into something that gave you a little pause? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2012.16s)]
*  Yes. Sometimes people are dead accurate with the times, the places, the distances, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2016.8s)]
*  and they're very good naturalists. Often don't exaggerate. They take their skills very seriously. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2025.76s)]
*  And it's very hard to say to those people, I don't think you saw a thylacine. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2031.6s)]
*  For the devoted army of seekers, the investment isn't just one of hope and time. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2037.84s)]
*  Each year, Richo spends more than he cares to admit dollars on trail cam batteries alone. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2042.72s)]
*  How much money have you sunk into this accession? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2049.52s)]
*  Sir, I wouldn't like to speculate. And please don't tell my wife. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2051.92s)]
*  Make it our secret. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2058.16s)]
*  That's our secret. She often asks, and I go, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2059.12s)]
*  don't get your hair done, darling. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2063.12s)]
*  Go shopping. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2066.08s)]
*  Stop that one. Can I stop that one? Can you redo that one again? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2066.64s)]
*  In the bush, we met another enthusiast, Chris Rayberg, who flies down from mainland Australia [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2071.52s)]
*  and approaches the search in the manner of a CSI detective. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2077.44s)]
*  Apart from the cameras, I gather you've been scouring for prints, fur, even poo? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2081.44s)]
*  Yeah, everything. So scats. Footprints is a big one. And I found a series of 18, 19 individual [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2088.48s)]
*  steps in a track line that are an excellent match for Tassie Tiger. Not only are they an [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2095.28s)]
*  excellent match, the quality of the prints is pristine. Scats, keep an eye out, check it out. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2100.48s)]
*  What's the animal been eating? And calls, if you hear them. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2105.44s)]
*  There are even tracking collectives. Richo was part of the Booth Richardson Tiger team. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2109.6000000000004s)]
*  I thank you for joining us on what we believe is a historic day. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2115.28s)]
*  Which made worldwide news in 2017 after calling a press conference to announce a sighting. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2120.4s)]
*  But when they provided this image as proof, Nick Mooney assessed it as a chance, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2126.56s)]
*  but not an official confirmation. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2131.36s)]
*  What is the middle ground? You can be right, you can be lying or... [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2133.6800000000003s)]
*  You can have an illusion and there's all sorts of ways that memory can be [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2138.0s)]
*  affected by time. I've had lots of talks with psychiatrists and [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2145.04s)]
*  detectives trying to figure out this. You really often have to make a choice, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2149.52s)]
*  a personal call in the end. To essentially tell them they're wrong and their mind is [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2154.4s)]
*  deceiving them. You can't tell them that because you don't know. Essentially, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2159.28s)]
*  if you weren't there, you don't know. Richo and all the other seekers won't [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2162.48s)]
*  have to wait long. They won't even have to go into the bush if a group of tech investors [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2165.84s)]
*  and biologists deliver on their goal. Andrew Pass counts himself among the Tassie Tiger [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2170.72s)]
*  trends fixed. He comes to the quest, though, armed not with binoculars, but a microscope [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2176.48s)]
*  in his tiger lab. Envision that day when you're not just wearing it on a pin? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2182.16s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. I think about it all the time, what it would be like to be in that landscape and just [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2186.32s)]
*  see one walking past in the bush, an actual one rather than a crappy photograph. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2192.0s)]
*  Tell us exactly what you're doing. We can't magically bring the Tasmanian Tiger back. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2196.4s)]
*  We have to start with a living cell and then engineer our thylacine back into existence. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2201.52s)]
*  So the way you do that is you find the closest living relative to your animal that has gone [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2208.24s)]
*  extinct. And for us, that is a small, massifule species called the fat-tailed damart. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2212.96s)]
*  A developmental biologist at the University of Melbourne, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2218.64s)]
*  Pasc has raised $15 million for a de-extinction project that recalls Jurassic Park. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2221.84s)]
*  In partnership with American company Colossal Biosciences, which counts, wait for it, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2228.32s)]
*  Leonardo DiCaprio, Paris Hilton and even the CIA among its backers. He's adamant he'll replicate [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2234.0s)]
*  the genome of a dunard, a mouse-like marsupial, and turn it into a much larger Tassie Tiger. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2240.48s)]
*  We'll let him explain. We examine all of its DNA. We compare that to the DNA of your extinct species, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2247.12s)]
*  the Tasmanian Tiger, and we look at everywhere that those two genomes or those two piles of DNA, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2253.84s)]
*  if you like, are different. And once you've identified those differences, it's just a matter [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2259.6800000000003s)]
*  of then going in and making all of those edits to turn your fat-tailed dunard genome or cell [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2265.1200000000003s)]
*  into a thylacine cell. And you're saying that dunard, that little field mouse marsupial dunard [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2271.92s)]
*  is closer than say the Tasmanian Devil. But that little dunard is a ferocious carnivore, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2277.92s)]
*  even though it's very, very small. And it's a very good surrogate for us to be able to do all [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2283.52s)]
*  this editing in. A native of Minnesota, Chris Helgen is director of the Australian Museum [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2287.7599999999998s)]
*  Research Institute in Sydney. He understands the push to de-extinct the Tassie Tiger. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2293.36s)]
*  This is one of my favorite mammals. Really? And I love all mammals. I am a mammal guy. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2299.2s)]
*  This is a special, special animal. He took us upstairs to his lab to show us why. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2306.24s)]
*  So this is Tasmanian Tiger of the 19th century. See the stripes, see the thick tail, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2312.88s)]
*  see this gaping mouth with the sharp teeth. What do you make of this de-extinction effort [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2319.76s)]
*  with respect to the Tasmanian Tiger? You know, I would be the first person to line up [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2325.76s)]
*  to see this animal if it could be somehow brought back from extinction. That said, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2330.08s)]
*  Helgen is the skeptic. Gently explaining that wishing Tassie Tigers were running rampant [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2335.36s)]
*  doesn't overcome science. The idea that you could actually tweak the DNA of this mouth-sized animal [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2340.96s)]
*  into making this apex predator of Australia, it stretches imagination in many different ways. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2349.28s)]
*  This is an impossible project. We all have optimism. We all have innovation. What they're [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2357.44s)]
*  saying is we're going to modify the genome of a dunnart to create a genetically modified dunnart [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2362.7200000000003s)]
*  that might look a bit more like a thylacine. Maybe we'll be able to tweak it genetically and [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2369.44s)]
*  it gets a bit bigger. Maybe we'll be able to tweak it genetically and it has some stripes on it. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2374.2400000000002s)]
*  But there's about a thousand and one steps in between. Helgen has thought about the source of [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2379.52s)]
*  the current Tassie Tiger passion and wonders how much of it is driven by remorse. It's a special [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2385.12s)]
*  symbol about Australia and about what we've lost. We've had a lot of extinctions here in the last [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2391.6s)]
*  hundred, two hundred years. Thirty mammals alone. So in the United States only one or two mammal [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2398.48s)]
*  species have disappeared entirely. So why are people taking this seriously and why are people [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2405.04s)]
*  investing so much in this? So many people have the dream if we could just get this animal back. Maybe [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2411.12s)]
*  it would help us think different about extinction or the guilt that we might feel of having removed [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2418.2400000000002s)]
*  such a special animal from the planet. Whether they imagine it might be still hiding in Tasmania [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2423.92s)]
*  or in a lab to be reborn, there's this burning hope. Richo reckons that if his countrymen in [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2430.0s)]
*  the DNA sequencing labs can resurrect a Tassie Tiger, good on him. But regardless, he'll continue [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2437.76s)]
*  coming here. Faith unshaken, he's certain this animal, most famous for being extinct, is not [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2444.4s)]
*  extinct at all. If someone accused you of being obsessed, would you please guilty? Oh, sir, I'll [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2452.24s)]
*  put my hand up to that. Your honor, I am guilty. You're a Tasmanian Tiger obsessive. I am indeed. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2458.16s)]
*  It's been my love. Why is that? Why have you continued to search so long for this? I just [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2464.0s)]
*  know it's there. I do. In my own heart, I know it's there. And if it isn't there, well, we say [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2469.7599999999998s)]
*  what's the harm in searching. Coming to the planet's sub-basement, bush bashing this gorgeous [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2478.16s)]
*  terrain, there are worse ways and places to spend your days. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2484.08s)]
*  So when you look out there and you see all that green, what do you think? I see money leaving [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2496.08s)]
*  America. Pure insanity. You're noticing mis and disinformation on your own social media. This is [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2510.72s)]
*  the world we're taking in and we can make impacts and try to improve it. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2516.72s)]
*  Is this a battle of rich versus poor? In part it is. Black versus white? In part it is. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2520.0s)]
*  If you're not willing to protect a place like this, then what are you willing to protect? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAw-3pxguQQ&t=2530.24s)]
