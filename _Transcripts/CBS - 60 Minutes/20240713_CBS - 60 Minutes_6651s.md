**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE)
*  60 Minutes is constantly on the lookout for places we've never been before. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=0.0s)]
*  So when our late colleague Bob Simon heard about a magical place in the Hebrides Islands [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  off the coast of Scotland, known for making some of the great whiskeys in the world, well, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  the story spoke to him. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=27.8s)]
*  The place is called Islay, and it's one of five whisky-producing regions in Scotland [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=29.72s)]
*  that make an expensive type of scotch called single malt. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=34.56s)]
*  Islay's distilleries turn out relatively small amounts of their own handcrafted brands [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=38.28s)]
*  for a worldwide luxury market that's more than doubled in size in the last decade and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  become the spirit equivalent of the fine wine business. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Bob liked good scotch in beautiful places, so he went off to Scotland. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  He died before he could finish the piece, leaving behind a stack of videotapes and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=56.96s)]
*  some random notes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=61.32s)]
*  We decided to finish it for him and raise a glass in his memory. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  Islay is a small island 20 miles off the west coast of Scotland. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=70.08s)]
*  There are few trees, miles of windswept heather, and some of the most fertile agricultural [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=74.08s)]
*  land in Scotland. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=79.36s)]
*  There are sheep and cattle everywhere and an abundance of wildlife. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=81.08s)]
*  But that's not why people come here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=85.64s)]
*  This is, eight small distilleries that produce some of the world's finest single malt whiskeys. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=87.7s)]
*  This is the whole lifeblood of this island and everybody on it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=94.16s)]
*  This is all we know. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=97.88s)]
*  Jim McEwen has been working at Islay's distillery since he was 15 years old. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=99.48s)]
*  He's now master of the works at Brooklottie. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=104.16s)]
*  I just thank God that he chose the Scots and gave them whisky because we appreciate the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=107.08s)]
*  gift and we look after it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=113.36s)]
*  They've been making it here since the 15th century when supposedly some monks taught [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=115.96s)]
*  the locals how to use barley, water and yeast to make a spirit the Scots now call the water [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=120.36s)]
*  of life. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=126.63999999999999s)]
*  They've been perfecting it for 600 years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=127.83999999999999s)]
*  The distilleries are easy to find but hard to pronounce. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  As Bob Simon noted, they get harder to pronounce the more you visit. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=134.48s)]
*  For us guys on the west coast of Scotland, whisky is a religion because it's a provider. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  And the great thing about whisky is it's not just a drink. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=152.2s)]
*  It's much more than that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=154.92s)]
*  Have you ever watched some old Hollywood movies? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=156.32s)]
*  Yes, I have. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=158.48s)]
*  Scotch was always portrayed in Hollywood as a whisky when you were down or you were in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  trouble. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=163.92s)]
*  The one thing that was going to get you back in your feet and out there was the Scotch. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=164.92s)]
*  Today if you're down on your luck you probably can't afford an Islay single malt. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=169.72s)]
*  The good ones started around $70 a bottle. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  The rare ones can go for hundreds of dollars a glass at chic whisky bars around the world [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  where they're known for their distinctive smoky taste. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=181.88s)]
*  It comes from peat, the mossy earthen fuel that's cut from bogs on the island. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=185.76s)]
*  Whisky was used to heat Scottish homes for centuries and is still used to toast the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=191.16s)]
*  barley at Islay distilleries. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=195.56s)]
*  John Campbell is the master distiller at LaFroy, one of the top selling single malts in America. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=198.24s)]
*  Peat is the thing that makes Islay unique and it really resonates with people and it [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=203.56s)]
*  just engenders a kind of love-hate relationship. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=207.84s)]
*  And the people that love it absolutely love it with a passion. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=211.64s)]
*  And there seems to be no shortage of them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=216.44s)]
*  Islay is not easy to get to, usually requiring multiple flights, a long drive and a two hour [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=218.84s)]
*  ferry ride. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=224.28s)]
*  Yet enthusiasts continue to make the pilgrimage, especially for the Whisky Festival. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  We get literally thousands upon thousands of single malt tourists coming here. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=230.88s)]
*  They come from all over the world just to set foot on Islay. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=236.44s)]
*  To study it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=239.94s)]
*  No, to drink it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=240.94s)]
*  It's lovely. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  It's clean. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  It's fresh. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=244.60000000000002s)]
*  It's vibrant. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  Actually, Whisky Fest is a celebration of Islay's culture, but mostly it's about drinking. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=246.68s)]
*  Absolutely beautiful. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=252.04s)]
*  No off-notes at all. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=253.04s)]
*  As they listen to Jim McEwen extol the virtues of brook Lottie, the novitiates, connoisseurs [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  and whiskey snobs approached each glass with reverence bordering on the religious. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=259.76s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=265.04s)]
*  The fruit in that is incredible. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=266.6s)]
*  As the glass is empty, the smiles got bigger. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=269.2s)]
*  But the islanders will tell you that all of this warmth and good feeling comes not [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=271.96s)]
*  from the alcohol and the spirits, but from the spirit of the place. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=276.44s)]
*  It is almost mystical, beautiful, dramatic and quiet. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=280.79999999999995s)]
*  There's no road rage, barely any traffic. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=285.88s)]
*  If you do get hung up, it's probably because of a farm animal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  They have the right of way. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=292.06s)]
*  And if you do happen upon people, they'll almost always greet you with the Islay Wave. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=295.06s)]
*  Everybody just waves because it's just friendly. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=300.64s)]
*  There's not so many of us, so you just wave to say hi. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  It's what Elsa Hayes liked about the island when she moved her family here from London [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=305.41999999999996s)]
*  to take a manager's position at one of Islay's thriving distilleries. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=309.88s)]
*  It's strange, is it not? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=313.84s)]
*  It's such a small place with so few people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=314.84s)]
*  Your products are known everywhere in the world. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=319.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=322.4s)]
*  It makes us all very proud. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=323.4s)]
*  It does. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=324.4s)]
*  There's such a boom worldwide for single malts. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=325.4s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=330.5s)]
*  You can really feel that on the island. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=331.5s)]
*  A lot of the distilleries have doubled production. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=332.86s)]
*  So there's a lot of opportunities there as well. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=336.82s)]
*  And there's no reason to believe that that won't continue. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=338.9s)]
*  Well, times are good, people drink. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=341.98s)]
*  Times are bad, people drink. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=343.94s)]
*  Is it possible to be socially acceptable to be a teetotaler on this island? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=346.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=351.9s)]
*  Are there any? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=352.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=353.9s)]
*  I'm not one of them. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=354.9s)]
*  Over the years, the island's people have learned how to entertain themselves, often [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=358.34s)]
*  at gatherings called Caeli's, which feature traditional dance and sad songs, mostly about [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=362.34s)]
*  leaving Islay and yearning to return. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=368.34s)]
*  To set with my love on the bridge above the rippling waterfall. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=371.09999999999997s)]
*  If this looks and feels a lot like Ireland, that's no coincidence. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=382.02s)]
*  It's only 25 miles away. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=397.78s)]
*  They come from the same tribe, share the same Celtic culture and Gaelic language, not to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=399.62s)]
*  mention a love of good whiskey that gets them through stormy weather and the long winter [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=405.06s)]
*  nights. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=409.9s)]
*  There are no movie theaters on island, no dry cleaners, no supermarkets, no McDonald's, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=411.20000000000005s)]
*  at least in the fast food business. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=416.20000000000005s)]
*  Jim McEwen says there's a long list of things that Islay doesn't have and doesn't want. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=418.20000000000005s)]
*  We don't have any crime. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  We don't have mugging, carjacking, house baking, rape, just dope drugs. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=425.76000000000005s)]
*  We don't have that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=433.76000000000005s)]
*  You can keep that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=435.0s)]
*  You're very welcome to it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=436.0s)]
*  How do you explain the fact that there's no crime here? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=437.28000000000003s)]

*  If you commit a crime in a small community, you will be ostracized and have to leave. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  Not only that, your family, your children and your children's children will be remembered [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=447.52000000000004s)]
*  as the children of the man who committed the crime. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  Most Scots are forthright, practical people who are proud of their country and the fact [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=457.24s)]
*  that their most famous export has withstood the test of time. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=461.36s)]
*  They see themselves as artisans and making whiskey is more about art and alchemy than [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=465.68s)]
*  manufacturing. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=470.6s)]
*  Every distiller has their own secrets and superstitions. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=472.16s)]
*  We'll give you the unclassified two-minute tour. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=474.96s)]
*  Sorry, we can't offer you free samples. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=478.44s)]
*  It begins with a bit of trickery on the molting floor when barley that's been soaked in water [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  is spread out and raked over and over to convince the grain it's spring and time to germinate, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=487.16s)]
*  releasing the starches that are locked inside. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=493.4s)]
*  It's then dried with peat smoke to add flavor and ground into flour, sometimes with 19th [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  century machinery and then mixed with hot water, transforming the starches into a sugary [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=503.12s)]
*  concoction called mash. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=509.64s)]
*  Smell that, Bob? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=511.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=512.88s)]
*  You can smell the goodness. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=513.88s)]
*  Yeast is then added, changing the sugar into alcohol, a primitive ale which is then cooked [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  a couple of times in copper stills where the vapor is collected and condensed into this [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=520.88s)]
*  clear liquid. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=526.1600000000001s)]
*  And that's the stuff we want to go into the barrel. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=527.1600000000001s)]
*  But what I'm looking at is this looks like rubbing alcohol. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=529.9200000000001s)]
*  This is in fact a whiskey. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=533.4s)]
*  It's very good. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=534.64s)]
*  If you need a rub, there's no doubt about it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=535.64s)]
*  I bet it would be good. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=537.12s)]
*  But once this goes into the barrel, from then it's just time. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  It's just time. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=541.52s)]
*  And it's a great journey, you know. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=542.52s)]
*  This is a child, but the cask is the mother. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=544.9200000000001s)]
*  And that's what makes the journey. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=547.88s)]
*  If you give a good cask, you're bound to get a good child. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=549.96s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=553.48s)]
*  It takes less than three weeks to make, but requires at least 10 years of aging in these [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=554.64s)]
*  oak casks, which add flavor and color to turn it into world-class single malt whiskey. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=559.08s)]
*  You'll see some of the names. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=564.44s)]
*  There's Clement Springs, Buffalo Trees, Jim Beam. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  Bob was surprised to learn that 97% of the casks used to make single malt whiskey had [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=571.84s)]
*  been previously used to age American bourbon and bought secondhand from U.S. distillers. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=577.68s)]
*  It's testimony to the ingenuity and frugality of the Scots, who have very few oak trees. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=583.92s)]
*  Without the American bottle, there would be no whiskey industry. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=589.24s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=591.84s)]
*  A sophisticated palate will detect a hint of the oak and bourbon in Isla's single malt, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=593.08s)]
*  as well as the sweetness of sherry that comes from wine casks bought in Europe. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=598.16s)]
*  Before the final product is sold, it will have done time in a number of different casks. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=603.24s)]
*  Master distiller Jim McEwen is the one who decides when to rotate them and when each [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=608.92s)]
*  barrel is ready to be bottled. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=613.32s)]
*  He opened a young cask for Bob to sample. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=615.58s)]
*  I would describe that as mellow yellow, absolutely pure. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=618.12s)]
*  And it's only seven years old. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=623.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=625.0s)]
*  Young whiskeys are like young people. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=626.0s)]
*  They're vibrant, they're full of life. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=627.0s)]
*  In fact, this for me is like coming home from work. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=629.08s)]
*  At the end of the day, I work really hard. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=632.6800000000001s)]
*  Nobody appreciates me. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=636.44s)]
*  My wife doesn't appreciate me. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=637.6s)]
*  My kids don't appreciate me. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=638.76s)]
*  Life's a bitch. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=640.32s)]
*  So what I do is... [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=641.32s)]
*  A couple of glasses of that and it doesn't matter. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=642.32s)]
*  A couple of shots of that and I am the king of the world. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=644.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=647.12s)]
*  You know, frankly, I never liked this stuff, but the way you're talking me into it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=648.12s)]
*  But you've got to check every barrel. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=652.0400000000001s)]
*  Certainly, also. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=653.36s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=654.36s)]
*  McEwan is the man responsible for the taste and consistency of the whiskeys at Brooklottie, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=656.16s)]
*  which requires a very personal involvement with the product. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=661.36s)]
*  I have heard you described as the cask whisperer. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=664.76s)]
*  I do talk to casks. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=671.08s)]
*  In what language? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=672.4s)]
*  Mainly English. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=673.4s)]
*  It depends on many whiskies I've had. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=674.4s)]
*  If I do a few whiskies, I tend to revert to the Gaelic language when I'm talking to the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=677.08s)]
*  cask. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=680.52s)]
*  It's just one of these things. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=681.52s)]
*  You go into the warehouse and you pop the bung out, you draw your sample, yeah, and [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=682.72s)]
*  you look at it and you think, wow, you're beautiful. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=687.84s)]
*  But you're not just ready yet. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=690.52s)]
*  Tell you what, I'm going to come back and see you in three months, okay? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=692.76s)]
*  And other times you find a cask which is so incredibly good, you can't not speak. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=696.72s)]
*  You say, oh my God, you are the most beautiful thing I have ever tasted in my life. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=702.68s)]
*  You know, and you think, oh, jeez, I just want to share this with somebody. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=707.56s)]
*  But there's nobody around. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=711.2s)]
*  It's just me and the cask. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=712.2s)]
*  We'll stay. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=713.48s)]
*  On most days, McEwen devotes several hours to quality control, checking up on several [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=715.48s)]
*  hundred casks. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=720.1600000000001s)]
*  But it's a fantastic job nosing and tasting whiskies. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=721.1600000000001s)]
*  And you can still walk out of here in the evening. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=726.48s)]
*  Occasionally I need some help. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=728.32s)]
*  There's no doubt about that, yeah. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=729.9200000000001s)]
*  Dying devotion to one's whisky is apparently not all that unusual. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=733.1600000000001s)]
*  While we were on Isleb, the camera crew ran into a party of Canadians, the friends and [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=737.48s)]
*  family of a deceased single malt lover named Bill, who wanted his ashes scattered in the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=742.36s)]
*  waters opposite his favorite distillery. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=747.72s)]
*  Funds for the pilgrimage were set aside in his will. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=751.12s)]
*  That's what I wanted. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=753.9200000000001s)]
*  It's good. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=756.9200000000001s)]
*  It's good. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=757.9200000000001s)]
*  To Bill. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=758.9200000000001s)]
*  To Bill. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=759.9200000000001s)]
*  To Bill. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=760.9200000000001s)]
*  To Bill. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=761.9200000000001s)]
*  Now he's happy. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=762.9200000000001s)]
*  Now he's happy. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=763.9200000000001s)]
*  Now he's happy. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=765.92s)]
*  Now he's happy. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=766.92s)]
*  After that, the only thing left was for Bob to say goodbye to Jim McEwen. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=770.92s)]
*  And it turned out to be last call for our old pal, Bob Simon. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=774.92s)]
*  Cheers, Bob. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=779.92s)]
*  Hope you've enjoyed this little visit here. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=780.92s)]
*  You're speaking in the past. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=782.92s)]
*  It's not over. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=783.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=784.92s)]
*  I'm going to get you out of here, man. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=785.92s)]
*  This is costing me a fortune. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=786.92s)]
*  The relationship between Cuba and the United States was stuck in pretty much the same bad [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=794.92s)]
*  place for half a century. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=806.7199999999999s)]
*  But things have been changing at a dizzying pace in the last couple of years. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=809.16s)]
*  President Obama started the thaw in the relationship by reestablishing diplomatic relations and [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=814.24s)]
*  easing restrictions on travel. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=819.92s)]
*  Now President-elect Trump is threatening to undo all those moves. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=822.24s)]
*  And Fidel Castro, who spent 50 years poking his thumb in the eye of every American president, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=826.32s)]
*  has died. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=832.0s)]
*  Whatever happens, there's already a war underway that has the U.S. and Cuba on the rocks. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=833.48s)]
*  It's a war over rum, specifically over two different versions of Havana Club rum. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=839.6800000000001s)]
*  And it's as bitter as the Cold War ever was. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=845.88s)]
*  It's a Tuesday afternoon at El Floridita in Old Havana, and we and lots of other visitors [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=853.24s)]

*  How many bottles do you go through a day? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=871.48s)]
*  So it's between 60 and 80 bottles per day. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=873.48s)]
*  That's a lot of Daiquiri. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=877.48s)]
*  Yeah, plenty of 80 bottles. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=879.48s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=880.48s)]
*  Is this just from today? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=881.72s)]
*  Yeah, today, yeah. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=884.72s)]
*  All those bottles were filled with Havana Club rum, produced by a 50-50 joint venture [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=886.44s)]
*  between the Cuban government and the French beverage giant Pernod Ricard, which sent Jerome [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=892.12s)]

*  We met him in a place that's rarely open to outsiders, a warehouse stacked to the ceiling [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=902.96s)]
*  with oak barrels full of rum. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=908.88s)]
*  We built a very great success with Havana Club. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=911.5999999999999s)]
*  When we started the partnership in 1993, we sold five million bottles a year. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=915.28s)]
*  Today we sell 50 million bottles a year. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=921.4799999999999s)]
*  Fifty million bottles, 11 million of them sold here in Cuba. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=924.4399999999999s)]
*  The tourists drinking Havana Club are obvious. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=928.9599999999999s)]
*  But we went looking down the side streets and found locals drinking it too, at Domino [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=931.76s)]
*  Games and dance halls and discos, and sipping it along Havana's seafront promenade, the [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=937.64s)]
*  Malecón. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=944.64s)]
*  To distill and age all that rum, the Cuban government and Pernod Ricard rely on Azbel [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=947.0s)]
*  Morales, Havana Club's master rum maker. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=952.88s)]
*  He loves talking about rum, but he says to really understand it, you have to drink it. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=956.4799999999999s)]
*  The first sip will impact you the most, he said, and make you anxious for a second. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=968.4799999999999s)]
*  I am anxious to continue the second sip. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=976.4s)]
*  And the third and the fourth. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=980.1199999999999s)]
*  You don't have anything else to do today, do we? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=982.1199999999999s)]
*  And the Cujiba cigar that he says pairs perfectly with this Havana Club. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=985.1999999999999s)]
*  As we drank and smoked, Morales told me Cubans are born with a rum gene. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=990.56s)]
*  And to be real Havana Club rum, he said, it must be made from Cuban sugarcane and aged [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=996.6s)]
*  in the hot and sticky Cuban climate. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1003.32s)]
*  Here's where it gets confusing. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1006.6s)]
*  This is another bottle of Havana Club rum. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1008.48s)]
*  Exact same name, but you can see right here, this one is made in Puerto Rico, and it's [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1011.5600000000001s)]
*  made by Bacardi. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1016.6s)]
*  How in the world can you say Havana Club when you're making it in Puerto Rico? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1019.1600000000001s)]
*  The way that you say, I'm calling it Arizona, I'm not making it in Arizona. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1026.04s)]
*  Rick Wilson is an executive at Bacardi, originally a Cuban company, and now the largest privately [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1031.6399999999999s)]
*  held liquor business in the world. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1037.82s)]
*  The true Havana Club made with the recipe of the original founders is the Havana Club [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1040.3999999999999s)]
*  that Bacardi is making and selling here in the United States. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1046.08s)]
*  Bacardi bought that original recipe from the family of this woman, Emparo Oretchabala. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1049.8s)]
*  And it was one of the wealthiest families in Cuba before the revolution. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1055.52s)]
*  Yes, definitely. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1059.8s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1060.8s)]
*  The Oretchabala fortune was built on sugar and shipping and rum, Havana Club rum. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1061.8s)]
*  Like hundreds of other Cuban companies, theirs was confiscated shortly after Fidel Castro's [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1069.0s)]
*  revolution in 1959. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1074.26s)]
*  They took over the company on December 31, 1959. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1077.36s)]
*  Do you remember that day? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1084.48s)]
*  I remember that day vividly. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1085.48s)]
*  My husband came home. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1088.04s)]
*  He went to work early and then he came home and he says, they've thrown us out. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1091.04s)]
*  It's over. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1097.64s)]
*  It's over, he said. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1098.64s)]
*  He said it's over. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1100.28s)]
*  All of their assets gone, Emparo and her husband Ramon were ordered to leave Cuba with only [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1102.3200000000002s)]
*  the clothes on their backs. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1107.52s)]
*  And how much money did you have in your pockets? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1109.24s)]
*  Absolutely nothing. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1111.8s)]
*  Nothing, nothing, nothing. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1114.1599999999999s)]
*  What was it like when you got on the plane? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1116.1599999999999s)]
*  Everybody on the entire plane was crying. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1118.48s)]
*  And I remember I look out the window as we were taking off and I say to my husband, take [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1122.44s)]
*  a good look because you're not going to see it again. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1129.2s)]
*  In Cuba, the Oretchabalas and Bacardi had been competitors, each making and selling [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1132.9199999999998s)]
*  popular brands of rum. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1138.24s)]
*  But when the revolution came, Rick Wilson says Bacardi had an advantage. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1140.04s)]
*  Bacardi, unlike most other Cuban families and companies, had assets outside of Cuba. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1145.16s)]
*  Is that the reason they were able to survive? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1152.16s)]
*  Yes, because we could continue to produce and sell our product. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1154.28s)]
*  Unlike the Oretchabalas. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1159.6000000000001s)]
*  The Oretchabalas, everything they had was in Cuba, everything. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1161.28s)]
*  Except the recipe for Havana Club rum. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1166.72s)]
*  The Oretchabalas eventually sold it to their old rival Bacardi, which makes this version [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1169.8s)]
*  at its distillery in Puerto Rico. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1175.08s)]
*  They did it to compete with this version made by the Cuban government and their partner, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1177.6799999999998s)]
*  Prano Ricard. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1182.6s)]
*  That set off the longest bar fight ever. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1184.08s)]
*  It has been fought both in the courts, where the latest lawsuit is pending, and the marketplace [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1187.6799999999998s)]
*  between two of the world's largest liquor companies. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1193.6000000000001s)]
*  Prano Ricard produces Absolut Vodka, Chivas Regal Scotch, Beefeater Gin. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1197.16s)]
*  Bacardi makes Grey Goose Vodka, Dewar's Scotch and Bombay Sapphire Gin. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1202.96s)]
*  And now they both make Havana Club Rum, and they both try to claim the moral high ground. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1208.8400000000001s)]
*  And it wasn't that Prano Ricard had just stepped up and they looked to be a competitor to you? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1215.1200000000001s)]
*  No, I mean, we don't mind competition from Prano Ricard or anyone else. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1220.24s)]
*  Prano Ricard, though, did and is partnering with the Cuban government, who has confiscated [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1225.24s)]
*  the assets of a family. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1232.6399999999999s)]
*  No compensation paid. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1234.6s)]
*  It's hard to believe that a company like Bacardi is just making a moral argument. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1236.36s)]
*  We're not. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1241.28s)]
*  We're making a moral and a legal argument. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1242.28s)]
*  And the legal argument is? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1246.28s)]
*  Theft. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1248.52s)]
*  I mean, it comes down, it's stolen property. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1249.52s)]
*  That's what it comes down to. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1252.12s)]
*  The Bacardi family will say that this Havana Club is stolen property. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1253.8s)]
*  Well, you see the place. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1259.6399999999999s)]
*  We are here in our distillery. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1262.16s)]
*  It was built in 2007. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1263.58s)]
*  And none of these facilities were used before the revolution? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1266.6399999999999s)]
*  None of these facilities were used before the revolution, no. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1271.04s)]
*  And as Belmoralis dismisses the argument that the Havana Club rum he produces for Prano [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1274.68s)]
*  Ricard in Cuba is not the real thing because it's not made from the original Arechibala [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1279.82s)]
*  family recipe. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1285.34s)]
*  The recipe remains in this land, he said. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1290.16s)]
*  It is here in this climate, the culture. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1293.16s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1295.88s)]
*  To make a Cuban rum, you need to make it in Cuba. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1298.4s)]
*  It doesn't take more than that. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1301.04s)]
*  You cannot make Cuban rum in Puerto Rico. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1303.82s)]
*  And the Arechibala's cannot, he insists, claim to own the Havana Club brand decades after [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1306.34s)]
*  abandoning it. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1312.06s)]
*  How do you feel that they use that word about the family saying they abandoned the brand? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1313.06s)]
*  They can say whatever they want. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1318.62s)]
*  They can say that we abandoned. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1321.62s)]
*  We didn't abandon anything. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1324.02s)]
*  They threw us out. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1326.1799999999998s)]
*  The Castro government did that. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1328.02s)]
*  The French company Prano Ricard came along much later and turned the Cuban Havana Club [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1330.16s)]
*  into a global brand and an icon of Cuban culture. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1335.72s)]
*  We found the logo everywhere we went in Cuba, on every glass and every bar, on taxi drivers [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1341.02s)]
*  and parking attendants, on the chairs we did our interviews in and at the tourist market, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1346.8200000000002s)]
*  on artwork and tote bags and t-shirts right alongside other symbols of Cuba. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1352.1200000000001s)]
*  Do you sell more che t-shirts or more Havana Club t-shirts? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1357.66s)]
*  The same. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1360.96s)]
*  About the same? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1361.96s)]
*  When we sell a bottle of Havana Club in France, in England or in Chile, we not only sell the [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1362.96s)]

*  right to use the Havana Club name. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1452.04s)]

*  People use these wonderful words to describe taste. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1645.2s)]
*  There's personality. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1648.48s)]
*  What else? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1649.56s)]
*  The elegance. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1650.56s)]
*  The wine has to be elegant. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1651.56s)]
*  And so you say, how do you describe elegance? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1652.56s)]
*  You can't. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1655.0s)]
*  It's like an elegant woman. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1656.0s)]
*  How do you describe her? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1657.0s)]
*  It's personal. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1658.52s)]

*  Antonori is perhaps the oldest family business on earth. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1669.96s)]
*  The first document which we have, which proves that an ancestor of mine was involved in the [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1674.08s)]
*  wine production dates back to 1385. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1680.8s)]
*  The patriarch and still the godfather is Piero Antonori. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1684.36s)]
*  He's 70 and bears the noble title of Marchesa. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1689.36s)]
*  He works behind an antique desk that dates to the Renaissance. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1693.36s)]
*  When we have to take some decision regarding the family, we have them here. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1697.6799999999998s)]
*  And my father used to do the same thing. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1702.6399999999999s)]
*  And in his birthplace, Florence, the city that gave birth to the Renaissance, that flowering [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1705.1599999999999s)]
*  of art, science and the good life, he leads a visitor to a small window to the past. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1710.96s)]
*  It looks like a confessional. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1718.08s)]
*  Hundreds of years ago, an Antonori cellar master sat waiting for customers to knock. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1721.6000000000001s)]
*  The cellar master would pass a bottle of Chianti wine and it would receive the money back. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1727.8400000000001s)]
*  This has been in operation until a couple of centuries ago. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1738.12s)]
*  Recent history by your standard. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1744.0s)]
*  For 623 years, various Antonori have kept the business going despite war, plague, political [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1747.3999999999999s)]
*  intrigue and the shifting tastes of consumers. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1755.04s)]
*  The family tree shows a bumper crop of Antonori who made their mark, not just in wine, but [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1758.96s)]
*  in every aspect of Italian life. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1765.3999999999999s)]
*  In business, in politics, in church. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1768.96s)]
*  So the family always made sure back then that all bets were covered, correct? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1770.96s)]
*  I think it was a bit the concept, yes. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1776.08s)]
*  There were poets and priests, rogues and rascals. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1779.28s)]
*  In 1576, Francesco de' Medici, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, had one Antonori strangled for [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1782.92s)]
*  his undue attentions to Bianca, the Duke's wife. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1790.76s)]
*  In the 1700s, another Antonori cultivated Pope Clement XII as an important customer. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1795.08s)]
*  The Pontiff, who commissioned the building of Rome's Trevi Fountain, decided to throw [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1802.48s)]
*  a few coins the Antonori's way. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1807.36s)]
*  We have some correspondence saying that the Pope used to like very much the wines of our [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1810.44s)]
*  family and he wanted to order more. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1817.04s)]
*  Pretty good recommendation, correct? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1820.2s)]
*  Especially in the 18th century. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1822.0s)]
*  Yes, no doubt. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1823.6399999999999s)]
*  In the 18th century, one of the most important figures in the family history lining the shelves [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1825.96s)]
*  of the Marchesa's office says precious little about the wives and daughters in the Antonori [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1831.8s)]
*  family tree, a fact not lost on Albiara, Allegra and Alesia. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1837.8s)]
*  Are there any interesting women in those 26 generations? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1843.92s)]
*  I'm sure there are some women, but women in history in the past time even if, unless they [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1847.92s)]
*  were six to be mentioned. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1852.96s)]
*  It's true because when I went to agriculture university in northern Italy, Milan, we were [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1854.56s)]
*  two women and the rest were all men, very lucky. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1861.08s)]
*  For six centuries, command of the Antonori Empire was passed from father to son. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1865.0s)]
*  But with no male heir, the Marchesa, some years ago, sold a major stake in the business [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1870.6000000000001s)]
*  to Whitbread, a British company whose fortune was based on beer making. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1876.56s)]
*  It was the period when I didn't know exactly if my daughters would be interested or not [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1881.84s)]
*  to be involved in the business. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1889.0s)]
*  And so for me, that was a way to guarantee a continuity also to the company. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1891.72s)]
*  But the partnership produced mainly grapes of wrath. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1897.52s)]
*  It was a vintage clash between the foaming suds of quick profits and Piero insisting [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1901.08s)]
*  he'd sell no wine before its time. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1907.3999999999999s)]
*  This marriage of inconvenience ended when Piero bought back the shares, keeping Antonori [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1911.28s)]
*  all in the family. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1918.04s)]
*  I think he saw us interested and said, why not? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1919.52s)]
*  What's wrong with girls? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1924.8s)]
*  And so took his chance expecting his daughters to fall in love with the business. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1925.8s)]
*  And that they did. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1932.72s)]
*  Now, all three travel the countryside and the world, helping to grow, promote and market [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1933.72s)]
*  Antonori wines. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1939.8s)]
*  They sold 17 million bottles last year, $200 million worth, making a healthy profit. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1941.48s)]
*  And though the business now involves spreadsheets and science, the basics still come as they [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1949.12s)]
*  have for centuries from down on the farm. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1954.44s)]
*  Even with all this tradition and history and everything else, the family still regards [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1957.9199999999998s)]
*  itself as farmers, yes? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1962.24s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1965.12s)]
*  This is our origin still now. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1966.92s)]
*  In modern times, we are basically farmers. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1969.2s)]
*  We appreciate the nature and the countryside more than the glamorous city life. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1972.8400000000001s)]
*  Your three country bumpkins. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1978.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1980.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1981.44s)]
*  Well, hardly. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1982.44s)]
*  Salud. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1983.44s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1984.44s)]
*  Elegance is the rule at Palazzo Antonori, the family home in Florence. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1985.44s)]
*  Since the family's wines must be sampled often to ensure quality control, every lunch at [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1990.0800000000002s)]
*  Palazzo is a kind of business lunch. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=1996.44s)]
*  The Marchesa, his wife Francesca, their daughters and sons-in-law, and the grandchildren all [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2000.0s)]
*  may have a say. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2006.16s)]
*  Any family arguments at this table? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2007.52s)]
*  Come on, secrets. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2009.88s)]
*  I want secrets revealed here. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2011.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2015.0800000000002s)]
*  Sometimes we start with an argument, but after three or four glasses of wine... [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2016.0800000000002s)]
*  Everything disappears. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2020.3200000000002s)]
*  This palazzo has been in the family since 1506, both the headquarter of the business [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2023.52s)]
*  and also the residence of the family. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2031.6399999999999s)]
*  When an Antonori wishes to seek solace or a place for quiet contemplation or even a [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2034.48s)]
*  place to confess his earthly sins, it's hardly difficult. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2040.08s)]
*  Just leave the Palazzo Antonori and traffic notwithstanding, cross the Piazza Antonori. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2043.8799999999999s)]
*  And within minutes arrive at the Capella Antonori, the Antonori family chapel, where [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2052.24s)]
*  they might visit the tomb of Alessandro Antonori, one of the founders of the dynasty, and perhaps [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2059.72s)]
*  a nod to any number of Antonoris buried beneath the chapel floor. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2065.9599999999996s)]
*  If wealth and history can buy one lasting pleasure, it is convenience. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2071.52s)]
*  Marchesa Antonori, for instance, commutes by air to his most famous vineyard, Tignanello, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2079.76s)]
*  in the Tuscan countryside south of Florence. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2086.0800000000004s)]
*  Here the family develop the red wines for which they're famous. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2089.32s)]
*  At his villa here, this is the view the Marchesa wakes up to every morning. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2093.2000000000003s)]
*  We have the vineyards and the landscape. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2098.94s)]
*  But as the experience with the British partners showed, it's no business for the impatient [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2101.0400000000004s)]
*  or for those who have a taste for the quick buck. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2107.3599999999997s)]
*  Ten years can pass from the time a new vine is planted until its wine comes to market. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2110.92s)]
*  You have to be patient and to wait until the wine is good enough. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2116.92s)]
*  The vines are old enough to produce a good wine. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2121.64s)]
*  Tignanello is but one of the Antonori postcard perfect estates. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2125.2s)]
*  Castella della Sala is another, halfway between Rome and Florence. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2130.3199999999997s)]
*  Here, Albiara went to work after high school, living at the family's grand 14th century [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2136.08s)]
*  castle, but learning the wine trade from the bottom up as a field hand in the vineyards. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2141.56s)]
*  You got your hands dirty. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2147.8s)]
*  Yes, I got my hands dirty. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2149.36s)]
*  It was the first place where I really started to understand what was going on in the whole [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2151.3s)]
*  process. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2156.76s)]
*  But it's not all dirt and business. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2157.76s)]
*  Here's that other estate, Guadalajara Taso, on the Tuscan coast. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2161.8s)]
*  I did my own stable, my own training track in the middle of the vineyards. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2166.84s)]
*  I go riding there every morning. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2174.6800000000003s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2176.2400000000002s)]
*  I love it. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2177.2400000000002s)]
*  It's a very good life you describe. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2178.2400000000002s)]
*  Are you spoiled? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2180.04s)]
*  Yes, I am very spoiled. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2182.0s)]
*  But I think we appreciate what we have. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2184.8s)]
*  And they're constantly reminded that in this line of work, nature always has the last word. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2188.64s)]
*  The Antonori found the 2002 crop wasn't up to par and didn't bother bottling most of [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2194.72s)]
*  it. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2201.16s)]
*  You cannot force things. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2202.16s)]
*  You cannot force nature if you have a bad vintage. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2203.16s)]
*  Tough luck. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2206.96s)]
*  We can wake it up for a second before we put it back to sleep. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2208.72s)]
*  Every few months, they check on the progress of their wine. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2213.54s)]
*  Fast asleep in the cellars. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2216.96s)]
*  The verdict? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2225.92s)]
*  Let it sleep a while longer. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2227.48s)]
*  You see it's still very young, very rough. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2229.32s)]
*  It has to stay in there for a little while. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2231.32s)]
*  Another family meal, another bottle of wine or two. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2236.8s)]
*  Every once in a while, someone offers to buy them out. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2241.2400000000002s)]
*  But this farmer and his daughters politely decline. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2244.66s)]
*  On the theory that if family ownership was good enough in 1385, it's good enough today. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2247.74s)]
*  It is really our intention to remain a family business because we think that this is the [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2255.94s)]
*  best solution for us. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2264.66s)]
*  For at least another 500 years. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2266.94s)]
*  At least. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2271.06s)]
*  What are the signs of global warming? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2272.06s)]
*  Glaciers are melting at an increasingly rapid pace. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2285.86s)]
*  Persistent droughts are spreading. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2289.42s)]
*  Well, we have another to tell you about. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2291.1s)]
*  Wine. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2294.06s)]
*  As in what you probably cracked open for Christmas dinner. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2295.24s)]
*  The grapes have seen the effects of climate change in the soil, in the roots of the vines [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2300.2s)]
*  and the yields of their crops. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2306.0s)]
*  France, a major center of wine making for centuries, is experiencing increasingly higher [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2308.08s)]
*  temperatures and extreme weather conditions that have damaged vintages and livelihoods. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2314.26s)]
*  This year was particularly dramatic. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2321.08s)]
*  France recorded its smallest harvest since 1957 and stands to lose more than two billion [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2324.04s)]
*  dollars in sales, a huge blow to the country's second largest export industry. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2330.68s)]
*  And it's hitting nearly all the wine growing regions where they make dry whites, fruity [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2337.48s)]
*  reds and fizzy champagne. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2342.52s)]
*  All bubblies are called sparkling wine. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2347.44s)]
*  But champagne is made here and nowhere else in these vineyards and villages of Champagne, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2350.52s)]
*  located in northeastern France. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2357.4s)]
*  There's a mystique to champagne, an aura of romance. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2360.08s)]
*  Coco Chanel once said, I only drink champagne on two occasions, when I'm in love and when [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2364.72s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2371.0s)]
*  They've been producing this wine of kings here for centuries. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2373.04s)]
*  So how long has this winemaking business and the vineyards been in your family? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2377.22s)]
*  From 1700. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2384.8199999999997s)]
*  1700? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2386.8199999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2387.8199999999997s)]
*  Christine Seviano took over the family business and its 20 acres of vines 14 years ago. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2388.8199999999997s)]
*  She's the 10th generation. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2395.54s)]
*  This is the cellar of my grandfather. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2397.58s)]
*  After surviving the French Revolution and two world wars, her family's house of Pio [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2400.94s)]
*  Seviano faced its worst year ever in 2021. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2406.62s)]
*  We lost 90 percent of our harvest. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2411.9s)]
*  90 percent? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2415.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2417.3s)]
*  How many bottles were you able to produce this year, as opposed to a normal year? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2418.3s)]
*  A normal year, I produce around 40,000, 50,000 bottles. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2425.42s)]
*  Zero this year? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2430.82s)]
*  Zero. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2431.82s)]
*  It's the first time in the history of my winery that we will not make champagne. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2432.82s)]
*  Not a single bottle from this winery? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2439.7400000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2442.7400000000002s)]
*  Higher temperatures and extreme weather episodes devastated not only her harvest, but much [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2443.7400000000002s)]
*  of champagne's. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2449.9s)]
*  It rained in two or three days that it rained normally in one month. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2451.6200000000003s)]
*  Even my father told me that in his career he has never seen that. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2457.14s)]
*  Almost flood-like? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2462.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2463.18s)]
*  The worst of it, she says, came in June and July, when the heat and the rains resulted [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2464.18s)]
*  in a more crippling outbreak than usual of funguses, like mildew contamination. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2470.14s)]
*  In fact, when the grapes are contaminated, the fruit is drying and after we can use it [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2476.94s)]
*  because there is no juice, nothing. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2484.5s)]
*  And you attribute this to climate change? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2486.82s)]
*  Yes, because it was so extreme, it's not normal. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2489.42s)]
*  This year's extreme weather not only battered champagne and the foundation of its economy, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2494.3s)]
*  but nearly every one of the wine-producing regions in France, Burgundy to Bordeaux, where [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2500.1800000000003s)]
*  some of the highest quality, best known and best tasting reds and whites are made. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2506.1800000000003s)]
*  And these are what grape? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2512.9s)]
*  This is Merlot. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2514.1000000000004s)]
*  Merlot. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2515.1000000000004s)]
*  Merlot. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2516.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2517.38s)]
*  I love Merlot. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2518.38s)]
*  Merlot makes beautiful, soft, rounded wines. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2519.38s)]
*  Jacques Lerton, the head of a wine family dynasty, runs the Chateau La Louvière and [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2521.5s)]
*  several other wineries in Bordeaux. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2527.2999999999997s)]
*  He says vine disease is getting worse all over France because of the rising temperatures. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2530.38s)]
*  We don't have winters anymore, almost. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2536.3399999999997s)]
*  In wintertime, normally you get colder conditions. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2539.94s)]
*  These cool conditions tend to kill the funguses or the disease. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2544.82s)]
*  So normally, winter cleans the situation, you see. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2549.62s)]
*  But the most important problem that we have is what we call spring frost. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2553.62s)]
*  Spring frost was so severe in April this year that wine growers were on their knees lighting [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2559.7000000000003s)]
*  bales of hay and candles between their vines in a mostly futile attempt to protect their [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2565.68s)]
*  young buds. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2571.7999999999997s)]
*  It is the largest catastrophe we have ever suffered because before we had some spring [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2572.7999999999997s)]
*  frost in some regions, but this is the first time we have it all over France. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2578.56s)]
*  Now due to the fact that we don't have these very strong winters, the buds start to open [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2585.12s)]
*  and then expose themselves to this series of spring frosts that we have. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2591.7599999999998s)]
*  And that is the crux of the problem. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2596.92s)]
*  And that disease what affects the most the quantity of grapes. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2598.36s)]
*  So tell us about this year in terms of the amount. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2603.64s)]
*  In average, in France this year, a loss of 30%. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2607.96s)]
*  30% of the yields. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2612.52s)]
*  And what about you? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2615.72s)]
*  What's your percentage? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2616.72s)]
*  And us, we have been affected up to 40%. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2617.72s)]
*  So you're one of the largest wine producers in Bordeaux. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2621.04s)]
*  40% loss, I mean that's enormous. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2624.72s)]
*  It's huge. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2628.44s)]
*  It's huge. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2629.44s)]
*  For Bordeaux, he estimates a loss of roughly $800 million in sales this year. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2630.44s)]
*  Is this something that's happening all over Europe or just France? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2637.24s)]
*  No, it's happening all over Europe definitely. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2641.2799999999997s)]
*  Greg Jones is a research climatologist with Southern Oregon University who for 25 years [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2644.04s)]
*  has specialized in the study of how climate influences the growing and harvesting of wine [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2650.72s)]
*  grapes. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2656.72s)]
*  What we're seeing today is we're seeing more of these extreme events happening more frequently [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2657.72s)]
*  at greater degrees and causing more problems. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2662.12s)]
*  Yeah, we see it everywhere. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2664.56s)]
*  It's not just in farm regions. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2665.9599999999996s)]
*  I mean every part of our country is experiencing some extreme weather condition. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2667.56s)]
*  So how do you know it isn't that normal extreme weather as opposed to a general climate change? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2673.4s)]
*  There's an area in climate science called attribution science. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2681.6800000000003s)]
*  And attribution science is all about trying to kind of understand how much role humans [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2684.88s)]
*  have in the game of climate. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2690.76s)]
*  So the idea of- [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2693.4s)]
*  Oh, who to attribute it to. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2694.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2695.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2696.4s)]
*  And so what climatologists do is we develop models that look at aspects of climate and [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2697.4s)]
*  those models that are coming out are really telling us more and more that in the absence [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2701.96s)]
*  of humans, most of these things would not occur to the same degree they're occurring [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2707.4s)]
*  today. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2711.28s)]
*  Tie what you're saying about climate to what's going on in France now. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2712.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2716.08s)]
*  In France, just like most of Europe, temperatures have gone up, summers have gotten drier, and [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2717.08s)]
*  wine grapes are just sensitive. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2722.08s)]
*  They're sensitive to those kind of changes and we've been seeing it worldwide and Europe [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2723.84s)]
*  has been at the epicenter of it. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2729.0s)]
*  This weather map of Europe for June 2021, the second warmest June in Europe on record, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2731.18s)]
*  shows a red band depicting high surface air temperatures stretching across much of the [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2738.1s)]
*  continent. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2744.4199999999996s)]
*  Heat waves were also recorded over Western North America in June 2021. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2745.98s)]
*  Scorching temperatures and drought conditions contributed to wildfires in 2020 around Napa [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2752.8599999999997s)]
*  and Sonoma, the center of America's wine industry, where fields were left blackened. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2759.7799999999997s)]
*  In Australia, the bushfires of 2019 and 20 burnt some vineyards to the ground while smoke [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2766.94s)]
*  ruined the quality of the grapes. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2774.18s)]
*  In 2017, in Italy, spring frost combined with hailstorms and a heat wave known as Lucifer [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2777.1s)]
*  led to the lowest harvest in decades. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2785.02s)]
*  Particularly hard hit was northern and central Italy, where Prosecco, Barolo and Chianti [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2788.02s)]
*  are made. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2794.38s)]
*  And in parts of Chile and Argentina, higher temperatures are pushing wine growers to plant [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2796.1s)]
*  their vineyards at higher altitudes where temperatures are cooler. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2801.54s)]
*  Greg Jones says the warming atmosphere is also changing the grapes' growth cycle. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2806.14s)]
*  It accelerates that ripening to the point that we're picking earlier. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2811.62s)]
*  For example, 2020 in Burgundy, the picking date was August 20th. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2815.46s)]
*  And prior to that, we've been averaging for the last 30 years about September 15th. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2820.66s)]
*  And then for 600 years before that, we were averaging the end of September 1st of October. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2826.3s)]
*  So it's dramatic. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2832.18s)]
*  So it's pretty dramatic. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2833.66s)]
*  These pages of parchment documenting harvest dates going back as far as 1354 were found [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2835.46s)]
*  in the Church of Notre Dame in Burgundy. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2842.26s)]
*  1354. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2845.06s)]
*  It's a wonderful data record that we've been able to look at to better understand what [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2846.06s)]
*  climates were like back then, how it affected harvests and what that looks like today. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2851.14s)]
*  I'm smiling because I'm thinking 1300s. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2855.1s)]
*  I'm thinking the monks were making wine. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2857.34s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2860.58s)]
*  The wine industry in France is so vital to the economy that the government has scientists [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2861.94s)]
*  studying ways to adapt and mitigate the changing environment. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2867.38s)]
*  One route to adaptation is to introduce new grape varieties. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2872.74s)]
*  Experimental vineyards have been planted with vines from warmer climate countries to see [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2878.54s)]
*  if they can grow here so the grapes can be blended in with the Merlot's, Cabernet's, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2883.2999999999997s)]
*  and other French wines. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2889.14s)]
*  Nathalie Ola is the director of the project at the Bordeaux Science Institute of Vine [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2891.22s)]
*  and Wine. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2896.8999999999996s)]
*  So you're looking at grapes that come from southern regions that maybe grow better in [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2898.22s)]
*  warmer climates. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2904.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2905.16s)]
*  Like from where? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2906.16s)]
*  From Spain, from Portugal, from Greece. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2907.2599999999998s)]
*  How many are you actually looking at? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2911.02s)]
*  So in this experimental vineyard we are studying 52 different varieties. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2912.8599999999997s)]
*  They've chosen six of those varieties thus far to be planted in Bordeaux. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2918.2999999999997s)]
*  So this is your greenhouse? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2923.66s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2925.1s)]
*  A second route of adaptation is genetic breeding. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2926.7799999999997s)]
*  Are you actually creating new grapes, new different kinds of grapes? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2930.3799999999997s)]
*  Yes, the idea is to have grapes, new varieties, which can be resistant to disease and also [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2934.8599999999997s)]

*  At the Institute's laboratory, scientists are studying the genetics of wine's color, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2952.66s)]
*  aroma, and taste. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2958.42s)]
*  And that's what you're trying to preserve even as you introduce new grapes. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2960.42s)]
*  Yes, I think we want to change without changing, I would say. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2963.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2968.94s)]
*  How confident are you that you're going to crack the puzzle, you're going to figure out [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2969.94s)]
*  how to stay ahead of climate change? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2975.46s)]
*  All together, with new varieties, new growing practice, I think we can cope with climate [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2977.78s)]
*  change at least until the middle of the 21th century. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2987.7400000000002s)]
*  The middle of the century is only 30 years from now. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2993.02s)]
*  So you're looking at how fast temperatures are rising and you're saying it's possible [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=2997.1000000000004s)]
*  that they will rise above a point where you can't? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3002.6200000000003s)]
*  It will be much more complicated to keep what we call Bordeaux style and Bordeaux taste. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3007.2999999999997s)]
*  With all the gloom and doom about warming temperatures in wine country, there's actually [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3014.62s)]
*  a surprising upside. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3020.2599999999998s)]
*  What about quality? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3022.66s)]
*  What about the taste? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3025.14s)]
*  What's important about wine? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3027.54s)]
*  How is climate change affecting that? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3028.8399999999997s)]
*  The climate change is affecting the quality very positively. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3031.8599999999997s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3037.1s)]
*  We have never seen such a large quantity of good vintages of Bordeaux wines. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3039.46s)]
*  Well explain that. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3046.18s)]
*  That's counterintuitive. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3047.58s)]
*  Thanks to the global warming and the climate change, now we have warmer summers, which [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3048.58s)]
*  makes our grapes ripening better. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3055.62s)]
*  If we get good warm conditions, we have good color quantity in the skin, but as well, we [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3058.38s)]
*  have the right amount of sugar. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3066.34s)]
*  What a painful irony. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3069.02s)]
*  The taste improves just as the yields are shrinking for winemakers like Christine Saviano. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3071.1000000000004s)]
*  So more quality but fewer grapes, dramatically fewer grapes. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3077.7000000000003s)]
*  Yes, it's crazy. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3081.7000000000003s)]
*  If you have another year like this one, financially can you survive? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3083.6200000000003s)]
*  It will be difficult, really, really difficult. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3091.34s)]
*  But in the same time, I'm trustful for next year. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3094.98s)]
*  I mean, I try, I'm trustful. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3099.18s)]
*  I have to. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3102.66s)]
*  Improved taste is not the only unforeseen benefit of climate change for some winemakers. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3105.3s)]
*  How it's affecting the bubbly you're likely to enjoy on New Year's Eve when we return. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3111.16s)]
*  For some wine growers, climate change has been a disaster, as we've seen. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3116.42s)]
*  But as it turns out, climate change has been a boon for others. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3130.02s)]
*  While higher temperatures have hurt growers in France and Italy, for instance, places [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3134.3s)]
*  that historically have been too cold to produce quality wines are now turning out consistently [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3139.38s)]
*  good ones. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3145.5s)]
*  Places like England. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3147.18s)]
*  The notion that in England the only beverage is lukewarm ale at the pub is woefully outdated. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3149.32s)]
*  Today a new industry has taken root. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3157.9s)]
*  Healthy vineyards in England are producing some of the world's best wines. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3160.98s)]
*  This sprawling vineyard with acres and acres of wine grapes ready for harvest is located [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3165.78s)]
*  in Kent, 40 miles outside of London. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3171.68s)]
*  It didn't exist 15 years ago, but Great Britain's wine producing fortunes have been heating [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3176.64s)]
*  up along with the planet. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3182.2799999999997s)]
*  So how has climate change affected the grapes, the wine in this region? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3184.7999999999997s)]
*  Stephen Skelton, a member of the highly respected Institute of Masters of Wine, is a viticulturist, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3192.0s)]
*  an expert in the science, production and business of wine grapes. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3198.6s)]
*  I never heard of really good English wine. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3203.2799999999997s)]
*  It was very, very rare until we realized that you could grow these classic French champagne [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3206.08s)]
*  varieties in our climate. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3211.52s)]
*  This is what they grow in champagne. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3213.58s)]
*  And they now grow very, very successfully here in the UK. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3215.64s)]
*  What used to be a minute cottage industry run by retirees and gentlemen farmers is today [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3220.54s)]
*  one of the fastest wine growing regions in the world. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3227.0s)]
*  This is quite an operation going on. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3231.8399999999997s)]
*  It's a big winery. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3233.52s)]
*  In 2018, the vintage in England was so bountiful that some vineyards had to scramble to buy [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3235.72s)]
*  vats and tanks to hold it all. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3242.12s)]
*  Others simply threw grapes away. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3245.44s)]
*  By the end of the decade, winemakers here will produce an estimated 20 million bottles [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3248.04s)]
*  a year. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3253.48s)]
*  The foundation of today's industry is the fact that we can grow these varieties which [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3254.6s)]
*  we couldn't grow earlier. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3259.08s)]
*  So why couldn't you do it before? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3261.32s)]
*  Because the climate was too cold. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3263.32s)]
*  You just had to get the temperature up. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3265.2400000000002s)]
*  So does global warming mean that England now has more days for the grapes to ripen? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3267.2s)]
*  Yeah, because we have more days over 85, 86 degrees Fahrenheit. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3274.0s)]
*  We are in the UK now. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3279.4s)]
*  We're now where champagne was 30 or 40 years ago. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3280.6s)]
*  The climate has shifted in 30 or 40 years upwards, northwards. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3283.92s)]
*  So the climate right now where you and I are sitting in England is the same as the climate [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3288.8s)]
*  was 40 years ago in Champagne. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3295.2400000000002s)]
*  He traces the birth of the industry here to 1988. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3299.12s)]
*  Then there came two Americans, the Mosses, Stuart and Sandy Moss. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3302.6400000000003s)]
*  They bought an estate called Night Simba, which is very well known today, and they were [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3308.28s)]
*  the first people to plant a big commercial vineyard. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3312.12s)]
*  What did you think? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3315.6s)]
*  I thought they were bonkers. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3317.2s)]
*  I have to say, yeah, I thought they were nuts. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3318.56s)]
*  I'd heard they were rich Americans up in the hills. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3321.04s)]
*  He had a fortune from apparently from the dental business. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3325.3199999999997s)]
*  And I thought they were mad. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3329.52s)]
*  Their first wine took a long while to mature. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3330.72s)]
*  It was four years in the making before it was tasted. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3333.56s)]
*  And then it won this major prize. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3337.68s)]
*  Right away, four years? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3339.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3341.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3342.32s)]
*  And the second year, the next year, they won an even bigger prize. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3343.32s)]
*  Are you thinking that in a couple of years, the English sparkling wine will be actually [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3345.6400000000003s)]
*  better than what they're growing in Champagne? [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3352.1600000000003s)]
*  As they produce 300 million bottles a year. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3354.8s)]
*  The best is still very, very good. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3356.48s)]
*  The best is superb. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3358.28s)]
*  But you could line up the best 10 English sparkling wines against the best 10 Champagnes [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3360.28s)]
*  at the same sort of price category. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3365.44s)]
*  I can guarantee you that English wines would be in the top half. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3367.28s)]
*  To prove his point, he gave us a taste, opening a 10-year-old bottle. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3371.6800000000003s)]

*  Oh, no pop. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3379.0800000000004s)]
*  No pop. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3380.44s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3381.44s)]
*  The longer sparkling wine ages, he says, the better. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3382.44s)]
*  And what you look for is the spritz of fizz on the palate. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3385.1600000000003s)]
*  You see you've got the bubbles coming from there. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3389.76s)]
*  And that's a good thing. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3392.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3393.0400000000004s)]

*  And then you nose it. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3395.0400000000004s)]
*  You get a nice yeasty character. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3396.8s)]

*  Mmm. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3401.84s)]

*  Have you brought the grapes from France? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3447.08s)]
*  Yeah, the vines were imported from France as tiny little vines. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3449.2s)]
*  And the first crop we had from them was in 2020. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3454.88s)]
*  And then that wine will be released at the end of 2024. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3457.88s)]
*  You know, in France, part of the problem is not just warming. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3461.96s)]
*  It's extreme weather conditions. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3467.0s)]
*  You know, too much flooding, too much frost, too hot. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3469.16s)]
*  Won't England also have extreme situations like that? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3473.3599999999997s)]
*  Not at the moment. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3477.12s)]
*  We're fortunate. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3478.12s)]
*  You know, England is coming onto the radar as being an area that is warming, but it's [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3479.12s)]
*  still moderate in terms of heat compared to South and Central Europe, where it's becoming [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3483.3199999999997s)]
*  very, very hot. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3488.6s)]
*  Do you think that wine lovers around the world already know that great wines are coming out [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3489.88s)]
*  of England? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3498.08s)]
*  In other words, is it ooh la la, no more, it's jolly good? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3499.08s)]
*  I think it's still, we're still at the sort of in the starting block. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3505.48s)]
*  But certainly, yes, over the last 10 years, from a small base, the sales of English have [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3512.04s)]
*  been growing substantially. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3516.88s)]
*  Tattinger's aim is to produce 300,000 bottles a year by 2025. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3519.32s)]
*  Overall, the English wine industry had $220 million in sales last year. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3524.92s)]
*  The idea of first-rate English wine would have been laughed at 20 years ago. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3533.16s)]
*  But a similar migration has happened on the west coast of the United States, where excellent [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3539.16s)]
*  and increasingly popular Pinot and Chardonnay grapes are now found 560 miles north of Napa [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3544.52s)]
*  in Willamette Valley, Oregon. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3552.48s)]
*  In the 1950s and 60s, there were really almost no grapes grown in Oregon. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3554.72s)]
*  And that was because the climates were too cold. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3560.06s)]
*  And so if you fast forward to where we are today, we're just in a different world. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3562.48s)]
*  Greg Jones, a wine climatologist at Southern Oregon University, says grapes are now growing [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3566.0s)]
*  in even more unexpected places. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3572.7200000000003s)]
*  We have wineries today in Norway, in Quebec, in British Columbia, in Tasmania, and the [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3575.6800000000003s)]
*  South Islands of Chile. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3581.76s)]
*  Tasmanian wine. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3583.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Tasmania has really been burgeoning as really a great wine producing region in [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3584.7200000000003s)]
*  Australia. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3590.4s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3591.48s)]
*  Tasmania is south of Australia. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3592.48s)]
*  So as winemaking goes north in the northern hemisphere, are you saying it's going south [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3594.92s)]
*  in the southern hemisphere? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3601.36s)]
*  It's going further poleward in both hemispheres, in parts of southern Argentina and Chile, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3603.1600000000003s)]
*  and many parts of northern Europe have started growing grapes. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3610.28s)]
*  In real time. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3614.84s)]
*  In real time. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3615.84s)]
*  So if you really want a very vivid now example of what's happening due to climate change, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3617.28s)]
*  go look at wine. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3624.28s)]
*  Yeah, you can. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3625.28s)]
*  People are experimenting at northerly latitudes that I'm amazed that in my career I didn't [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3626.28s)]
*  think I would see it. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3632.76s)]
*  In the United Kingdom, as a measure of its acceptance, English sparkling wine has had [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3634.0s)]
*  the royal imprimatur, the queen, serving it at Buckingham Palace. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3638.8s)]
*  And it was poured at the recent climate change summit in Scotland. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3644.64s)]
*  Master of wine Stephen Skelton is bullish on the future. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3648.96s)]
*  If global warming is intensifying, how worried are you and the other English vinters that [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3653.12s)]
*  it's going to move north beyond your ability to grow grapes? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3660.7999999999997s)]
*  No, I'm not worried at all. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3664.4s)]
*  No, I mean the next 40 years are going to be fascinating, I think, because we're just [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3665.4s)]
*  on the cusp of it being really commercial. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3669.16s)]
*  Field levels are not quite where we want them yet. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3672.24s)]
*  You know, we would like a little bit more heat. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3675.2s)]
*  You might get it. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3678.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3679.68s)]
*  But eventually. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3680.68s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3681.68s)]
*  We'll have to start growing oranges and bananas. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3682.68s)]
*  I mean, it's a serious question. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3686.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3688.2799999999997s)]
*  Personally, I think we will cope with what's being thrown at us. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3689.2799999999997s)]
*  Some of the winemakers we met are benefiting. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3692.4399999999996s)]
*  Some are suffering. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3695.4399999999996s)]
*  But all are seeing firsthand the message that climate change is delivering. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3696.92s)]
*  Wine grapes have often been called the canary in the coal mine. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3702.76s)]
*  Climatologist Greg Jones says that's been true since the first wine was made in 6000 [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3705.8s)]
*  B.C. in Eastern Europe and then spread to ancient Egypt, Greece and Persia. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3711.04s)]
*  Kings celebrated their victories with wine, and the Christian world put it at the heart [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3718.04s)]
*  of the Eucharist. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3722.76s)]
*  Wine history, Jones says, is human history. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3724.88s)]
*  Wine touches society in some pretty powerful ways. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3728.6s)]
*  It's related to civilizations. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3732.6400000000003s)]
*  It's related to history. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3734.6800000000003s)]
*  It's related to geography. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3735.88s)]
*  It's related to romanticism, art, gastronomy, biology, chemistry. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3737.4s)]
*  So there's so many things that are tied to it that it becomes something that we can tell [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3743.32s)]
*  the story of climate change through wine pretty easily. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3748.2000000000003s)]
*  If you want to start a spirited debate at your next holiday meal, ask your guests which [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3754.88s)]
*  country invented wine. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3764.52s)]
*  France, Italy, or Greece might come to mind. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3766.44s)]
*  But most scholars say Georgia, the small, former Soviet republic, is the birthplace [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3770.04s)]
*  of wine. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3775.12s)]
*  Scientists say wine residue found on pieces of pottery in Georgia dates back 8,000 years. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3776.96s)]
*  The country of nearly 4 million shares a border with Russia and has survived thousands [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3783.72s)]
*  of years of invasions and wars. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3788.72s)]
*  Multiple dynasties have come and gone, but somehow many Georgian grapes survived. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3791.72s)]
*  Tonight we'll take you on a journey through Georgia to meet the promoters and protectors [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3797.7999999999997s)]
*  of Georgia's ancient vines. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3803.52s)]
*  When you first set foot in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, she's hard to miss. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3807.7599999999998s)]
*  Perched high up over the city, the towering mother of Georgia wields a sword in her right [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3812.52s)]
*  hand to fend off her enemies and a bowl of wine in her left to welcome friends. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3817.32s)]
*  That welcome and the country's deep history of winemaking winds through Georgia. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3825.6s)]
*  The vines of city dwellers cling to tiny balconies. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3831.72s)]
*  Small family vineyards stretch along the countryside. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3835.76s)]
*  Larger producers export millions of bottles globally. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3840.64s)]
*  But to fully understand the rich history of wine in Georgia, we went to the fertile river [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3845.0s)]
*  valley of Kiketi to see the Aliverdi Monastery. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3851.3199999999997s)]
*  At the foot of the Caucasus Mountains, the monastery looks like a fortress. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3857.04s)]
*  We were invited inside its walls. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3862.08s)]
*  Our host was Georgian Orthodox Bishop David. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3865.7999999999997s)]
*  He oversees three monks who live on the grounds of the medieval compound. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3871.2799999999997s)]
*  It is a quiet life, committed to God and the godly pursuit of creating a perfect glass of wine. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3875.4s)]
*  How many bottles of wine do you make here a year? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3885.3199999999997s)]
*  20,000 bottles with a maximum of 50,000 bottles. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3889.44s)]
*  Our wine seller's capacity is 30 tons of wine. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3893.8799999999997s)]
*  Four monks, 20,000 bottles. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3898.6s)]
*  This is a lot of work. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3901.56s)]
*  Do they ever sleep? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3902.56s)]
*  We sleep and work at the same time. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3905.08s)]
*  Locals help work the land. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3910.04s)]
*  But for centuries, the monks have been the guardians of these ancient vines. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3912.3199999999997s)]
*  The monastery dates back to the sixth century. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3917.2799999999997s)]
*  Bishop David told us vines were planted on day one. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3920.4s)]
*  Does making wine make you feel closer to God? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3924.84s)]
*  Of course. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3930.84s)]
*  Whenever we are in the vineyard or the wine cellar, we always feel that God is close to us. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3931.84s)]
*  Grapes have long held a sacred place in Georgia. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3939.1600000000003s)]
*  In ancient times, wine was considered a divine drink and offered to the gods to win favor. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3942.44s)]
*  Georgian soldiers tied a piece of grapevine inside the chest of their uniforms to protect [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3949.68s)]
*  them and to assure that if they died in battle, a vine would sprout from their heart. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3954.56s)]
*  Man was mortal, but Georgian vines eternal. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3961.2799999999997s)]
*  For centuries, the Georgian monks have made wine the same way, producing reds, whites, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3964.96s)]
*  and even ambers. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3970.8799999999997s)]

*  The process is uniquely Georgian. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3975.18s)]
*  Under the monastery, buried six feet deep in the ground, giant clay pots called quevery [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3977.9s)]

*  It is the traditional way to make wine in Georgia. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3989.38s)]
*  Many homes have queveries in their cellar. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3992.6600000000003s)]
*  But today, there are only a handful of quevery makers who carry on the tradition of hand-building [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=3994.94s)]
*  these clay beasts. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4001.86s)]

*  Press grapes, skins, stalks, and the juice are all mixed into the quevery, which is buried [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4008.44s)]

*  On this day, a haunting chant stirred inside the cathedral dome. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4054.06s)]
*  The chant, called You Are the Vineyard, was written 900 years ago by a former king-turned-monk [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4059.98s)]

*  And how does the wine taste? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4111.88s)]
*  Not to talk about taste. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4114.96s)]
*  It's better to taste it ourselves. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4116.42s)]
*  Sitting near the ancient queveries, the bishop opened a bottle. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4121.36s)]
*  When tasting the queverie wine for the first time, a person might think they are trying [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4127.88s)]
*  something very different. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4133.28s)]
*  Ooh, it does look golden. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4134.88s)]
*  Amber of a... [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4136.88s)]
*  Look at that color. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4137.88s)]

*  That's what we have to be thankful to God. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4147.42s)]
*  There's much to be thankful to God about in this glass. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4151.08s)]
*  Of course, it could not be any other way. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4156.74s)]

*  How much is wine a part of the story of this country? [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4180.14s)]
*  This is the question, wine or food, or food or wine. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4184.02s)]
*  It's so together because we don't imagine our everyday life without the wine. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4188.02s)]
*  And the wine, it's one of the most important parts in our history and our culture and [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4194.06s)]
*  in food also. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4201.740000000001s)]

*  While pursuing a psychology degree in New York, she was working at a restaurant and [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4207.22s)]
*  fell in love with both the chef and cooking. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4211.360000000001s)]
*  She dropped the psych degree and the chef and enrolled in culinary school in Manhattan. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4214.280000000001s)]
*  A master chef, Takuna is now known as the godmother of Georgia's culinary evolution. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4220.46s)]
*  She runs the popular Cafe Latera in the capital of Tbilisi, a restaurant known for its adventuresome [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4226.58s)]
*  menu and wine pairings. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4232.76s)]
*  You're credited with revolutionizing Georgian cuisine. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4235.02s)]
*  How have Georgians responded to that? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4238.74s)]
*  I just started to experiment and then I started to do new recipes based on the traditional [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4241.34s)]
*  ones and then give this choice to people. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4249.7s)]
*  And in the beginning it was big resistance. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4253.98s)]
*  The people think you have to keep tradition and untouched. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4256.139999999999s)]
*  But for me, tradition is always innovation because every dish was somehow innovative [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4261.0599999999995s)]
*  when it started. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4267.66s)]
*  Georgia sits at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4269.78s)]
*  A Georgian dinner can look and taste like a trip around the world. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4272.58s)]
*  All these influences starting from China, even from America to Europe, you know, it's [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4277.3s)]
*  gathered here. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4282.74s)]
*  It was a hub. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4283.74s)]
*  And that's why our cuisine, traditional cuisine, it was always fusion. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4285.7s)]
*  Georgia was fusion before fusion was fusion. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4291.860000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4294.06s)]
*  And also because so many invasions and we were always under the rule of different countries. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4295.06s)]
*  And this brought these different tastes and the spices and also cooking methods. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4301.1s)]
*  This is all yours. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4307.5s)]
*  Oh gosh. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4309.22s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4310.22s)]
*  Culinary clashes are my favorite kind of conflicts to cover. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4311.22s)]
*  I reported for duty at the dinner table. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4314.700000000001s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4317.34s)]
*  Yes, it's beautiful. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4318.34s)]
*  This is our first dish, like appetizer. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4320.22s)]
*  It's called palis, the vegetables with walnuts. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4323.54s)]
*  We cook in Georgia lots with the walnuts. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4328.7s)]
*  Walnuts are one of the workhorses of Georgian cuisine, pulverized and used the same way [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4332.86s)]
*  the French use butter to make everything creamier. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4337.62s)]
*  Not surprisingly, grape leaves are also a favorite ingredient. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4341.78s)]
*  This is tolma and you can't imagine any table without this dish. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4346.0599999999995s)]
*  Our dinner included five courses with six dishes, each with a different glass of wine. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4351.94s)]
*  We have this like a filet mignon. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4357.26s)]
*  Do you have a couch that I can recline on? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4359.54s)]
*  Yes. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4361.54s)]
*  Chef Takuna insisted we taste everything because the wines came from different regions and [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4362.54s)]
*  each had its own unique flavor. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4368.14s)]
*  We have so many great winemakers, you know, and it is like a new revolution, you know, [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4370.7s)]
*  and not losing the old traditions. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4376.18s)]
*  They improve it and then continue doing the great wines. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4379.2s)]
*  But there is no wine more distinctly Georgian than this. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4383.02s)]
*  You see the difference of the colors? [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4386.86s)]
*  Look at the colors. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4388.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4389.46s)]
*  That's why it's called amber. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4390.46s)]
*  Not orange? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4391.46s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4392.46s)]
*  Never orange. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4393.46s)]
*  No. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4394.46s)]
*  Americans know what to do with red wine, we know what to do with white wine, but if you [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4395.46s)]
*  put an amber wine out, I would not know what I should be serving that way. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4398.62s)]
*  Actually this is what's very interesting. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4405.0199999999995s)]
*  Amber wine, it's like a universal wine. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4408.78s)]
*  You can drink with the vegetables, you can drink with meat, but this is what makes it [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4411.94s)]
*  unique, you know. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4418.179999999999s)]
*  You can pair almost with everything. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4419.259999999999s)]
*  At the first of all. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4422.139999999999s)]
*  So I noticed you said you don't like to eat when you're cooking, but you will have a sip, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4423.139999999999s)]
*  right? [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4430.98s)]
*  But I drink. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4431.98s)]
*  Fine, then you can stay. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4432.98s)]
*  Two hours later, the warmth of Georgian hospitality, where perhaps all that wine washed over us. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4437.7s)]
*  It's like a Georgian saying that the guests are from the gods, so you have to treat the [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4444.58s)]
*  guests like you treat the gods. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4450.7s)]
*  We usually hear about guests from hell, but guests from the gods sounds a lot better. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4453.5199999999995s)]
*  In Georgia, we got guests really from the gods. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4458.26s)]
*  Cheers. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4463.58s)]
*  When we come back, you'll meet a guest who came to Georgia for the culture, food, and [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4466.98s)]
*  wine 25 years ago and never left. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4471.379999999999s)]
*  Today, he's credited with helping to put Georgian wines on the map and menus around the world. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4474.58s)]
*  When most of us order wine, we look for a favorite variety, consider the region, the [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4488.82s)]
*  age, or perhaps the cost. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4493.58s)]
*  But ordering a glass of wine from Georgia can be a bit more complicated. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4496.4s)]
*  The former Soviet Bloc nation is the size of West Virginia, but offers more than 40 [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4501.0s)]
*  varieties of wine, each with a tongue-twisting name from vines centuries old. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4506.2s)]
*  Still, Georgian wine is gaining popularity beyond the country's borders. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4511.679999999999s)]
*  Last year, nearly a million and a half bottles of it were shipped to the United States, an [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4517.12s)]
*  increase of nearly 30% from the previous year. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4521.759999999999s)]
*  We headed to Georgia's wine country to get a taste for ourselves. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4525.86s)]
*  Stretched along eastern Georgia, more than 4,000 square miles of vineyards sit at the [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4531.259999999999s)]
*  base of its mountains like a welcome mat. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4536.82s)]
*  This is the Keketi region. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4540.179999999999s)]
*  Three-quarters of the grapes used to make wine in Georgia are grown here. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4542.62s)]
*  In the middle of one of Keketi's hundreds of vineyards, we met an unlikely ambassador [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4547.799999999999s)]
*  of Georgian wine, an American, 47-year-old John Werdeman. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4552.94s)]
*  How does an American end up with all of this? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4558.139999999999s)]
*  Well, it started with a curiosity for a country that the more I learned about it, the more [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4561.82s)]
*  fascinating it was, and nobody seemed to know anything about it, at least in my world. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4567.94s)]
*  Werdeman grew up a world away in Santa Fe, New Mexico. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4573.46s)]
*  He was studying art in Russia when he visited neighboring Georgia. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4577.219999999999s)]
*  He liked it so much, he moved here and in 2006 bought a 62-acre rundown vineyard, hired [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4581.16s)]
*  locals and started Pheasants Tears Winery. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4587.92s)]
*  Georgia is the birthplace of wine. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4592.4s)]
*  The mild climate and rich soil have made it an ideal place to grow hundreds of varieties [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4594.88s)]
*  of grapes for thousands of years. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4599.92s)]
*  At one time, the country reportedly had more than 1,400 indigenous grape varieties. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4602.599999999999s)]
*  Varieties were wiped out during the Soviet era when quantity replaced diversity. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4608.76s)]
*  John Werdeman is part of a national effort to re-cultivate Georgia's ancient vines and [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4614.12s)]
*  bring them back to life. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4619.400000000001s)]
*  So in Soviet times, out of 525 varieties, you had roughly four or five that were the [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4621.2s)]
*  main ones that were commercially available. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4626.84s)]
*  So what happened to the rest? [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4628.88s)]
*  Luckily, Georgians were still growing them in their backyard. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4630.92s)]
*  They were allowed to have small private plots for their own personal use and they kept the [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4633.96s)]
*  ancestral varieties going. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4638.28s)]
*  So when we wanted to start to bring back these ancient varieties together with our friends, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4640.4s)]
*  that was where we were going. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4646.84s)]
*  We were going to the individual backyards of farmers that kept growing the varieties [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4647.84s)]
*  that their grandfathers and great-grandfathers had kept alive. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4652.639999999999s)]
*  Clawing back all of the grape varieties is something Georgians take seriously. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4656.84s)]
*  A kind of declaration of independence from their former Soviet rulers. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4661.679999999999s)]
*  In 2014, the Georgian government opened two research centers to locate, study and grow [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4666.88s)]
*  those rare grape vines. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4672.5199999999995s)]
*  Scientists head into the vineyards once a week to gather critical data. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4675.759999999999s)]
*  DNA of grape leaves is analyzed. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4679.24s)]
*  Juice is extracted in the field and then tested in labs for disease. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4682.92s)]
*  Healthy vines are replanted. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4688.08s)]
*  Today, there are more than 500 native grape varieties growing in Georgia. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4689.759999999999s)]
*  At Pheasant's Tears, ancient Georgian methods are used to make the wine. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4695.84s)]
*  Stems, skins and juice are all mixed together, then poured in giant queveries buried deep [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4700.84s)]
*  underground and sealed with clay where the mixture ferments and ages. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4708.04s)]
*  This is our lower quevery level. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4713.68s)]
*  Is all the wine here made in queveries? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4717.0s)]
*  Most all of it. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4720.04s)]
*  We have a couple of wines we'll be tasting later that are on the fresher, lighter side [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4721.08s)]
*  from Western Georgia that we use stainless steel but everything of structure. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4724.84s)]
*  So based on where they are, they have a different taste? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4728.56s)]
*  Yeah, if they're in a space that breathes versus a reductive space. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4732.36s)]
*  The wine typically remains inside the queveries for nine months. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4737.88s)]
*  This is where we age the wines. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4742.08s)]
*  Then it's bottled and stored in a cellar. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4744.32s)]
*  So where are these bottles from? [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4747.4s)]
*  These are from the last 15 years. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4749.42s)]
*  It allows us to understand how the wines develop and what is the most ideal time for releasing. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4751.06s)]
*  Nothing is rushed in Georgia, something we witnessed during lunchtime at the vineyard. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4759.22s)]
*  For the harvest of 2023, may it be healthy and long living. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4764.7s)]
*  Workers were celebrating the harvest with a traditional Georgian feast called a supra, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4770.54s)]
*  a lavish meal typically held after weddings, funerals, baptisms and births. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4775.42s)]
*  During our lunch, guests broke into song. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4782.7s)]
*  This is a traditional Georgian folk song, centuries old. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4789.42s)]
*  A few guests started dancing. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4802.22s)]
*  Lunch hour stretched into dinner. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4805.42s)]
*  And then came the toasts. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4815.66s)]
*  For children and for the children that are continuing the tradition. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4818.9400000000005s)]
*  A half dozen of them before dessert. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4823.26s)]
*  With so many toasts, so many songs and dancing, it's amazing anybody eats. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4829.18s)]
*  Yeah, but the supras last for quite a long time. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4833.9800000000005s)]
*  If workers go out to work for a few hours in the field and they come back together, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4837.660000000001s)]
*  they'll have a supra and they'll have toasts about the things that mean the most to them in life. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4842.3s)]
*  For Georgian winemaking, for the grapes, the history, the vessel, the varieties [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4847.9800000000005s)]
*  and the songs that were built around the feast. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4854.22s)]
*  Some people have called the Georgian supra an academy where basically people come together [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4856.9400000000005s)]
*  in order to share what they know and to learn from one another. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4862.14s)]
*  But John Werdeman says schooling the rest of the world on Georgian wines hasn't been so easy. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4866.780000000001s)]
*  First, there are at least 40 varieties of Georgian wines being served around the world. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4873.740000000001s)]
*  And even the most sophisticated sommelier might struggle to just pronounce them. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4879.18s)]
*  Saperavi, Casatelli and Mitsvani don't exactly roll off the tongue. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4884.860000000001s)]
*  Then there's the issue of that unusual color, the giant ginger elephant in the glass. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4891.18s)]
*  I've noticed a couple people we've spoken to here when you say orange wine, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4897.5s)]
*  they shudder a little bit and say it's amber. Is there any difference? [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4901.34s)]
*  No, in terms of modern wines and texts, they're synonyms. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4906.7s)]
*  But I was also a little bit part of the early conversations where [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4911.02s)]
*  when we were talking about orange wine from Georgia, people worried is this some sort of [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4915.18s)]
*  citrus concoction being sold outside of Atlanta? What is it that creates that beautiful color? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4919.18s)]
*  So you're basically leaving the must or the juice of the grapes with skins, the pips and [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4927.1s)]
*  sometimes the stems, basically extracting both pigment as well as phenolic structure [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4933.42s)]
*  from the skins. That's changing the flavor as well as the color. But it's also, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4939.66s)]
*  a lot of our preconceptions can affect how we perceive the wine. Because if you were to show [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4945.18s)]
*  them that same wine in a black glass, they might say, what a delightfully refreshing light red. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4951.02s)]
*  But when they see it from a white grape, they think, is this somehow a bit clumsy or rustic [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4957.42s)]
*  or why, you know, this doesn't taste like my Sauvignon Blanc that I'm used to drinking. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4963.5s)]
*  A little frustrating. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4968.14s)]
*  A friend of mine who's a master of wine in London has a beautiful saying [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4969.660000000001s)]
*  that she gave at a conference once. She said, the orange or amber wines of Georgia [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4973.5s)]
*  are not the mean sisters of whites, but the introspective cousins of reds. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4980.540000000001s)]
*  But over the last decade, the Georgian family of wines, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4986.22s)]
*  reds, whites and even ambers have been embraced around the globe. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4989.740000000001s)]
*  Last year, Georgia exported over 140 million bottles of wine to more than 65 countries. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=4994.54s)]
*  What do you attribute to that kind of growth? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5002.94s)]
*  I think in the very beginning, we were walking around with maps and photographs and saying that [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5006.14s)]
*  no, we're not, you know, swarthy versions of Russians, but Georgians have their own language, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5012.46s)]
*  their own wine culture, their own culinary culture, history that is very ancient and, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5018.3s)]
*  you know, try the wines. But it took a fair amount of effort [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5024.06s)]
*  to get people to give us the benefit of the doubt and even to try. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5027.740000000001s)]
*  Over the past decade, more than 2000 new vineyards have taken root in the country. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5031.34s)]
*  And last year, Georgian winemakers made more than a hundred million dollars. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5036.62s)]
*  All of a sudden, it's like watching a black and white picture of a rainbow come to color again. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5041.820000000001s)]
*  This diversity and expanse of color is coming back to the Georgian table [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5047.42s)]
*  after sleeping for almost a few centuries. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5052.78s)]
*  For Georgians, it's another reason to celebrate. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5058.3s)]
*  For the rest of the world, it's a chance to taste history. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5061.58s)]
*  17 years ago, 60 Minutes first examined the so-called French paradox, which suggested that the [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5077.26s)]
*  French, despite a high-fat diet and high consumption of wine, had a remarkably low [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5084.06s)]
*  incidence of heart disease compared with Americans. Most researchers agreed that there was something [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5089.58s)]
*  in the wine that offered protection. And a few years later, even the highly cautious [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5095.58s)]
*  Federal Dietary Guidelines say that moderate consumption of red wine can be beneficial. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5101.5s)]
*  Now, scientists across the country have identified a substance in red wine called resveratrol that [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5108.06s)]
*  they believe might do more than just protect the heart, but could, in very high concentrations, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5114.7s)]
*  significantly extend life by preventing a number of age-related illnesses. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5120.54s)]
*  If they're right, we all may soon be taking a pill that could give us an extra decade or two [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5125.660000000001s)]
*  of healthy old age. If the promise holds true, I think this has the chance to change health care. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5132.22s)]
*  Dr. Christoph Westphal says we all may soon be taking a drug that just might beat the clock, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5139.660000000001s)]
*  a simple pill that could delay the inevitable. Our goal is to prevent and forestall many of [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5146.54s)]
*  the diseases that strike us as we reach 50, 60, and 70, all with one pill. What you're suggesting [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5152.78s)]
*  is that it's some kind of rejuvenation drug that turns a 70-year-old into a 35-year-old. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5158.3s)]
*  That might be pretty hard to do, but I think if we're on a train heading one direction, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5164.0599999999995s)]
*  we can slow down that train. I think we can slow down these genes that control the aging process. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5168.54s)]
*  That quest to put death on hold began in 2003 when Westphal met David Sinclair, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5175.660000000001s)]
*  a biochemist at Harvard who was studying the genetic components of aging. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5182.700000000001s)]
*  Five years ago, I met David, and he had shown that you could extend lifespan in yeast. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5187.820000000001s)]
*  That's pretty exciting. If you happen to be a yeast, it's very exciting. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5193.660000000001s)]
*  Yeasts are one thing. Human beings are more complicated. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5197.660000000001s)]
*  So Sinclair focused on a gene present in almost all life forms, the sirtuin gene. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5201.900000000001s)]
*  It's normally inactive, but when it is active, Sinclair believes it triggers a survival mechanism [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5208.14s)]
*  that extends life. Convinced that something in nature could activate that gene, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5215.26s)]
*  Sinclair randomly tested thousands of compounds. And bingo, he got a hit, resveratrol. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5220.780000000001s)]
*  When I googled this resveratrol, I was shocked to find that red wine was the top hit. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5228.700000000001s)]
*  Red wine is brimming with resveratrol. It's found in high concentration in the skin of the grape [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5235.02s)]
*  and seems to play a role in protecting it from invading bacteria and fungi. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5241.18s)]
*  Were you aware of the research into red wine that had offered certain health benefits? [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5246.700000000001s)]
*  Oh, sure. I mean, that's why I almost fell off my chair when the link was made. And I thought that [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5251.740000000001s)]
*  this was a potential explanation for the benefits of red wine. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5256.86s)]
*  Convinced they were on the verge of a major scientific breakthrough, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5260.94s)]
*  Sinclair and Westfall launched Sirtrus, a Cambridge, Massachusetts research company. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5264.46s)]
*  They, along with a handful of other cutting edge biotech companies, are developing resveratrol-based [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5270.78s)]
*  drugs that they believe zero in on the longevity gene. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5277.42s)]
*  The important news here is not that we found something in red wine. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5281.9s)]
*  The important thing is that we passed a milestone where we can now make drugs based on this [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5286.3s)]
*  knowledge and potentially slow down aging itself. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5290.38s)]
*  Everyone from plastic surgeons to your friendly snake oil salesman [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5293.42s)]
*  have been promising a ticket to eternal youth for some time. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5297.5s)]
*  So the prospect of a prescription pill based on red wine that could trigger a longevity gene [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5301.099999999999s)]
*  sounds too good to be true. And yet, scientists have actually known for years of one surefire [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5307.58s)]
*  way of doing that. Stay hungry. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5313.66s)]
*  Eating a lot of food turns that off. Dieting, extreme dieting, turns it on. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5317.18s)]
*  These rhesus monkeys are on a major diet. For nearly two decades now, they've been taking in [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5324.22s)]
*  a good 30% fewer calories than their well-fed brothers and sisters. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5330.7s)]
*  It's feeding time, I gather. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5335.66s)]
*  They're the centerpiece of a national institutes of health study at the University of Wisconsin, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5337.66s)]
*  on whether or not CR, calorie restriction, makes them healthier and extends their lives. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5343.66s)]
*  To maintain their sterile environment, we had to suit up to visit them with Ricky Coleman, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5350.46s)]
*  the project leader. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5355.98s)]
*  These are two of our control animals here? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5357.34s)]
*  They are nearing the end of a typical monkey lifespan, about 27 years, and major differences [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5360.22s)]
*  in their overall health are becoming clear. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5367.18s)]
*  The difference is really obvious. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5370.0599999999995s)]
*  The skinny monkeys actually look younger, their coats are shinier, and fewer have arthritis. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5372.62s)]
*  And those chunky monkeys, many have diabetes, and a significantly higher number of cancer [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5378.86s)]
*  and heart disease. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5385.82s)]
*  Pound for pound, the lighter guys do much better. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5387.099999999999s)]
*  Dr. Richard Weidruck, who heads up the study, believes that calorie restriction turns on [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5391.419999999999s)]
*  these monkeys' genetic survival switch. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5397.82s)]
*  A hungry life seems to lead to a longer life. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5400.62s)]
*  There is an emerging survival advantage for the monkeys on caloric restriction, and 50% [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5404.94s)]
*  of the normally fed animals have died, and maybe 25% of those on caloric restriction. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5411.82s)]
*  That's a pretty remarkable number. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5418.54s)]
*  Surely those are strong indications that restricted calorie intake among humans would be [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5420.94s)]
*  extremely beneficial. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5427.02s)]
*  It appears to support that idea. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5428.540000000001s)]
*  But our record as humans in staying on diets is pretty miserable. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5431.5s)]
*  And worsening. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5438.3s)]
*  So it's a fat chance that we'll all be giving up our passion for greasy junk. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5439.740000000001s)]
*  We consume tons more calories than we need. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5444.860000000001s)]
*  But believe it or not, there are some Americans who just revel in their hunger. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5448.38s)]
*  I basically just had one meal a day. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5454.3s)]
*  Meet the Skinnies, members of CRS, the Calorie Restriction Society, a group that's been [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5456.86s)]
*  severely restricting their calories for years now. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5463.34s)]
*  They're also part of a Washington University study to see if humans mimic the monkeys. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5466.9400000000005s)]
*  Does this kind of self-denial make them live longer, healthier lives? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5473.34s)]
*  We join them for what they call Happy Hour. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5478.86s)]
*  So this is in the spirit of a Bloody Mary. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5482.46s)]
*  Though you might regard it as an unhappy hour. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5485.1s)]
*  A cocktail of low-calorie soup for starters and walnuts and baby food. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5488.06s)]
*  Green bean puree on flour-free bread to top off this feast fit for a flea. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5493.820000000001s)]
*  If I'm hungry, I know, number one, that I have done what I'm meant to do. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5501.42s)]
*  I've eaten less than my body thought it wanted. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5505.660000000001s)]
*  So far, the participants have lowered their blood pressure, reduced body fat, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5509.1s)]
*  and lessened risk factors for heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5513.66s)]
*  And what's more, to one husband anyway, starvation has its sexy side. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5518.78s)]
*  To be honest, if you saw her without any clothes, she looked pretty darn good, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5525.099999999999s)]
*  like a woman of many, many years younger. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5530.139999999999s)]
*  Their emissaries travel the world, spreading the faith and the word. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5534.0599999999995s)]
*  Hunger turns on the survival gene. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5539.099999999999s)]
*  I would like to live to be 100. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5541.82s)]
*  The skinnies may not die young, but given their diet, they just might die of boredom. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5546.299999999999s)]
*  But if the scientists and searchers are on the right track, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5552.0599999999995s)]
*  it could mean forget dieting, forget the sweaty business of working out. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5555.5s)]
*  Just pop a pill and you are in guilt-free couch potato paradise. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5560.94s)]
*  We have a pill that can mimic many of the effects of calorie restriction or exercise. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5566.54s)]
*  So one could be very healthy and obese at the same time. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5571.82s)]
*  Our goal is healthy individuals, ideally via lifestyle, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5575.099999999999s)]
*  and if that doesn't work, we believe that we'll have a pill that can mimic that. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5580.38s)]
*  A pill that in effect diets for you. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5584.139999999999s)]
*  A pill that turns on the survival gene. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5587.099999999999s)]
*  What we're trying to do with our drugs here is to put the body in a defensive state, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5590.54s)]
*  to ring the alarm bells and get the body to defend itself. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5595.26s)]
*  Instead of dieting, to set the alarm off, pop a pill. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5598.46s)]
*  The pill is a highly concentrated form of resveratrol, a virtual vineyard of healthy living. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5601.98s)]
*  How much red wine would you have to drink to get the kind of resveratrol that you're using? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5609.18s)]
*  The sad news is that you'd need to drink about a thousand bottles a day of red wine, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5615.0199999999995s)]
*  which I don't recommend. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5619.34s)]
*  The pill itself may not extend lifespan, but could prevent the diseases of aging, [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5621.18s)]
*  Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, even cancer. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5626.86s)]
*  What we're talking about is activating the body's natural genetic defenses against diseases, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5631.66s)]
*  and that's very powerful if we can harness that. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5637.34s)]
*  Resveratrol has been tested on mice and the results have been encouraging. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5639.82s)]
*  In this test video provided by Cirteris, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5644.3s)]
*  both of the mice have been fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5647.5s)]
*  But when placed on a treadmill, the mouse on the right ran twice as far. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5651.9s)]
*  He was taking high concentrations of resveratrol. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5657.26s)]
*  You have fat mice and you have fat mice with resveratrol, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5661.66s)]
*  and the ones that are on resveratrol, they can run twice as far [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5665.42s)]
*  and they live longer, about 20% longer. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5669.0199999999995s)]
*  Other studies showed that among mice fed a high-fat diet, [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5671.9s)]
*  those given resveratrol didn't gain as much weight as those not given the drug. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5676.139999999999s)]
*  Sinclair believes that resveratrol actually changes the physiology of the mice. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5682.139999999999s)]
*  The proof, he says, is in the postmortem. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5687.42s)]
*  Their organs looked pristine, youthful, fat-free, [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5690.860000000001s)]
*  and their physiology was just like they were dieting, but they were fat. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5695.74s)]
*  Convinced they were on the right path, they fast-tracked the drug into human trials [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5699.34s)]
*  on people with untreated diabetes, and the results were impressive. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5704.78s)]
*  It significantly lowered glucose and insulin levels [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5709.58s)]
*  without the patients changing their diet or taking any other drugs. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5713.18s)]
*  Originally, our hope was that you'd be able to prevent diseases of aging. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5718.62s)]
*  What we ended up seeing is actually you could therapeutically intervene [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5723.259999999999s)]
*  in patients who have diseases of aging, and that was unexpected. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5726.94s)]
*  Yeah, the diabetic patients have high blood sugar [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5730.299999999999s)]
*  and the molecules bring it down. That's treatment, that's not prevention. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5732.78s)]
*  Certress is now developing what they say is a much more potent, [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5736.459999999999s)]
*  synthetic version of resveratrol that will also soon go into human trials. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5740.7s)]
*  This time on cancer patients. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5746.14s)]
*  I keep on thinking, you know, what used to seem like it was science fiction. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5749.18s)]
*  I actually believe the biology is right, and if we're right, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5753.42s)]
*  this may be the most important thing that we're going to do in our lives. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5756.06s)]
*  Possibly, but it is important to remember that 9 out of 10 drugs [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5759.34s)]
*  that look good in mice ultimately fail in human trials. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5763.58s)]
*  Still, the speed and results generated by certress and the resveratrol drugs are unusual. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5768.06s)]
*  And Sinclair believes these drugs will not only keep people living longer, [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5775.26s)]
*  but will keep them healthy longer. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5779.58s)]
*  What we're talking about is potentially making a 90-year-old as healthy as a 60-year-old. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5782.3s)]
*  A 90-year-old can play tennis and see their great grandkids graduate from college. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5787.58s)]
*  People will live active, healthy lives and then die quietly in their sleep, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5792.9400000000005s)]
*  and that's really the aim here with these medicines. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5796.62s)]
*  Are we on the edge of maintaining active lives into our hundreds, for example? [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5798.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, we've certainly passed a corner in terms of the science, [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5804.78s)]
*  and someone's going to achieve it. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5808.7s)]
*  And if it's not us, it's going to be someone else. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5810.54s)]
*  But the question that most of us want answered is, when do we get this pill? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5813.0199999999995s)]
*  I would say five years to be conservative, that this will happen within our lifetimes. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5818.46s)]
*  I'm fairly certain about that. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5823.5s)]
*  One measure of the potential of this research, Dr. Sinclair and Dr. Westfall's little startup [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5826.7s)]
*  company, was recently bought by the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5832.46s)]
*  for almost three-quarters of a billion dollars. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5838.3s)]
*  We were nearing last call on the grandest of British institutions, the pub. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5851.66s)]
*  After enduring for hundreds of years as centers for schmoozing and boozing, [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5856.54s)]
*  pubs were going the way of morning newspapers, afternoon tea, and the whole idea of empire. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5860.62s)]
*  A range of factors undercut the kind of neighborhood joint where everyone knows your name. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5866.46s)]
*  Then came COVID, which kept most British pubs closed for more than a year. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5871.66s)]
*  But in the summer of 2021, the UK reopened, and not unlike an over-served patron, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5876.22s)]
*  the pub story started to stagger and lurch in an unexpected direction. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5882.3s)]
*  And as we first reported last year, maybe it's not quite closing time after all. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5886.38s)]
*  1200 plus years old. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5892.7s)]
*  A man walks into a pub. Of course he does. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5894.46s)]
*  In this case, it's a very old pub. Ye olde Fighting Cox in St Albans, outside London. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5897.82s)]
*  Its landlord, or publican, is Christo Toffoli. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5905.02s)]
*  So your pub is one of dozens in this country that claims to be the oldest ever. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5908.78s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5913.82s)]
*  Make your case. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5914.38s)]
*  It turns out there's a bit of a misconception which one is the oldest and what the oldest pub is. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5915.820000000001s)]
*  So we're the oldest pub. The first brick was laid in 793, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5920.14s)]
*  and the oldest inhabited building in Europe. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5923.900000000001s)]
*  Vikings invaded England in the same year the first brick was laid in 793. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5926.14s)]
*  I suspect Vikings would like this place. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5931.42s)]
*  They would love this place. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5933.18s)]
*  Before we go further, let's define our terms. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5935.34s)]
*  We're not talking about mere bars, or, for the love of God, sports bars. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5938.14s)]
*  These are pubs, short for public houses. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5943.26s)]
*  They exist as much for conviviality as for what's on tap. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5946.860000000001s)]
*  Cold lager, and to the shock of first timers, warm ale. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5950.860000000001s)]
*  They've been cornerstones of the culture here for centuries. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5955.26s)]
*  The writer slash comedian Al Murray believes the value proposition goes well beyond beer. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5958.7s)]
*  It's a community place. It's a communitarian place. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5964.22s)]
*  In a way that sitting in your front room watching television just isn't. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5967.02s)]
*  What is it about this culture that has such appeal to you? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5970.38s)]
*  To sound sort of idealistic about it, printers and paupers are equally welcome in here. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5973.26s)]
*  And given that Britain is such a class-ridden society, there are very few places where, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5979.820000000001s)]
*  you know, you stand at the bar and your money's as good as anyone else's. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5985.900000000001s)]
*  You sound like a pub romantic. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5988.860000000001s)]
*  I am completely romantic about the idea of pubs. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5990.7s)]
*  There is something genuinely beautiful about the idea of somewhere where anyone can go at any time [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5993.66s)]
*  and sit in a corner with their own thoughts and a drink and it's a beautiful notion. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=5999.42s)]
*  You don't go to Turner's Old Star for quiet contemplation. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6005.34s)]
*  One of the last of the so-called boosers in London's East End, [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6009.42s)]
*  it's the heartbeat of the proudly working class community here. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6013.34s)]
*  Put in a day of work, you work hard, you come in and then you... [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6017.26s)]
*  Absolutely, you work hard all day and then you kind of like... [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6019.98s)]
*  It's just like having a mental shower after a hard day's work, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6023.34s)]
*  just to kind of wind down. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6026.54s)]
*  It's like a real-life cheers, I guess, you know? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6028.860000000001s)]
*  That makes you feel welcome. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6031.5s)]
*  You feel welcome. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6032.62s)]
*  Paul and Bernice Drew have run the Old Star for 17 years. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6035.820000000001s)]
*  They met across the street, got engaged here, they live upstairs. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6039.9800000000005s)]
*  The pub is their living room. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6044.9400000000005s)]
*  The regulars, their oldest friends. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6047.02s)]
*  When you say regulars though, these are really regulars. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6049.42s)]
*  Oh yeah, everybody. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6051.5s)]
*  Everyone from naught to 90 enjoys this. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6052.54s)]
*  There's a core of people, I suppose, 10, 15 people, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6055.1s)]
*  that come in every day, regardless, winter, summer, whenever. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6059.0199999999995s)]
*  They all come up, have their couple of beers, [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6062.94s)]
*  have a laugh, chew the wag, as they say, [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6065.42s)]
*  and, you know, slag everyone off. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6068.46s)]
*  Always having to go at each other. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6071.18s)]
*  I hear you say with a real pride, this is proper pub. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6072.7s)]
*  It is. It's my pub-pub. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6075.74s)]
*  That's what we call it, don't we? [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6077.82s)]
*  No, it's a pub-pub. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6079.18s)]
*  We call it a pub-pub. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6079.98s)]
*  For centuries, pubs have been as much salon as saloon, [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6081.74s)]
*  as they've taken a stool and watched history and myth unfold. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6085.5s)]
*  In London's Soho, the French House was where Bohemians [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6089.98s)]
*  would rub shoulders with resistance leaders. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6093.339999999999s)]
*  After Paris fell to the Nazis in 1940, Charles de Gaulle, in exile, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6096.299999999999s)]
*  is said to have written his famous speech to the French Free Forces here. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6101.5s)]
*  A little further east on the River Thames, [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6106.7s)]
*  legend has it that the 17th century Judge Jefferies [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6109.02s)]
*  would watch those he sentenced hang as he lunched and sipped ale at the prospect of Whitby. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6112.620000000001s)]
*  And then there's the cholera epidemic that gripped London in 1854, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6119.1s)]
*  killing 550 people in two weeks. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6123.34s)]
*  A local doctor, John Snow, figured out the problem. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6126.9400000000005s)]
*  Contaminated water from a well was spreading the disease, [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6130.06s)]
*  and simply removing the handle from the pump effectively ended the epidemic. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6133.5s)]
*  John Snow wasn't knighted, but he did receive what might be the next highest British honor. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6139.42s)]
*  Christening a pub after someone is an exception. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6145.18s)]
*  Many pub names read like drunken mad libs, random adjective plus random noun, often an animal, [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6149.1s)]
*  the ape and apple, the snooty fox, the drunken duck, the black dog. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6157.02s)]
*  For Pete Brown, Britain's leading writer on beer and pubs, [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6163.740000000001s)]
*  these names offer a clue to every establishment's story. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6167.26s)]
*  What's going on here? [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6171.26s)]
*  It's become one of the quirky aspects of the British pub, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6172.860000000001s)]
*  but it starts off in a very practical way, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6175.18s)]
*  which is that most of the population who went to pubs until recently were illiterate. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6177.66s)]
*  So you couldn't put a name sign up, you had to have a pictorial sign. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6182.860000000001s)]
*  So you'd pick a picture of something that had some resonance with people. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6187.74s)]
*  But then some of the ones that you just mentioned, [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6191.9800000000005s)]
*  it's kind of the pub self-saturizing itself. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6194.0599999999995s)]
*  And it's not just pub names that veer toward the colorful and eccentric. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6198.3s)]
*  Just behind London's law courts, and then behind the bar, [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6203.0199999999995s)]
*  you'll find the owner, chef and star performer of the Seven Stars pub, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6206.86s)]
*  the talented Mrs. Roxy Beaujolais. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6211.5s)]
*  Your husband is American. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6214.46s)]
*  Yes. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6215.66s)]
*  How do you explain what you do to his family? [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6216.46s)]
*  Well, when I was first introduced to them about 30 years ago, [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6218.86s)]
*  his mother asked me what I did. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6222.22s)]
*  And I said, I'm a publican. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6224.3s)]
*  She said, what? [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6225.66s)]
*  And my husband dove in and said, no, no, no, no, no, mama, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6227.26s)]
*  not a Republican, a publican, a tavern keeper. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6232.22s)]
*  What is it about this job that clearly feeds something in you? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6236.46s)]
*  I'm good at it, darling. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6241.34s)]
*  I mean, I'm good at it. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6242.7s)]
*  You know, I talk, I have a passing interest in the product that I sell myself. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6244.3s)]
*  I love it. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6250.38s)]
*  For the last 25 years, comedian Al Murray has loved playing the figure behind the bar. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6251.5s)]
*  His alter ego on stages, a head shaved, over opinionated blowhard, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6258.0599999999995s)]
*  he calls the pub landlord. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6262.94s)]
*  We're sensible people in this country, don't we? [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6264.94s)]
*  Down to earth people. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6267.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we never put the man on the moon. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6269.66s)]
*  No, the moon was never going to be part of the British Empire, was it, by chance? [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6271.82s)]
*  There's no one to give it back to once we're done with it, is there? [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6276.86s)]
*  So what is it about that archetype? [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6279.9800000000005s)]
*  He's a know-all who knows nothing. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6282.780000000001s)]
*  It's a guy who has power but no authority. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6284.46s)]
*  It's a guy who is writing intellectual checks he can't possibly cash. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6288.14s)]
*  There's a mile, mile wide, inch deep. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6292.540000000001s)]
*  It's the whole swirl of what happens in a pub. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6294.46s)]
*  The publican is the conduit, the confessor, the sort of, you know, high priest in a space like this. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6297.5s)]
*  So all goes through him. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6304.700000000001s)]
*  It's all good fun, but as his character suggests, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6306.46s)]
*  pub culture is, if not eroding, undergoing considerable change. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6309.900000000001s)]
*  For generations, the number of British pubs has been declining, [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6315.18s)]
*  from 65,000 to fewer than 50,000 in the last 25 years. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6319.34s)]
*  The causes of death are many. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6324.38s)]
*  High beer duty, a smoking ban, cheap supermarket lager, people drinking less. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6326.14s)]
*  Perhaps the biggest culprits? [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6331.9800000000005s)]
*  Venture capitalists and developers more interested in a pub's real estate than what's on tap. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6333.82s)]
*  And then in March 2020 came the hammer blow, COVID-19. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6339.82s)]
*  What was it like when this closed for the first time? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6345.02s)]
*  So destroying, I mean, in business terms, lethal. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6347.900000000001s)]
*  I still haven't got any words for it, John. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6356.860000000001s)]
*  It's, it's, we have a passion to open the door every single day. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6359.5s)]
*  This wasn't just change the sign on the door. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6364.54s)]
*  This sounds almost existential. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6366.62s)]
*  It's terminal for a lot of pubs. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6369.179999999999s)]
*  Even in the worst of times, the Napoleonic Wars, the Spanish Flu, pubs did not close. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6372.139999999999s)]
*  Despite the bombings and the blitz, Churchill insisted that pubs remain open. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6381.099999999999s)]
*  How bad can things be if we can still pull a pint? [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6385.259999999999s)]
*  It's a little story to show that the spirit of the pubs is excellent. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6388.94s)]
*  The houses bombed, they carry on outside. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6391.9s)]
*  The lockdown gave Britain a glimpse of a future without pubs. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6397.66s)]
*  For months, the cobbled streets where Dickens once walked, silent. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6402.139999999999s)]
*  The taverns where Chaucer or Shakespeare might have drunk, empty. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6406.94s)]
*  Millions of barrels of beer literally down the drain. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6411.66s)]
*  What does this country stand to lose if pubs diminish? [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6415.580000000001s)]
*  Like part of its identity, we celebrate our nationality in a very quiet way, [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6419.42s)]
*  in a very modest way. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6424.540000000001s)]
*  And the pub is a perfect example of that. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6426.14s)]
*  We're proud of the pub. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6428.06s)]
*  And if it was taken away from us, I think we'd lose something of what defines us as a nation. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6429.18s)]
*  It's not flag-waving jingoism, but coming in here is sort of an act of patriotism, you're saying? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6433.9800000000005s)]
*  It's just coming in and just going, yeah, I'll have another pint. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6439.740000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6443.34s)]
*  Coming out of lockdown, the pint-wielding patriots believed more than ever that the [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6445.02s)]
*  pub is an institution worth saving. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6452.9400000000005s)]
*  Saving the traditional pub, is that nostalgia for a Britain that may no longer exist? [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6456.14s)]
*  Oh, there are so many Britons that may no longer exist, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6463.9800000000005s)]
*  but the one that's worth saving is the pub, surely. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6466.540000000001s)]
*  I mean, you know, we don't need a Navy anymore, do we? [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6469.02s)]
*  We need pubs. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6471.660000000001s)]
*  In a changing Britain, nostalgia can reside at the bottom of a glass. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6472.38s)]
*  In the Oso English village of Aldworth in Berkshire, [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6478.38s)]
*  you'll find just a cricket green, a church, a few houses, and a pub resistant to time. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6481.900000000001s)]
*  The Bell Inn has been in the family of Heather McCauley for 200 years. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6489.9800000000005s)]
*  She was born in the pub and now, at age 85, runs it with her son Hugh. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6494.38s)]
*  How many generations in these 200 years? [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6502.78s)]
*  We go, there's James and Hugh and Thomas and Ronald, and then me, five, I suppose. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6505.18s)]
*  We've talked to some pub owners who've said they felt this pressure to evolve [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6513.26s)]
*  and they're trying gourmet food and DJs and technology. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6517.1s)]
*  Here, no. We are plain, simple. That's how we survive. That's how we're going to survive. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6523.1s)]
*  I don't think we'll ever be putting TVs in here somehow. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6529.5s)]
*  No, no. Well, I don't even have a mobile phone. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6532.38s)]
*  Pubs like the Bell Inns and the Old Stars have done what they've always done, [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6536.86s)]
*  served their community. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6540.86s)]
*  But where does the rest of the country fit in? Nigerian-born Clement Ougbenaia, [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6543.42s)]
*  he's proud owner of the Prince of Peckham in South London. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6548.86s)]
*  He has taken the magic of the pub and adapted it to multicultural 21st century Britain. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6552.46s)]
*  You hear the word pub 20 years ago, what are you thinking? [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6557.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm thinking I'm not going there. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6560.86s)]
*  So play that out for me. You walk into a conventional pub and what happens? [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6563.179999999999s)]
*  Think of Clint Eastwood in a western movie. It's like everyone looks at the door swinging. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6567.0199999999995s)]
*  Who's that guy? That's how I felt at some pubs. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6572.3s)]
*  So I walked in. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6575.66s)]
*  Piano stops playing. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6576.219999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6577.099999999999s)]
*  Four years ago, Clement bought up a neighborhood joint [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6579.34s)]
*  destined to be turned into an apartment block or a mini market. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6582.38s)]
*  Pubs play a massive part in representing the communities, [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6586.7s)]
*  representing the underrepresented, the marginalized, and giving them a space, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6589.98s)]
*  giving them somewhere where they can actually be. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6594.3s)]
*  They can congregate. They can share ideas. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6596.22s)]
*  When kids today hear the word pub, what do you want them to think? [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6599.42s)]
*  I want them to think that's a space for me. That's a space where I can be. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6603.099999999999s)]
*  That's a space where I can celebrate. That's a space where I can hang out. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6607.5s)]
*  I can laugh. I can mourn. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6610.94s)]
*  That's what you're going for when you open this place. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6612.46s)]
*  Yeah, I just love seeing the melting pot that is London reflected in this pub. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6614.14s)]
*  And herein might lie the key to the pub's survival. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6622.22s)]
*  Cater to an evolving and ever-changing Britain, [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6626.38s)]
*  and beer and good cheer might well flow in equal measure. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6629.5s)]
*  Those pints, after all, aren't going to drink themselves. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv78w2B_VGE&t=6633.18s)]
