# Violent, suspicious deaths of Putin foes | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM)
*  The expression mysterious Russian death syndrome is a grim turn of phrase used to describe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=0.0s)]
*  the falls from top floor windows, poisonings, and unsolved shootings of President Vladimir [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=18.2s)]
*  Putin's enemies. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Since the invasion of Ukraine two years ago, he has used these methods to go after more [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=25.12s)]
*  of his critics on Western soil. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=29.84s)]
*  Last month, the head of Britain's domestic spy agency, MI5, said Russia is on a, quote, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=32.36s)]
*  sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets as part of what U.S. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=38.12s)]
*  intelligence officials call Putin's war on the West. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=43.68s)]
*  Tonight, evidence of this in one of the most brazen assassinations ever committed outside [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=47.16s)]
*  of Russia. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  Villa Joyosa is a seaside resort town on Spain's Mediterranean coast. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=56.64s)]
*  Many of the residents who live there year-round are from Russia and Ukraine. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=61.56s)]
*  But this past February, the town whose name translates to Joyful Village was the scene [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=66.88s)]
*  of a horrific murder that made international headlines. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=72.2s)]
*  Inside a parking garage, the victim's body was discovered riddled with bullet holes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=76.36s)]
*  It looked like a mafia-style contract killing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=81.56s)]
*  One of the witnesses at the scene was the building's handyman, Ruben Ferrandiz. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=85.84s)]
*  I was inside a section of the garage cleaning, and I heard a car speeding up the ramp really [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=93.28s)]
*  fast. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=97.84s)]
*  Ferrandiz told us he checked the exit ramp of the garage, and that's when he saw a body [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=99.84s)]
*  lying face-up on the pavement. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=104.88s)]
*  We didn't touch him, but we saw he was already dead. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=108.36s)]
*  Ferrandiz said he called for help. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=113.08s)]
*  How many times had he been shot? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=115.36s)]
*  They opened up his T-shirt, and he had a bullet, one bullet, right in his heart. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=120.88s)]
*  One in his heart, one in his ribs, and in his belly he had some. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=128.16s)]
*  The lady from the ambulance said he'd been shot five times. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=131.96s)]
*  Police later identified the victim as a 28-year-old Russian named Maxim Kuzmenov. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=137.52s)]
*  In 2023, Kuzmenov bought an apartment inside this high-rise complex. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=142.8s)]
*  His murder was not the first time Kuzmenov had made international headlines. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  He was a military helicopter pilot in Russia who defected after being recruited online [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=154.56s)]
*  by Ukrainian intelligence officers. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=159.8s)]
*  They helped him plan his escape. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  This is the helicopter Kuzmenov flew on August 9, 2023, below radar so he wasn't detected [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=164.98000000000002s)]
*  as he crossed the front lines from Russia into Ukraine. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=172.36s)]
*  Kuzmenov handed over the helicopter, seen in this footage from the Ukrainian military. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  He also gave them sensitive military equipment and top-secret Russian intelligence. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=181.56s)]
*  In return, Ukraine gave Kuzmenov half a million dollars and a new Ukrainian identity. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=187.28s)]
*  It was a big victory for Ukraine, which had Kuzmenov tell his story on national TV. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=193.68s)]
*  What is happening now is simply a genocide of Ukrainian people, both Ukrainian and Russian people. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=199.56s)]
*  I did it because I didn't want to be part of these crimes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=208.2s)]
*  I know exactly how this will end. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  Ukraine will definitely win this war because its people are very united. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=215.56s)]
*  Kuzmenov's Ukrainian handlers warned him not to leave the country because of fears [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=219.4s)]
*  Putin would send a Russian military kill team after him. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=224.14s)]
*  But he didn't listen. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=228.16s)]
*  In Spain this summer, we went to the garage where Kuzmenov was killed and saw for ourselves [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=232.24s)]
*  the bullet holes, the crime scene and the placement of security cameras. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=237.56s)]
*  We were told those security cameras recorded the murder and that the footage showed two [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=245.66s)]
*  assassins entering the garage and hiding in the backseat of their car behind tinted glass. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=250.24s)]
*  They waited for five hours for Kuzmenov to show up to his parking spot, then they sprayed [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=256.02s)]
*  him with bullets. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=261.09999999999997s)]
*  Did you not hear gunshots? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=263.38s)]
*  No. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=265.38s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=266.38s)]
*  It was completely silent? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=267.38s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=268.38s)]
*  I just heard the car leave in a big hurry and that's when I came out, but I didn't hear [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=269.38s)]
*  any gunshots. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  What does that tell you about the weapons that they used? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=275.46s)]
*  That they used to silence her because otherwise I would have heard the gunshots. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=279.65999999999997s)]
*  The assassins fled the scene and burned the getaway car with an industrial grade accelerant. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=284.06s)]
*  This would have destroyed any GPS tracking in the car, hiding their trail. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=289.82s)]
*  The remnants were discovered on the other side of a tunnel in a place so isolated the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=294.82s)]
*  killers likely would have needed help from locals to know the location. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=299.82s)]
*  This is not amateur hour. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=304.14s)]
*  These guys know what they're doing and they've probably killed people before. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  Michael Weiss has been researching Russian intelligence services for decades. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=308.42s)]
*  He's the U.S. editor at the Insider, an investigative magazine created by Russian journalists in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=312.86s)]
*  exile. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=318.82s)]
*  How was Maxim Kuzmenov killed? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=320.3s)]
*  So his murder bears all the hallmarks of a professional hit. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=322.22s)]
*  We know that he was being surveilled for weeks, if not months beforehand because the killers [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=326.42s)]
*  knew his movements. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=331.04s)]
*  The weapon that they used, we don't know exactly if it was a pistol or what, but the ammunition [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=332.74s)]
*  was Russian, so a signature leaving something behind that at least telegraphs where it's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=338.54s)]
*  coming from. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=343.16s)]
*  That sounds like a huge piece of evidence. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=344.16s)]
*  It's leading back to Moscow, which they want you to know that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=347.66s)]
*  You know, they want to be able to say, you can't prove it was us, but come on, let's [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=351.3s)]
*  be honest, you know it was us. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=355.70000000000005s)]
*  Kuzmenov did not live a quiet life in Spain. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=357.82000000000005s)]
*  A neighbor told us that he often drank at this local bar and was heard bragging about [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=360.82000000000005s)]
*  who he really was. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=366.02000000000004s)]
*  Local authorities here in Villa Joyosa are no longer in charge of the investigation into [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=368.54s)]
*  Kuzmenov's death. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=372.5s)]
*  That's now in the hands of the Spanish Civil Guard, the equivalent of the FBI. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=374.22s)]
*  But there is a gag order in this case and authorities have said very little about it [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=378.8s)]
*  publicly except to issue a stern warning. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=382.86s)]
*  If it is proven that Russia is behind the death of Maxim Kuzmenov, Spain will issue [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=386.34s)]
*  a forceful response. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=391.06s)]
*  But so far they've done nothing. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=393.58s)]
*  If they requested interviews with half a dozen local and federal Spanish officials [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=395.94s)]
*  about the Kuzmenov case, no one would talk. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=400.1s)]
*  His death was celebrated on Russian state television and by the former prime minister. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=405.3s)]
*  When Russian reporters asked him about Kuzmenov, he was blunt. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=412.7s)]
*  For a dog, a dog's death. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=416.46s)]
*  A source close to the investigation gave 60 Minutes these photos of men who they say [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=422.98s)]
*  were identified by Spanish authorities as persons of interest who were in Spain at the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=427.78000000000003s)]
*  time of Kuzmenov's murder. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=432.94s)]
*  60 Minutes has learned the man on the left is a former KGB officer and the man in the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=435.1s)]
*  middle, his relative, is a Russian police colonel. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=440.22s)]
*  It's yet another indicator that the Russian government may be involved. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=443.94s)]
*  What do you think killed Maxim Kuzmenov? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=448.1s)]
*  I absolutely think it was the Russian special services. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=450.66s)]
*  I don't think there's any doubt in anyone's mind, least of all, Ukrainians or Russians, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=453.58000000000004s)]
*  that he was liquidated by Moscow. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=458.94s)]
*  And it appears the Ukrainians are pushing back. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=461.70000000000005s)]
*  In a bizarre twist straight out of a spy thriller, Kuzmenov seemed to rise from the dead five [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=464.58000000000004s)]
*  months after he was killed. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  These pictures appeared this summer on social media showing a man who looked like Kuzmenov [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=472.22s)]
*  at an air show. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=477.42s)]
*  60 Minutes has learned it was likely a Ukrainian intelligence officer wearing an elaborate [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=479.1s)]
*  disguise, including a mask made to look nearly identical to the Russian defector. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=484.38s)]
*  The Ukrainians were conducting their own misinformation campaign, trying to beat the Russians at their [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=490.22s)]
*  own game. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=495.46s)]
*  Their goal? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=496.84000000000003s)]
*  To make the world think Kuzmenov had survived the assassination attempt and was still working [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  for Ukraine, a show to other potential Russians that they would be safe if they too defected. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=502.98s)]
*  We confirmed that the real Kuzmenov was buried in an unmarked grave in southern Spain. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=509.62s)]
*  Why would the Spanish government not be screaming from the rooftops about a murder on their soil? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=515.74s)]
*  Because it's going to lead to panic. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=521.58s)]
*  If you're a tourist, you want a vacation in Alicante knowing that you might be collateral [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=522.94s)]

*  Is this Western governments looking the other way in some cases? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=529.94s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=534.18s)]
*  Why is the price of looking directly into the eyes of the Kremlin is what? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=535.66s)]
*  What's the risk? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=539.02s)]
*  Well, there's also a fear of escalation. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=540.02s)]
*  That's because there have been more than 60 mysterious deaths of Putin's enemies in Russia [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=543.02s)]

*  It has European officials increasingly on edge about how much Putin gets away with. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=576.58s)]

*  What do you think is behind that? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=603.74s)]
*  This is challenging the order, the stability of Europe and actually testing. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=605.5799999999999s)]
*  Testing because they want to push to see how much they can get away with? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=612.8399999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=616.4599999999999s)]
*  All those sabotage, cyber or attacks on critical infrastructure is actually happening on EU [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=617.46s)]

*  He understands only the language of strength. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=639.7800000000001s)]
*  In addition to the assassinations, Russia has been implicated in sabotage attacks, including [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=643.5799999999999s)]
*  a fire bombing at a German factory owned by a leading weapons company, an attack on one [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=648.98s)]

*  Is Putin at war with the West? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=661.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, of course, yes. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=663.38s)]
*  We have to take him actually not only seriously, but literally. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=664.88s)]
*  As a result of Putin's summer of mayhem, last month the EU announced a new type of sanctions [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=669.86s)]
*  aimed at the organizations and people that carry out violence for Russia. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=675.52s)]

*  then the sanctions could be aimed at them. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=686.38s)]
*  The question is whether sanctions and diplomacy are working. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=688.76s)]
*  You just have to imagine and think what could happen if we don't have neither sanctions, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=692.5600000000001s)]
*  neither diplomacy, neither economic measures. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=697.58s)]
*  The war would be in the different scale and different attitude if we don't have those sanctions. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=700.0200000000001s)]
*  But as we sit here today, is it fair to say that Russia is winning? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=707.34s)]
*  Well, definitely not. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=711.82s)]

*  I think not. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=720.34s)]
*  Is what Russia is doing in Europe a warning for the United States? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=722.2800000000001s)]
*  It's the warning for everyone of us. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=727.3s)]
*  That they are not really only in Ukraine with the war, they are here. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=730.66s)]
*  It's actually happening everywhere. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=738.9399999999999s)]
*  So that's why we have to be vigilant, every one of us. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=740.38s)]
*  Is Vladimir Putin bringing his war on the West to U.S. soil? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=744.6999999999999s)]

*  U.S. Department of Justice. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=753.62s)]
*  If the brazen assassination of Russian defector Maxim Kuzminov is a warning to Europe about [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=757.3s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's long violent reach, what could it mean for the United States? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=771.9799999999999s)]
*  Is the country prepared for Putin going after his critics on U.S. soil? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=777.2199999999999s)]
*  It turns out he's already come close. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=781.92s)]
*  Tonight, Matt Olson, the head of the National Security Division at the Justice Department, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=784.7s)]
*  says he's concerned that what happened to Kuzminov in Spain could happen here. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=789.7s)]
*  Mysterious Russian death syndrome. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=795.82s)]
*  Accurate way to describe what's happened to some of Putin critics? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=798.14s)]
*  Yeah, we're not really seeing things that are particularly mysterious. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=801.1s)]
*  They're all pretty black and white to you? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=803.74s)]
*  I don't think Putin is trying to hide his hand. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=805.3s)]
*  I think quite the opposite. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=807.78s)]
*  I think these are, they're going after their critics, both to eliminate the critics, but [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=809.3s)]
*  also to send a stark and chilling message. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=814.38s)]
*  He's not hiding his M.O.? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=817.42s)]
*  He's not hiding his M.O. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=818.74s)]
*  He is going after them because he wants not just those individuals, but anyone who would [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=820.06s)]
*  think about doing the same thing to think twice and to be worried about what will happen [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=824.9799999999999s)]
*  to me if I go down that same path. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=829.66s)]
*  Matt Olson's team at the Department of Justice has prosecuted nearly 60 cases in U.S. courts [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=832.54s)]
*  related to Russian disinformation, sanctions violations and espionage since the Russian [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=837.86s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=843.74s)]
*  I think we should be very, very concerned about how aggressive Putin is being in going [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=845.3000000000001s)]
*  after the United States as well as our allies. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=850.1s)]
*  As we sit here today, can you say whether there are Russian assets currently working [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=852.0600000000001s)]
*  in the United States right now? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=857.7s)]
*  There certainly are Russian intelligence assets in the United States working on a range of [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=859.74s)]
*  threats to the United States. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=868.1s)]
*  How much of a danger do they pose? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=869.54s)]
*  They are engaged in repressing people who are critics of the Putin regime. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=871.14s)]
*  And in between, they're conducting foreign malign influence. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=876.78s)]
*  They're attempting to interfere in our elections and our politics. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=879.9s)]
*  They are carrying out cyber attacks and putting our critical infrastructure at risk. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=885.3399999999999s)]
*  Has it gotten worse since the war in Ukraine? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=891.06s)]
*  I think essentially that the Russian intelligence services over the past couple of years have [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=893.66s)]
*  been on a war footing. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=898.8199999999999s)]
*  We are working really closely with our counterparts in Europe, both on the law enforcement and [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=900.3s)]
*  the intelligence side, to make sure that we're sharing information, sharing intelligence [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=906.14s)]
*  and sharing really best practices. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=910.4599999999999s)]
*  Earlier this year, U.S. intelligence officials provided information that allowed Germany [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=912.62s)]
*  to stop a Russian assassination attempt before it happened, saving the life of a CEO of [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=917.86s)]
*  a German company that provides weapons to Ukraine. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=923.58s)]
*  But there have been many other plots that weren't stopped. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=926.62s)]
*  The case of Maxim Kuzmenov in Spain, could something like that happen here? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=930.34s)]
*  It was a particularly brazen act by the assassins to kill him in his garage of his apartment. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=935.14s)]
*  You can never rule out, I think, that something like that can happen in any country, given [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=940.9000000000001s)]
*  how aggressive Russia's intelligence services have been. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=946.1800000000001s)]
*  I will say that it is a focus of us in the Justice Department and the FBI to do everything [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=950.14s)]
*  we can to prevent that kind of activity. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=956.98s)]
*  But the same thing almost did happen here in Miami in 2020. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=959.38s)]
*  Russian defector Alexander Potaya was followed and his car photographed in his apartment [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=964.34s)]
*  garage in the Miami Trump Towers by someone hired by Russian intelligence. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=969.62s)]
*  It was straight out of the same playbook as the Kuzmenov killing, but here on U.S. soil. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=975.22s)]
*  What is concerning to you about what happened in that case? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=981.0600000000001s)]
*  The concern is that Russia actually tasked someone to locate and find this individual. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=984.34s)]
*  The obvious next steps would be potentially carry off some sort of operation, but luckily [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=989.78s)]
*  that was stopped before it happened. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=993.98s)]
*  Alan Kohler retired in 2023 from the FBI as assistant director for counterintelligence. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=995.86s)]
*  His team was responsible for the Potaya investigation that led to this man, a Mexican citizen named [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1002.54s)]
*  Hector Fuentes. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1008.5799999999999s)]
*  Fuentes had studied in Russia and had a Russian family. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1010.18s)]
*  Russia prevented his Russian wife from leaving the country and in exchange for cooperation [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1014.02s)]
*  on that, Fuentes agreed to carry out some activities on behalf of the Russian intelligence [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1018.66s)]
*  services. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1023.26s)]
*  The main one of those was to rent an apartment in a particular apartment complex in Florida [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1024.3s)]
*  and then later to actually go there and do surveillance to locate the sources car. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1029.9s)]
*  In Miami, a security guard saw Fuentes tailgating another car to slip into the parking garage. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1034.46s)]
*  Fuentes was later arrested and admitted he was working for Russian intelligence. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1040.7s)]
*  He pleaded guilty to acting as a foreign agent. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1045.46s)]
*  So in that situation, it all worked out. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1048.5s)]
*  There was no harm done. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1052.5800000000002s)]
*  There was an arrest. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1054.8200000000002s)]
*  Did that case tell you that Russia is this close from being able to pull that off? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1055.82s)]
*  Oh, it certainly tells us Russia could pull it off if they really put the effort into [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1061.34s)]
*  it. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1066.1s)]

*  There's only one known picture of him from his early days in the Russian army, but Potayev [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1077.54s)]
*  was a double agent working for the U.S. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1083.02s)]

*  The case was the basis of the hit TV show The Americans. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1101.54s)]

*  In real life, Alexander Potayev was their boss and ran the group of illegal agents [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1108.92s)]
*  from Moscow until he gave their identities away to U.S. intelligence and defected to [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1114.24s)]
*  Miami. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1119.96s)]
*  For that, Putin wanted him dead. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1121.0800000000002s)]
*  Sources told 60 Minutes Potayev is still alive and is in hiding, but Kohler warns that Putin [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1124.24s)]
*  is fully capable of killing an enemy on U.S. soil. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1129.8400000000001s)]
*  Is it just a matter of time that that happens? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1133.8000000000002s)]
*  The decision to do something like that is a calculus that has to be done inside of Russia. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1135.96s)]
*  And they have to determine, is the effort and the blowback they're going to get in the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1142.88s)]
*  international stage worth the incremental benefit that they get from killing a certain [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1146.64s)]
*  individual? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1151.64s)]
*  Kohler says the FBI has the resources to fight back against Russia in the United States, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1152.64s)]
*  but it can be very difficult to stop a determined assassin. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1158.16s)]
*  So I don't want to make it sound like Russia's 10 feet tall and bulletproof, because they're [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1162.24s)]
*  not. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1165.04s)]
*  But it's also not hard to kill somebody. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1166.04s)]
*  You know, take the United States, for example. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1168.32s)]
*  There's thousands and thousands of people that land from overseas every single day. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1170.6s)]
*  The FBI and Department of Homeland Security, we can't track every one of those. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1175.68s)]
*  You know, it's possible that they could actually carry out those attacks without law enforcement, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1179.84s)]
*  FBI, anybody else knowing about it. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1185.08s)]

*  that look like a suicide? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1192.08s)]
*  They could, sure. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1193.56s)]

*  The business of counterintelligence and trying to counter what other countries are trying [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1201.2s)]
*  to do is they deliberately try to obfuscate and hide their efforts. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1204.8s)]
*  So if they wanted somebody killed and they were and they came in and did it without an [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1209.2s)]
*  intelligence tie and use maybe a conduit or a third party, it would be very difficult [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1214.48s)]

*  The Washington, D.C. death of a vocal Putin critic named Dan Rapoport could be one of [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1220.6s)]
*  those cases where Russia is trying to cover its tracks. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1225.84s)]
*  Rapoport was a financier from Latvia with ties to Russia and Ukraine. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1229.56s)]
*  He died after falling from his apartment building in 2022, about a mile from the White [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1234.36s)]

*  police and the case is still open. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1252.32s)]
*  Retired FBI agent Alan Kohler told us D.C. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1255.1599999999999s)]
*  authorities never briefed him on the case when he was the head of counterintelligence. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1258.68s)]
*  My takeaway from from Russia right now is the U.S. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1263.48s)]
*  took its eye off of Russia after 9-11 when we all pivoted and really the world pivoted [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1267.84s)]
*  towards counterterrorism. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1272.76s)]
*  But to dismiss them as an intelligence threat would be unwise for all of us to do. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1274.48s)]

*  The same people are still in charge. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1284.44s)]
*  They have the same capabilities and the intent to do all the things they've done in the [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1285.96s)]

*  In many ways, yes. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1295.92s)]
*  So he's been able to poison and kill his way around the world for over a decade now [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1297.4s)]

*  Tonight, the story of one of them. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1350.04s)]
*  Vladimir Karamurza was an opposition activist on the front lines, protesting Putin's [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1352.96s)]
*  policies, organizing demonstrations and town hall meetings. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1358.92s)]
*  He knew he was on a dangerous mission. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1363.8s)]
*  When we met him last year, he told us that one day in May 2015, he learned just how [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1366.6s)]
*  dangerous. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1373.2s)]
*  I was in a work meeting with my colleagues in Moscow when I suddenly started to feel [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1374.56s)]
*  really sick and I went within about 20 minutes from feeling completely normal to feeling [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1379.52s)]
*  like a very sick man. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1384.4399999999998s)]
*  And I don't remember anything for the next month. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1385.4399999999998s)]
*  You were out for a month. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1387.84s)]
*  I was in a coma for a week and I don't remember anything for a month and had basically a [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1389.04s)]
*  cascade of all my major life organs failing one after another, just switching off, you [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1393.04s)]
*  know, the lungs, the heart, the kidneys. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1397.12s)]
*  He was shuttled from hospital to hospital in Moscow for two days as doctors frantically [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1399.12s)]
*  tried to figure out what was wrong with him. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1404.72s)]
*  I was at one point connected, I think, to eight different artificial life support machines. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1407.0400000000002s)]
*  And doctors told my wife that it's only going to be about five percent chance that I'll [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1411.2s)]
*  survive. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1415.2800000000002s)]
*  But he beat the odds. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1416.2800000000002s)]
*  When we spoke with him last year, he'd been recovering for a year, but he was still [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1418.0800000000002s)]
*  walking with a limp from nerve damage. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1423.4s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1425.96s)]
*  Well, it was some kind of a very strong toxin. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1427.16s)]
*  We don't know what it was because, you know, with these things, as people who know more [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1429.4s)]
*  about this than I do, explain to me, you basically have to know exactly what you're [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1433.44s)]
*  testing for in order to find it. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1436.92s)]
*  So they never found the exact compound? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1438.4s)]
*  They never did. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1440.28s)]
*  It wasn't till the fourth day and after he'd been on a dialysis machine that blood was [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1441.28s)]
*  drawn and sent to a toxicology lab in France. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1446.8400000000001s)]
*  It found heavy metals in his blood, but no specific toxin. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1450.72s)]
*  Still, Caramurza maintains that he was poisoned. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1455.4s)]
*  I have absolutely no doubt that he was poisoned. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1459.3600000000001s)]
*  I have absolutely no doubt that this was deliberate poisoning, that it was intended to kill, because, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1462.08s)]
*  as I mentioned already, the doctors told my wife that it's about a five percent chance [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1468.8s)]
*  of survival. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1472.0s)]
*  And when it's that kind of percentage, it's not to scare, it's to kill. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1473.0s)]
*  Can you be sure that what happened to you was directed by Mr. Putin? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1475.8s)]
*  Well, of that I have no idea. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1480.12s)]
*  I don't know the precise circumstances. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1481.64s)]
*  I don't know the who or the how, but I do know why. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1483.04s)]
*  Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1486.2s)]
*  In recent years, quite a few of Putin's enemies have perished by swallowing things they shouldn't have. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1489.76s)]
*  In 2006, Russian spy turned Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko drank tea laced with [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1496.24s)]
*  polonium 210. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1503.64s)]
*  Two years earlier, the Ukrainian politician Viktor Yushchenko had somehow ingested dioxin. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1505.8799999999999s)]
*  He survived, but was disfigured. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1512.6s)]
*  But what would the motive be in the case of the critic Vladimir Karamurza? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1516.16s)]
*  Cambridge educated he was for years a Washington-based reporter for a Russian TV station. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1520.52s)]
*  So he was well connected and had perfect English, which he used to incessantly criticize the [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1527.1200000000001s)]
*  regime on the international stage. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1533.3600000000001s)]
*  A government that is based on genuine support does not need to jail its opponents. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1536.08s)]
*  As if his outspokenness wasn't enough to anger the Kremlin, he made matters worse for [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1540.8400000000001s)]
*  himself when he joined forces with this man. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1545.76s)]
*  It's death if you cross the Putin regime. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1549.08s)]
*  Bill Browder was for years the largest foreign investor in Russia and Putin's champion. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1552.12s)]
*  But he turned into a dogged adversary when his Russian tax attorney Sergei Magnitsky [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1557.76s)]
*  blew the whistle on alleged large-scale theft by government officials. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1563.72s)]
*  We discovered massive corruption of the Putin regime. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1568.2s)]
*  Sergei exposed it, testified against the officials involved. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1571.84s)]
*  He was subsequently arrested, put in pretrial detention, tortured for 358 days and killed [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1576.12s)]
*  at the age of 37. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1582.6399999999999s)]
*  Browder was so outraged he joined with Vladimir Karamurza to lobby the U.S. Congress for a [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1584.6s)]
*  law targeting those responsible for that death and other human rights violations. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1590.56s)]
*  They succeeded. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1596.44s)]
*  The Magnitsky Act passed in 2012. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1597.68s)]
*  It's the first law that sanctions individual Russians, 44 so far. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1600.96s)]
*  The Magnitsky Act is designed to sanction, to freeze the assets and ban the visas for [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1606.68s)]
*  people who commit these types of crimes in Russia. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1614.52s)]
*  So they can't get to their money, which may be stashed in the United States. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1617.56s)]
*  And so Vladimir Putin is extremely angry that the Magnitsky Act was going to be passed. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1621.0s)]
*  He was even angrier when it got passed. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1626.44s)]
*  And he was even angrier when people started getting added, names started getting added [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1628.64s)]
*  to the Magnitsky list. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1632.44s)]
*  One reason Vladimir Karamurza is convinced he was targeted is because six people connected [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1634.0s)]
*  to the Magnitsky case, as he was, have ended up dead. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1639.68s)]
*  One of them was Boris Nemtsov, a leader of Russia's opposition and Karamurza's partner [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1644.24s)]
*  in lobbying for the Magnitsky Act. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1650.0400000000002s)]
*  On the 27th of February 2015, he was killed by five bullets in the back as he was walking [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1652.48s)]
*  home, as he always did out in the open without bodyguards. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1658.24s)]
*  This was an assassination. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1661.88s)]
*  In some of the deaths, proving there was foul play has been a challenge. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1663.84s)]
*  Take the case of this Russian banker who came forward with incriminating documents related [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1668.94s)]
*  to the Magnitsky case. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1674.56s)]
*  Alexander Perpilichny was a whistleblower. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1676.32s)]
*  At the age of 44, he went jogging outside his home in Surrey, outside of London, and [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1678.74s)]
*  dropped dead. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1684.48s)]
*  The police deemed it an unsuspicious natural death. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1685.64s)]
*  Well, they did look for poison. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1689.0800000000002s)]
*  They just couldn't find any. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1690.6000000000001s)]
*  They did a very first-round toxicology screen. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1691.92s)]
*  They didn't find anything on the first run through. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1695.48s)]
*  Detecting poison can be extremely difficult, and there's a reason. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1698.72s)]
*  This Cold War CIA memo reveals that the Soviets ran a laboratory for poisons in a large and [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1703.0400000000002s)]
*  installation known as the chamber to test undetectable compounds. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1711.16s)]
*  In the case of the banker in London, the coroner wasn't willing to give up. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1717.0400000000002s)]
*  He ordered more tests, and three years later, it was revealed in court that an exotic toxin [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1722.02s)]
*  was found with the help of an authority on flowers. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1728.4s)]
*  A small sample of his stomach contents was sent to a botanical garden outside of London, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1731.92s)]
*  and one of the scientists found a compound called Jelcemian elegans, which is a Chinese [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1739.16s)]
*  herb. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1744.0800000000002s)]
*  They call it the heartbreak grass, and it causes a person to die unexpectedly without [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1745.0800000000002s)]
*  explanation. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1752.6000000000001s)]
*  Still, there's no direct evidence of a Kremlin connection, but the list of those who've come [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1753.6000000000001s)]
*  to die unexpectedly after running afoul of Mr. Putin is long. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1758.96s)]
*  Political opponents and human rights lawyers have been shot. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1764.72s)]
*  Formerly inquisitive reporters have perished in mysterious plane crashes, or by car bombs, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1768.6000000000001s)]
*  by poison, or gunfire. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1774.8400000000001s)]
*  Journalist Anna Polikovskaya was poisoned and shot. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1778.04s)]
*  Then there are enemies who kill themselves, one by hanging, one by stabbing himself to [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1782.44s)]
*  death with two knives, and one by tying himself to a chair and jumping into a swimming pool. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1787.78s)]
*  Some of Putin's opponents are in prison, others forced out of the country, like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1795.24s)]
*  probably Putin's most famous living critic. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1802.1200000000001s)]
*  Are you afraid for your own life? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1805.44s)]
*  For a period of over 10 years, Vladimir Putin had ample opportunity to make a decision about [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1808.4s)]
*  putting an end to my life in a very easy way, just by snapping his fingers. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1813.8s)]
*  And today it's a little bit more difficult. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1819.4s)]
*  Khodorkovsky was once the richest man in Russia until he took to opposing Putin. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1822.16s)]
*  He was put on trial, his oil company confiscated, and then thrown in prison for 10 years. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1828.24s)]
*  Home is now London, where he funds a Russian pro-democracy movement. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1835.0400000000002s)]
*  And this is where the plot thickens, because one of his senior organizers on the ground [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1840.0800000000002s)]
*  in Russia is none other than Vladimir Kara-Murza. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1844.6000000000001s)]
*  There are people who say that what's happened to Kara-Murza is a message to you, a message [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1849.32s)]
*  to you to back off. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1855.72s)]
*  You know, for 10 years I was receiving lots of messages from our authorities of various [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1858.36s)]
*  sorts, and some of these messages were rather unpleasant concerning my physical well-being. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1865.4399999999998s)]
*  But the authorities saw I ignored these messages. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1872.28s)]
*  I would like to believe that they have not forgotten that. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1874.6799999999998s)]
*  In 2015, once Vladimir Kara-Murza was stabilized, he was flown to Washington, D.C., to continue [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1878.04s)]
*  treatment near his wife, Yevgenia, and their three children, who live in the U.S. for their [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1885.0s)]
*  safety. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1890.52s)]
*  But as soon as Kara-Murza got better, he was itching to go back to Russia. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1891.52s)]
*  I think what my husband believes in will always outweigh the fear. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1895.8400000000001s)]
*  Even for you? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1903.0s)]
*  Of course I'm terrified. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1904.08s)]
*  But at the same time, you know, I married the guy 13 years ago, and I knew what I was [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1905.08s)]
*  getting into. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1911.32s)]
*  You know, I think there's nothing better this regime, the Putin regime, would like us to [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1912.32s)]
*  do than to give up and run away. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1916.28s)]
*  And we're not going to give them that pleasure. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1918.4s)]
*  It's our country. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1920.2s)]
*  Even after being poisoned? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1921.2s)]
*  It's our country. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1922.2s)]
*  We have to fight for it. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1923.2s)]
*  He told us this in June. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1924.2s)]
*  He went back immediately after, even though threats against him had intensified, like [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1926.08s)]
*  this video posted on Instagram putting him in the crosshairs of a sniper rifle. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1931.72s)]
*  He was continuing his opposition work when just last month... [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1937.28s)]
*  All of a sudden, he begins experiencing this very elevated heart rate. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1942.4s)]
*  His blood pressure drops very low. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1949.0s)]
*  He begins sweating, and he has trouble breathing. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1951.56s)]
*  His wife thinks her husband was attacked the same way as before. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1956.08s)]
*  The first time, he had been dragged from one hospital to another to yet another while [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1960.62s)]
*  they were trying to establish the cause. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1964.9399999999998s)]
*  This time, he was taken directly to the hospital to the same medical team that had treated [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1967.7399999999998s)]
*  him in 2015. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1972.52s)]
*  And the moment they saw him, they knew what they were dealing with. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1974.3799999999999s)]
*  And what do you think happened? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1978.06s)]
*  The Russian doctor's official diagnosis is an acute intoxication by an undetermined substance, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1979.58s)]
*  which is poisoning. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1986.26s)]
*  This happened just as Washington was raising questions about President Trump's relationship [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1988.42s)]
*  with Mr. Putin. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1992.94s)]
*  So last month, Vladimir Karamurza became an issue on the Senate floor. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1994.28s)]
*  Vladimir has once again paid the price for his gallantry and integrity. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=1999.1000000000001s)]
*  Politicians on both sides of the aisle spoke out against the apparent poisoning, but the [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2004.22s)]
*  Trump administration has not. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2009.3000000000002s)]
*  Remarkably, Karamurza survived again. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2011.9s)]
*  Less than three weeks after he collapsed, he was flown to the U.S., and two weeks later, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2015.26s)]
*  we spoke to him for a second time. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2020.7s)]
*  You look pretty good. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2023.5s)]
*  How are you actually feeling? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2024.5s)]
*  Well, you're very kind. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2025.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't think I feel as good as I look. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2026.8600000000001s)]
*  He said he's recovering faster because his doctors knew just what to do this time. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2028.46s)]
*  The Kremlin has denied any involvement, and since no poison has been found yet, supporters [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2034.22s)]
*  of Putin question whether he was really poisoned at all. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2039.92s)]
*  We've been told that we are very naive, naive journalists, gullible, and that this whole [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2043.86s)]
*  thing is concocted by the opposition to fool the American people into thinking that that [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2051.18s)]
*  regime would do such a thing. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2057.3399999999997s)]
*  To those who say that this is a plot, I honestly, and I mean this sincerely, I wish they never [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2059.74s)]
*  have to experience what I had experienced twice in the last two years. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2064.46s)]
*  When you're trying to breathe and you cannot, when you feel your organs shutting down, giving [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2069.3399999999997s)]
*  up on you one after another, and when you feel the life coming out of your body in the [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2073.12s)]
*  next few hours and you don't remember anything for the next month, and then for the next [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2076.6s)]
*  year you're trying to relearn how to walk, how to use cutlery, how to talk to your kids. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2079.96s)]
*  Again, I wish these people who tell you these things never have to experience this. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2085.3599999999997s)]
*  I honestly, sincerely do. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2088.56s)]
*  You were very, very sick and went back. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2090.52s)]

*  Are you saying I'm not going back anymore? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2096.6s)]
*  Oh, God, no. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2098.2799999999997s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2099.2799999999997s)]
*  First of all, I'm- [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2100.2799999999997s)]
*  You're going to go back? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2101.2799999999997s)]
*  Go back to Russia. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2102.36s)]
*  I'm Russian. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2103.36s)]
*  This is my country. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2104.36s)]
*  And I believe in what I do and what my colleagues do. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2105.36s)]
*  There are many of us. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2107.6400000000003s)]
*  But not many have almost died twice. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2108.6400000000003s)]
*  Many, unfortunately, have died. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2111.76s)]
*  I'm the fortunate one. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2113.8s)]
*  I'm still here. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2114.88s)]
*  I'm still talking to you. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2115.88s)]
*  Many of my colleagues cannot do that. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2116.88s)]
*  Alexei Navalny is the leader of the opposition in Russia who has survived an assassination [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2132.28s)]
*  attempt by poisoning. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2140.2000000000003s)]
*  He's won in a long list of Vladimir Putin's critics who have been victims of unsolved [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2142.36s)]
*  shootings, suspicious suicides, and poisonings. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2147.6000000000004s)]
*  We first met Alexei Navalny three years ago when he was running for president against [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2152.2400000000002s)]
*  Putin. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2157.1200000000003s)]
*  Now Navalny is recuperating in Berlin, where we went this past week after Germany granted [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2158.3599999999997s)]
*  us special permission to travel there despite COVID restrictions. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2164.72s)]
*  When we sat down with Navalny, he told us he was on an airplane on August 20th when [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2169.92s)]
*  he began to feel strange and then very, very sick. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2175.64s)]
*  I said to the flight attendant, and I kind of shocked him with my statement, well, I [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2182.12s)]
*  was poisoned and I'm going to die. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2186.84s)]
*  And I immediately lay down under his feet. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2189.36s)]
*  Alexei Navalny was on a flight to Moscow from Siberia, where he'd been campaigning against [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2192.32s)]
*  Putin's party in a local election when he collapsed with no pain but knowing he was [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2197.92s)]
*  dying. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2204.04s)]
*  Actually, every cell of your body just telling you that's body, we are done. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2205.04s)]
*  One of the other passengers turned on his phone and captured Navalny moaning in anguish. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2211.32s)]
*  The pilot made an emergency landing in Omsk, where medics, thinking Navalny must be a drug [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2219.04s)]
*  addict, administered the usual treatment for an overdose and rushed him to a local hospital, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2224.36s)]
*  where they said he wasn't poisoned but wouldn't let him leave for days. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2230.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, it was a big fight, and they thought that after 48 hours, these poison would be [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2234.96s)]
*  untraceable. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2243.1600000000003s)]
*  And they just keep me there until these 48 hours will be gone. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2244.8s)]
*  Navalny is under constant surveillance. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2251.1200000000003s)]
*  His wife, Yulia, says government agents were at the hospital controlling access to her [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2253.48s)]
*  husband and, she believes, calling the shots. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2258.36s)]
*  At the time, Navalny was in a coma, unaware that his wife, Yulia, was waging a public [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2262.0s)]
*  campaign to encourage Western diplomatic pressure and... [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2268.36s)]
*  Did you write a letter to Putin? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2272.92s)]
*  Yeah, I did it. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2274.6s)]
*  Dear Mr. Putin, free my husband. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2275.84s)]
*  I wrote like I insist that he should do it. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2278.12s)]
*  I demand you free my husband. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2282.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2284.28s)]
*  It was an online campaign, let him out, and Putin thought it would be safe for him. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2285.28s)]
*  Just let me out after 48 hours. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2291.76s)]
*  So after 48 hours, the Russian government allowed him to be flown by air ambulance to [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2294.36s)]
*  a hospital in Berlin known for its experience with victims of poison attacks. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2300.7200000000003s)]
*  And I gather they suspected poison right away? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2306.44s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2309.5600000000004s)]
*  Meanwhile, his team in Siberia searched his hotel room, collecting things Navalny may [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2311.6400000000003s)]
*  like this water bottle, which the doctors in Berlin sent along with a blood sample to [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2317.96s)]
*  a German military lab to see exactly what the poison was. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2323.28s)]
*  And the answer was Novichok. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2328.84s)]
*  They discovered Novichok, this nerve agent, in my blood, inside of body, on my body, and [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2331.12s)]
*  all this bottle from the hotel. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2337.7200000000003s)]
*  So that's why we now we know that I was poisoned in the hotel because I well, it's again, it's [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2341.52s)]
*  just a pure speculation because no one knows what happened exactly. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2347.7599999999998s)]
*  But I think that when I was maybe put some clothes with this poison on me, I touch it [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2353.04s)]
*  with the hand and then I seep from the bottle. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2360.28s)]
*  So this nerve agent was not inside of a bottle, but on the bottle. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2363.28s)]
*  Novichok is a highly toxic nerve agent said to be 10 times more potent than sarin gas. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2367.64s)]
*  Labs in France and Sweden corroborated the finding. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2374.44s)]
*  There's no doubt it was military grade Novichok. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2378.0s)]
*  It's maybe the most toxic agents invented by the humans. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2382.0s)]
*  So it's a new type of Novichok, which prove that unfortunately Putin have a developing [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2388.2799999999997s)]
*  program of these chemical weapons, which is forbidden. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2395.3199999999997s)]
*  The Russians have said that they destroyed all these chemical weapons. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2398.24s)]
*  That's why actually they deny everything because it means that they still have this Novichok. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2402.3599999999997s)]
*  So it means they're not just violating with the keeping it, they are continue to improve it. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2408.3999999999996s)]
*  And there's no doubt that Russia is the only place that where that could have come from. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2414.72s)]
*  This is absolutely correct. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2419.6s)]
*  It's a banned substance. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2421.48s)]
*  It's a banned substance. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2423.3199999999997s)]
*  I think for Putin, why he's using this chemical weapon to do both, kill me and terrify others. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2424.48s)]
*  It's something really scary with the people just drop dead without, there are no gun, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2435.4s)]
*  there are no shots and in a couple of hours you will be dead and without any traces on [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2440.76s)]
*  your body. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2446.12s)]
*  It's something terrifying and Putin is enjoying it. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2447.12s)]
*  You have said you think that Mr. Putin is responsible. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2450.88s)]
*  I don't think I'm sure that he's responsible. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2454.7200000000003s)]
*  Putin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov says the charge is completely baseless and unacceptable. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2458.6800000000003s)]
*  But Angela Merkel of Germany and Emmanuel Macron of France have persuaded the European [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2465.08s)]
*  Union to impose sanctions over this. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2470.56s)]
*  Well, all these leaders have signed on except Donald Trump. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2473.76s)]
*  I have noticed it. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2479.0s)]
*  Is it important to you that he condemn this action? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2481.4s)]
*  So I think it's extremely important that everyone, of course, including and maybe in the first [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2485.52s)]
*  row president of United States to be very against using chemical weapon in the 21st century. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2494.92s)]
*  But why would Putin want to poison Alexei Navalny? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2503.08s)]
*  When we first met Navalny three years ago, he was running against Putin for president. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2507.0s)]
*  He had made a name for himself by getting his hands on incriminating internal financial [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2512.0s)]
*  documents related to high level officials and posting them on a blog. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2516.92s)]
*  Did these documents that you got prove corruption? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2522.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2525.2s)]
*  I work as a whistleblower and I'm not afraid to announce the names. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2526.2s)]
*  He says he found that the Kremlin's inner circle was accumulating vast amounts of wealth [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2531.6s)]
*  and published pictures of multiple homes and yachts. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2537.0s)]
*  He moved on to airing documentaries on YouTube with video of the officials lavish lifestyle. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2540.68s)]
*  And it's something very special about Mr. Putin, that he's crazy about money, personal [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2547.68s)]
*  money, about his family being rich, his friends, like all his people who served with him, with [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2555.0s)]
*  the KGB. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2562.52s)]
*  All of them, they are billionaires. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2563.84s)]
*  That's why fighting corruption means for him that he's fighting me. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2565.68s)]
*  You know, I'm smiling because here you are. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2570.88s)]
*  You have survived the most potent nerve agent there is. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2573.7999999999997s)]
*  And you are as fiery and worked up about Putin and what's going on in this country as you [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2578.32s)]
*  were when I met you a couple of years ago. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2585.52s)]
*  Well, I'm glad. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2587.56s)]
*  I'm glad that I survived. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2590.44s)]
*  His blog inflamed so much outrage in 2017 that tens of thousands of Russians took to [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2591.96s)]
*  the streets against Putin. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2598.4s)]
*  When Navalny called for a second round of protests three months later, he was arrested [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2600.52s)]
*  before he even left his apartment building. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2605.82s)]
*  He's been jailed so many times he's lost count. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2608.96s)]
*  He's been beaten, had green dye with acid splashed in his face. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2612.5s)]
*  And now he can add poisoning to his resume and blame President Putin. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2617.8s)]
*  Well, how can you say that? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2622.6400000000003s)]
*  Why wouldn't it be one of the oligarchs whom you've embarrassed by, as you say, exposing [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2624.2000000000003s)]
*  their corruption? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2629.48s)]
*  Even for oligarch, it's impossible to get this Novichok. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2630.92s)]
*  It's not something you can buy in the store, even if you have millions of billions of dollars. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2633.78s)]
*  Maybe more important, you cannot use it. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2639.6800000000003s)]
*  You will kill yourself and everyone around. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBT49Gb1KvM&t=2642.2200000000003s)]
