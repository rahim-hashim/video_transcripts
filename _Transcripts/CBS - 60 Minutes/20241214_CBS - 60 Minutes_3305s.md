**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [December 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs)
*  The two explosions that tore through the Boston Marathon nearly a year ago were like a starting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=0.0s)]
*  gun on a second race against time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=19.16s)]
*  Unknown terrorists were on the loose, and they had more bombs. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=22.32s)]
*  Now, for the first time, you're going to hear the inside story from the federal investigators [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=26.36s)]
*  who ran the manhunt. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=31.64s)]
*  They led a task force of more than 1,000 federal agents, state police, and Boston cops. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=33.92s)]
*  Tonight, they will speak of the disturbing evidence that cracked the case and of a debate [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=39.96s)]
*  among the investigators that ultimately led to the dragnet's violent end. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  The afternoon of April 15th, the FBI's man in charge of Boston got a text, two large [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=51.24s)]
*  explosions near the finish line. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=57.6s)]
*  For Special Agent Rick DeLaurier, the marathon became a sprint to catch the killers before [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  they struck again. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=66.04s)]
*  I felt that week that I had the weight of the world on my shoulders, and I'm sure I [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=68.48s)]
*  wasn't the only one. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=71.84s)]
*  Did you feel if there was a third bombing it would be on you? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  That's everybody's fear. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=78.2s)]
*  It would be on me. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=79.72s)]
*  It would be on the Joint Terrorism Task Force. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=81.4s)]
*  But that wasn't what drove us. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=85.44s)]
*  What drove us is preventing more people from getting hurt. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=87.08s)]
*  Two hundred and sixty-four were hurt already, three killed. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=89.92s)]
*  Moments before, Rick DeLaurier had been counting the days to retirement, 26 years at the FBI. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=94.88s)]
*  Now, on Boylston Street, he took over the biggest investigation of his life. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  It was a scene of devastation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=106.64s)]
*  There was evidence everywhere. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=108.64s)]
*  And you said what to yourself in that moment? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=110.56s)]
*  I said we will find those responsible for these despicable crimes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=112.76s)]
*  FBI Director Robert Mueller ordered every office in the world to back up DeLaurier. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=116.16s)]
*  DeLaurier's link to headquarters was Executive Assistant Director Stephanie Douglas. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=121.88s)]
*  We were very, very concerned about other bombs in Boston, but we had to think beyond that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=126.92s)]
*  Were there other bombs in other cities? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=131.88s)]
*  Were U.S. interests even abroad at risk? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=134.16s)]
*  So we had to consider everything. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=137.56s)]
*  We could not eliminate anything. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=139.76s)]
*  First came the crime scene. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=141.88s)]
*  Twelve blocks of debris, abandoned backpacks, and bomb parts blown to smithereens. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  They set up a grid pattern. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=150.2s)]
*  Evidence could be on windowsills. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=151.86s)]
*  Evidence could be on roofs of buildings. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=153.52s)]
*  Evidence could be anywhere. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=155.72s)]
*  Are they going down the street with tweezers? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=156.72s)]
*  Sometimes when they need to, they're doing that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=158.76s)]
*  But yes, they're very carefully picking up everything they see. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=161.98000000000002s)]
*  They saw a battery pack for model cars and chunks of two pressure cookers. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=166.76s)]
*  The cookers concentrate the explosion for maximum force. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=172.16s)]
*  You decided to set up a warehouse near Logan Airport. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=175.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  Everything swept from the street was processed in this 46,000 square foot warehouse. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  Twice a day, a plane flew the items to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  And you basically have almost like an assembly line of evidence. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=190.84s)]
*  So it gets tagged. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=194.72s)]
*  It gets recorded as evidence so that you're preserving that chain of custody. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=195.8s)]
*  But it also, for all the different parts and components, that would later go to recreating [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=201.68s)]
*  the devices themselves. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=206.48s)]
*  The bombs? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=208.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=209.28s)]
*  Recreating the bombs? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=210.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=211.28s)]
*  From the pieces that you found? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=212.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=213.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=214.28s)]
*  Successful as that was, it turned out the evidence that would solve the case had been [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=215.28s)]
*  collected before the first bomb exploded that Monday. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=219.64s)]
*  The FBI could travel back in time through the lenses of dozens of security cameras up [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=224.12s)]
*  and down Boylston. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=230.0s)]
*  Almost 13,000 different videos were obtained and 120,000, actually more than 120,000 still [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=231.88s)]
*  photographs. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  At the FBI lab in Virginia, 120 analysts were searching video feeds from Boston. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  What are you looking for? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=246.84s)]
*  Somebody who just doesn't look similar to others in a crowd who would be watching a [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  race. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=253.2s)]
*  Was there a eureka moment in terms of the video? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=254.32s)]
*  At some point somebody said, hey boss, have a look at this. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=258.12s)]
*  Yes, there was. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=260.88s)]
*  It was, I believe, a Wednesday morning. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=262.0s)]
*  And we watched that video hundreds and hundreds of times. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=264.36s)]
*  You can see an individual, a tall man wearing a white ball cap, walk into the frame. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=267.46s)]
*  He has a backpack slung over one of his shoulders. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=276.96s)]
*  He puts the backpack down very nonchalantly. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=280.66s)]
*  He joins the crowd. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=283.22s)]
*  You clearly see everybody look very, very definitely to the left, like they've heard [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=284.88s)]
*  something, they've seen something. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=290.18s)]
*  So, you know that first blast has gone off. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=291.34000000000003s)]
*  He does not do that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=294.26s)]
*  He does not do what everybody else in that video does. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=295.54s)]
*  He does not turn to his left. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=298.46s)]
*  He instead just stands there for a second or two and walks very deliberately back the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=300.32s)]
*  same direction that he came in. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=307.74s)]
*  The eureka video hasn't been seen by the public. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=309.42s)]
*  It is being kept for the trial. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=312.38s)]
*  But this still photo shows much the same view of the suspect and the people who would be [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=314.82s)]
*  torn apart by the blast. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=320.24s)]
*  Let me ask you to describe what you see in that picture. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=322.26s)]
*  I see the subject, the individual who has been charged in investigation. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=331.1s)]
*  And I see people who were grievously, who were grievously injured in that blast. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=335.14s)]
*  And I see individuals who died in that blast. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=338.66s)]
*  The people along the fence line there? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=341.18s)]
*  Several of them, yes. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=343.46s)]
*  A very, very emotional time when I look at that to know what happened a few moments afterwards. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=344.46s)]
*  I believe I see his backpack on the ground and then I see one of the people that was [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=350.26s)]
*  killed as a result of that bomb. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=357.62s)]
*  Do you know their name? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=359.38s)]
*  This is Martin Richard. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=362.34s)]
*  Martin Richard was eight years old. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=364.5s)]
*  His seven-year-old sister Jane lost a leg. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=366.92s)]
*  Their father Bill suffered hearing damage from the bomb in the backpack laid at their [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=370.16s)]
*  feet. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  In the video, the backpack explodes 20 seconds after the man in the white hat walks away. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=376.64000000000004s)]
*  Stephanie Douglas saw it in the FBI's Washington Command Center. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=382.6s)]
*  Nobody I've talked to can quite find the words. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=386.44s)]
*  It's a horrible video to watch. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=393.32s)]
*  I mean, after you, after the bomb goes off, obviously, it's a very smoky situation. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=394.84s)]
*  There's a lot of smoke and the smoke clears. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=403.2s)]
*  And what you saw is a very happy scene of people watching that marathon is no longer [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=414.28s)]
*  Even after seeing something so horrible, I remember the survivor who, unfortunately, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=415.28s)]
*  his clothes were on fire. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=423.12s)]
*  And I just remember this police officer getting down on his hands and knees and putting out [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=424.48s)]
*  the flames on this person with his bare hands. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=430.44s)]
*  And I just thought to myself, you know, what an incredible contrast of events. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=435.0s)]
*  Something so horrific, and then we have this person with no thought or of his own comfort [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=441.72s)]
*  to himself, Russian, and actually do something like that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=450.64s)]
*  That was so brave. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=454.67999999999995s)]
*  I still remember that very clearly. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=456.11999999999995s)]
*  Only two days had passed. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=459.2s)]
*  Now they were looking for every image of the suspect they called White Hat. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=460.76s)]
*  Massachusetts state police analysts found him with a man in a black hat. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=464.88s)]
*  Which turned out to be his older brother. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=471.47999999999996s)]
*  Now you have the Sarnayev brothers. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=473.47999999999996s)]
*  But you don't know that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=474.47999999999996s)]
*  No, I don't know that. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  I don't know who they are. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  Then, suddenly that Wednesday, confusion reigned when cable news channels erroneously reported [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  that a suspect had been arrested and was headed to the courthouse. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=483.8s)]
*  The error caused pandemonium, according to U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, who's leading [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=488.36s)]
*  the prosecution. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=493.0s)]
*  And I remember turning to my colleague and saying, to my press person saying, do we have [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=494.56s)]
*  someone in custody? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=500.28000000000003s)]
*  And I turned to Rick, to Laurie, do we have someone in custody? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  And they were like, no, we don't have anyone in custody. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  I think that kind of misinformation makes it appear as if government isn't in control. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=507.20000000000005s)]
*  The investigation is sort of, you know, confusing. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=511.64000000000004s)]
*  And so it can be very, very harmful. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=514.96s)]
*  More harm was done the next morning when the New York Post added to the erroneous reporting [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=517.2s)]
*  by putting a man with a white hat on its front page. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=522.36s)]
*  Only problem was, wasn't the right man in the white hat. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=526.08s)]
*  That generated tremendous risk and harm. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=529.1600000000001s)]
*  It gives people false sense of security, thinking, oh, they've identified these suspects. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=532.0s)]
*  And it turns out that it's wrong individuals. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=537.02s)]
*  It puts those individuals at tremendous risk. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=539.92s)]
*  The risk to the innocent lent urgency to the debate over whether to release the real pictures. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=542.9s)]
*  Why wouldn't you release the pictures to the public? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=549.66s)]
*  Isn't that the fastest way to find the perpetrators? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=552.62s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=555.98s)]
*  But it's also gives them every opportunity to escape. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=558.42s)]
*  Remember, we do not have the identities of anybody. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=562.02s)]
*  So your concern was that if you put the pictures out there to the public, they'd know they'd [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=565.26s)]
*  been had and they'd run. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=571.14s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=573.3s)]
*  The contravailing argument is you had individuals, we had photographic evidence of individuals [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=574.62s)]
*  who we strongly believed were responsible for the bombings and we needed to identify [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=580.06s)]
*  them as quickly as possible. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=584.9s)]
*  So Thursday, Rick Deloria walked out in time for the evening news. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=586.66s)]
*  These images should be the only ones. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=592.16s)]
*  I emphasize the only ones that the public should view to assist us. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=593.78s)]
*  The pictures set events in motion that Deloria didn't predict, in fact, didn't recognize [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=598.42s)]
*  even after they started. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=604.02s)]
*  My wife was watching the news that evening. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=605.6999999999999s)]
*  An officer has been shot. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=607.54s)]
*  And there was a story about an MIT police officer who was subsequently identified as [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=610.5799999999999s)]
*  Officer Sean Collier, who had been murdered that evening and right on campus. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=614.38s)]
*  My wife looked at me and she said, I bet those are your guys and they're on the run [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=619.5s)]
*  right now and I bet they've murdered this police officer. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=624.3s)]
*  And I didn't believe her. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=627.26s)]
*  I said, oh, no, I don't think so. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=628.42s)]
*  And I went to bed. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=630.02s)]
*  Your wife had cracked the case and you went to bed. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=631.14s)]
*  I did not believe that she had cracked the case at the time. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=634.1s)]
*  I went to bed. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=636.58s)]
*  I went to bed probably around 10 o'clock. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=637.58s)]
*  And this is probably a sad commentary in my life, but my blackberry was on the pillow [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=641.04s)]
*  next to me. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=645.86s)]
*  And somewhere around 1230, quarter to 1 in the morning, I received a phone call from [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=646.9s)]
*  one of my assistant special agents in charge, Jeff Sillett. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=651.66s)]
*  And my phone rang about a little after 1 in the morning. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=654.98s)]
*  I woke her out of a sound sleep and I said, an MIT police officer has been murdered earlier [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=659.7s)]
*  this evening by individuals we believe to be responsible for the bombing. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=664.34s)]
*  And they are on the streets of Watertown right now engaged in a shootout with the Watertown [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=669.0600000000001s)]
*  Police Department. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=673.46s)]
*  It was combat. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=682.9000000000001s)]
*  Two suspects threw pipe bombs and a pressure cooker bomb at the police. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=684.3000000000001s)]
*  An officer was gravely wounded. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=688.38s)]
*  Those who argued that releasing the pictures would cause the suspects to run were right. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=690.96s)]
*  Was putting the pictures out the right call? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=696.94s)]
*  Yes, I think at the end of the day, we really had no choice. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=698.82s)]
*  Believe me, the death of Sean Collier is not lost on the FBI. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=702.38s)]
*  We consider it an incredibly tragic event. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=705.54s)]
*  But I think at the end of the day, given the facts as we knew them at the time, we made [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=709.22s)]
*  the best decision. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=713.86s)]
*  How do you feel about that decision now? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=715.86s)]
*  I stand by that decision, Scott. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=717.9s)]
*  Nobody could have reasonably foreseen that a police officer would be murdered. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=719.9s)]
*  What could reasonably be foreseen is that these individuals could have had more bombs, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=725.26s)]
*  could have set those bombs off and caused carnage similar or even greater to what they [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=731.26s)]
*  caused on April 15th. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=737.58s)]
*  One suspect was killed, the other vanished. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=741.62s)]
*  In minutes, the FBI matched the dead man's fingerprints to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, an immigrant [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=744.42s)]
*  from Kyrgyzstan. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=750.7s)]
*  Other records showed he had a brother. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=752.46s)]
*  Yeah, and I remember that so clearly. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=754.7s)]
*  Somebody walking in with a Manila folder and said, okay, here's his brother. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=756.66s)]
*  And they opened it and it's this picture. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=760.22s)]
*  And I go, that's him. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=763.74s)]
*  That's Whitehat. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=764.74s)]
*  That's who we should be looking for. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=765.74s)]
*  Friday, the governor ordered a lockdown of Boston, but a house to house search turned [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=767.82s)]
*  up nothing. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=772.94s)]
*  Everybody's exhausted and deflated. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=773.94s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's a very sad day for Boston, another sad day for Boston. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=777.5s)]
*  But then a man noticed someone in a boat in his backyard. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=781.86s)]
*  Jokhar Tsarnaev was wounded but alive. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=787.1s)]
*  What did you think as he went into court to be arraigned? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=790.9000000000001s)]
*  He had a smug grin on his face much of the time in the courtroom. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=793.7600000000001s)]
*  He would glance over his right shoulder back to his relatives and smile and smirk at them. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=797.7800000000001s)]
*  And I found that absolutely galling and I found it reprehensible. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=803.0200000000001s)]
*  The attorney general has decided to seek the death penalty in this case. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=807.9000000000001s)]
*  Yes, he has. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=811.94s)]
*  And I support that decision. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=814.1s)]
*  Jokhar Tsarnaev has pled not guilty. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=817.2600000000001s)]
*  His defense team declined to speak with us. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=819.86s)]
*  U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz is preparing for a November trial. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=822.4200000000001s)]
*  The notorious narco known as El Chapo has achieved one of his greatest aspirations. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=846.94s)]
*  He's the most famous drug lord of all time. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=852.5400000000001s)]
*  This is our fourth 60-minute story about El Chapo whose real name is Joaquin Guzman. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=855.86s)]
*  Our first story came when he was captured after 13 years on the run. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=861.7800000000001s)]
*  We told you then that El Chapo, Spanish for shorty, was a drug lord. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=866.6600000000001s)]
*  And most of all for his daring getaways, like the one we told you about last year, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=872.7s)]
*  when he vanished from a maximum security Mexican prison through one of his trademark escape tunnels. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=877.4200000000001s)]
*  Then there was our interview with actor Sean Penn, who met Guzman at a high-profile prison. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=883.22s)]
*  He was a very famous drug lord and he was a very famous drug lord. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=889.1s)]
*  He was a very famous drug lord and he was a very famous drug lord. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=893.1s)]
*  Then there was our interview with actor Sean Penn, who met Guzman at a hideaway last fall. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=897.7s)]
*  After El Chapo's stunning prison break, many thought he'd never get caught again. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=903.82s)]
*  But he was. How? You're about to see. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=909.02s)]
*  Where in the pantheon of drug traffickers, drug lords, does El Chapo fall? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=914.38s)]
*  El Chapo resides at the very top of that hierarchy. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=922.78s)]
*  Peter Vincent was a senior official and legal adviser of both the Justice Department and Homeland Security [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=927.1800000000001s)]
*  during the international manhunt for Guzman. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=933.5s)]
*  He says after the daring escape last summer, El Chapo became almost delusional. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=936.42s)]
*  So what precipitated his downfall? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=942.74s)]
*  He became drunk on his own wine. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=945.94s)]
*  He started to believe the hype, that he was special, that he was almost a demigod, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=949.74s)]
*  that he was something truly magical. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=955.86s)]
*  And he became so incredibly arrogant that he thought he was untouchable. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=960.7s)]
*  Jim Dinkins agrees. As chief of Homeland Security Investigations, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=966.26s)]
*  he was part of the US-Mexico task force that nabbed El Chapo in 2014. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=971.26s)]
*  He knew how he was captured last time. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=977.98s)]
*  And so he had the upper hand, right? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=981.22s)]
*  He had all the cards in his hand to go off into the sunset and to learn from his mistake. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=983.0600000000001s)]
*  But he just couldn't help himself. And he remained in the public eye. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=988.34s)]
*  After his first escape from prison in 2001, Guzman virtually disappeared from sight for 13 years, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=992.62s)]
*  but not this time. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1000.62s)]
*  Here he gets out of prison and he's on the road being spotted at this place having drinks [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1002.54s)]
*  and this place with his family members. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1009.22s)]
*  He invited Sean Penn and the actress Kate Del Castillo to come in to see him. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1012.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1018.42s)]
*  Did Mexican law enforcement know that these two actors were going in to see El Chapo? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1019.42s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. They knew where Sean was going to go, when he was going to land. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1025.7s)]
*  They knew right away. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1030.3s)]
*  How did they know? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1031.94s)]
*  Because they were listening in on the cartel's communications and watching. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1033.3400000000001s)]
*  Mexican and US law enforcement reformed the task force that caught El Chapo the last time. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1038.66s)]
*  They were tracking not just Guzman, but everyone in his inner circle, including his cook [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1045.1000000000001s)]
*  and everyone his lieutenants contacted, including Sean Penn. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1051.02s)]
*  Did he become sloppy? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1055.46s)]
*  Definitely. There was more sightings of him in the last six months [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1056.8600000000001s)]
*  than there was in the last 10 years before he was captured in 2014. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1060.1s)]
*  After he escaped the last time, you told us that you were not confident that he would [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1063.98s)]
*  ever be captured again. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1069.06s)]
*  That El Chapo had become a smarter criminal. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1071.7s)]
*  Did you overestimate his intelligence? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1075.6599999999999s)]
*  I truly did. Here he had over a year in prison. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1077.6599999999999s)]
*  I presumed he was using that same amount of time to think about how he was going to remain [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1081.34s)]
*  a fugitive for the rest of his life. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1085.1399999999999s)]
*  Mexican officials told us that only 20 days after his escape, the Marines had picked up [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1087.54s)]
*  on Guzman's trail. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1092.9s)]
*  They created an even smaller team of Mexican Marines, a search block, and they focused [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1094.78s)]
*  on the prize at hand, and that was capturing El Chapo Guzman alive if they absolutely could. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1099.74s)]
*  Their first opportunity came in early October, just days after Sean Penn's visit. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1106.1s)]
*  The Marines told us they waited because they didn't want the American actor caught in the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1111.66s)]
*  crossfire. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1116.5s)]
*  A team of Marines approached one of El Chapo's mountaintop ranches by Jungle Road, while [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1117.5s)]
*  another group of commandos flew in by helicopter. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1123.38s)]
*  So what went wrong on that October mission? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1127.54s)]
*  As I understand it, despite all of El Chapo Guzman's bravado of being a macho, very powerful [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1131.54s)]
*  man, he was running with a child in his arms. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1138.34s)]
*  A human shield, a baby as a shield? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1141.14s)]
*  That's the only way that one can rationally see it. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1144.14s)]
*  So once again, El Chapo got away. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1148.5s)]
*  In early December, intelligence led the Marines to this house in the sleepy coastal town of [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1152.0200000000002s)]
*  Los Mochis in northern Sinaloa. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1157.66s)]
*  Wiretap Intercepts talked about a visit planned by Grandma and Aunt, code names for El Chapo [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1160.74s)]
*  and his lieutenant known as Cholo Ivan. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1167.42s)]
*  The Marines watched the house for a month as painters and construction crews came and [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1171.5s)]
*  went. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1176.58s)]
*  Then, on the morning of Thursday, January 7th, Grandma finally showed up. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1177.58s)]
*  An assault force quickly moved into position nearby. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1183.66s)]
*  That evening, someone in the house called out for a large order of tacos and this armored [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1187.78s)]
*  truck left to go pick up the food. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1193.4s)]
*  Chapo was having a party. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1195.94s)]
*  For an incredibly savvy, clever, almost a criminal genius that El Chapo Guzman was, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1198.6599999999999s)]
*  he ultimately was done in by very simple tastes. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1206.46s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1209.6999999999998s)]
*  Tacos, tequila and chicas. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1210.6999999999998s)]
*  At 4.40 a.m. in the pre-dawn hours of Friday, January 8th, the Marines began battering down [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1216.4199999999998s)]
*  the gate of Chapo's safe house. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1223.54s)]
*  We've concealed the identities of the commando leaders for their safety. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1226.18s)]
*  So when we first knocked on the door of the house, the shooting started. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1233.8200000000002s)]
*  A fierce gun battle erupted. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1239.46s)]
*  The first Marine through the door was shot in the arm. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1244.42s)]
*  I watched the videotape. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1248.46s)]
*  It's very intense. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1250.22s)]
*  Chapo's people inside the house were firing high caliber rounds, grenades, so it was like [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1255.1399999999999s)]
*  a war zone. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1260.06s)]
*  The Marines moved methodically through the house. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1265.5s)]
*  Chapo's henchmen retreated up the stairs. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1270.6599999999999s)]
*  Just inside the door, one gunman lay dead. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1273.86s)]
*  Down the hall, four more taken prisoner and the commandos quickly check a walk-in closet [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1277.78s)]
*  covered with full-length mirrors. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1283.3s)]
*  Upstairs, the Marines find two women, one of them the cook, cowering on the bathroom [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1285.9s)]
*  floor. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1291.82s)]
*  Outside the house, more commandos fought it out with gunmen who fled across the rooftops. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1293.22s)]
*  When it was over, there were five cartel members dead and six in custody. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1299.66s)]
*  But once again, Chapo, with Cholo Ivan, had vanished. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1305.14s)]
*  A couple of days later, the Marines took us to the safe house in Los Moches in an armed [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1310.46s)]
*  convoy. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1315.6200000000001s)]
*  Here, just inside the gate, a pool of blood where the Marine was shot. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1316.6200000000001s)]
*  And inside the door, more blood stains. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1323.74s)]
*  The walls pockmarked with bullet holes and the scars of exploding shrapnel. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1326.54s)]
*  And remember that walk-in closet? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1331.54s)]
*  The mirrors masked a hidden door. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1333.74s)]
*  Behind the secret door, the entrance to one of El Chapo's trademark tunnels. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1336.74s)]
*  It's connected to a network of storm drains and sewers. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1341.78s)]
*  It was 45 minutes before they found El Chapo's escape route. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1346.14s)]
*  That morning, the Marines gave chase. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1350.7s)]
*  We intensified the search inside the tunnels, opening manhole covers and inserting people [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1354.06s)]
*  into the sewers. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1360.46s)]
*  Then, it started raining. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1361.6200000000001s)]
*  Hard. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1363.94s)]
*  After 20 minutes of rain, we thought that Chapo might drown in the sewers because of [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1367.7s)]
*  the high level of the water. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1372.74s)]
*  So he popped up out of the manhole right in the middle of a busy street. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1374.7s)]
*  That was his only option. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1381.98s)]
*  So this is where he came out. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1383.94s)]
*  He popped out of this manhole cover, which is about a half mile from the house, straight [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1385.8600000000001s)]
*  down the road there. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1390.06s)]
*  Look carefully at this security camera footage from the gas station across the street. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1392.1399999999999s)]
*  At 8.55 a.m., four hours after the first shots were exchanged, right there, you can see Chapo [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1397.1s)]
*  and Cholo Ivan climbing out of the sewer. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1403.94s)]
*  And then, in this cell phone video, you can see them car-jack a white VW Jetta and speed [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1407.5s)]
*  away. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1413.4199999999998s)]
*  The fugitives got only three blocks before the Jetta broke down. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1414.6799999999998s)]
*  So they jacked a second car, a red Ford Focus. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1419.06s)]
*  But only a couple of miles out of town, that car broke down. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1423.06s)]
*  Within minutes, the Federal Emergency Center got two reports of hijacked vehicles. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1427.6599999999999s)]
*  On the highway out of town, the Marines found the Ford already on the bed of a tow truck, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1432.98s)]
*  but no sign of Chapo and his lieutenant. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1438.94s)]
*  They had been picked up by the federal police and taken to a nearby motel. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1441.86s)]
*  What were they doing in the backseat of the police car? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1447.1399999999999s)]
*  They weren't talking. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1451.74s)]
*  They were relaxed, but they looked confused. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1453.02s)]
*  No one knows why the federal police took Chapo to the motel instead of to jail, but Peter [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1456.26s)]
*  Vincent has a theory. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1462.3999999999999s)]
*  El Chapo undoubtedly said, one, you let me go now and I will make you wealthier beyond [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1464.4599999999998s)]
*  your wild imaginations. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1471.78s)]
*  If you should choose to decline my most generous offer, I am not only going to kill you, but [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1474.38s)]
*  I am going to rape and kill your wife and your daughters and I'm going to torture your [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1482.9s)]
*  sons. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1488.7s)]
*  He has behaved like that in the past. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1489.7s)]
*  He has behaved like that virtually his entire criminal career. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1491.5s)]
*  Bribes and threats. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1495.7800000000002s)]
*  Bribes and threats. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1496.96s)]
*  Bribes and bullets. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1498.94s)]
*  Luckily, the Mexican Marines showed up, realized what was going on and took control of the [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1500.78s)]
*  situation. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1509.3799999999999s)]
*  Chapo was flown to Mexico City for booking. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1510.86s)]
*  He was paraded before reporters and returned to Altiplano, the same prison from which he [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1513.66s)]
*  had escaped last July. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1518.94s)]
*  This time he is rotated from cell to cell to cell. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1521.22s)]
*  Guards are circulated every 15 minutes through whatever cell he happens to be occupying on [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1526.78s)]
*  that particular day. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1533.46s)]
*  The U.S. Justice Department once Guzman extradited, brought here to face charges for his crimes. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1535.36s)]
*  Seven separate jurisdictions, including New York, Chicago and San Diego, all want to put [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1541.74s)]
*  El Chapo on trial. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1547.54s)]
*  Juan Pedro Bedillo is a lawyer who only has one client, El Chapo. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1550.06s)]
*  He warns extradition can be a lengthy process. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1555.78s)]
*  How long do you think the whole extradition legal proceedings will go on? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1560.08s)]
*  Ten, fifteen, twenty years perhaps. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1567.18s)]
*  Or it could be one or two years. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1571.18s)]
*  El Chapo Guzman knows that if he is ultimately extradited to the United States, it's essentially [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1573.46s)]

*  Really? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1846.02s)]
*  A few of them. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1847.02s)]
*  I had to remind them, gently remind them who Whitey Bulger was. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1848.02s)]
*  That he was number one on the FBI's most wanted list. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1850.98s)]
*  Number one. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1853.3s)]
*  Number one, yeah. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1854.3s)]
*  Big East Coast figure, but in the West Coast not so much. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1855.3s)]
*  The Cuffs in L.A. were focused on gang bangers and cartel members, not some retired Irish [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1859.58s)]
*  mobster who hadn't been spotted in 16 years. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1864.7s)]
*  But then few mobsters have ever been as infamous in the city as Whitey Bulger was in Boston, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1868.56s)]
*  and his reputation was for more than just being grumpy. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1874.22s)]
*  Besides extortion and flooding the city with cocaine, Bulger routinely performed or ordered [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1877.6599999999999s)]
*  executions. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1883.22s)]
*  Some at close range, some with a hail of bullets, and at least one by strangulation, after which [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1884.74s)]
*  it's said he took a nap. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1890.42s)]
*  The special agent Rich Tien, who ran the FBI's Whitey Bulger Fugitive Task Force, had heard [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1891.98s)]
*  it all. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1897.3s)]

*  He was charged with other crimes. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1900.8600000000001s)]
*  He was a scourge to the society in South Boston, his own community. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1902.94s)]
*  He was also a scourge to the FBI and a great source of embarrassment to Tien, Special Agent [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1908.3s)]
*  Phil Torsny, and others on the FBI task force. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1913.9s)]
*  Years earlier, Whitey Bulger had infiltrated the Boston office of the FBI and bought off [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1917.98s)]
*  agents who protected him and plied him with information, including the tip that allowed [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1923.18s)]
*  Bulger to flee just days before he was to be indicted. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1928.18s)]
*  We really had to catch this guy to establish credibility after all the other issues, and [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1931.42s)]
*  it was just a matter of bringing this guy back to Boston to make sure this guy didn't [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1937.66s)]
*  die or get away with this thing. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1941.02s)]
*  Torsny, who's now retired and agent Tommy McDonald, joined the task force in 2009. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1945.0600000000002s)]
*  The joke was Bulger was on the FBI's least wanted list. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1951.0600000000002s)]
*  There hadn't been a credible lead in more than a decade, and their efforts in Bulger's [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1954.94s)]
*  old neighborhood of South Boston were met with mistrust and ridicule. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1958.94s)]
*  Some people, they told us right out front, you guys aren't looking for that guy. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1963.24s)]
*  People just made the assumption we had him stashed somewhere. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1966.8s)]
*  People really thought that kind of thing. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1969.72s)]
*  Despite that mindset that we're not going to help you, the FBI still got it done. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1971.6399999999999s)]
*  It took 16 years. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1976.9199999999998s)]
*  Took 16 years. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1978.56s)]
*  Yeah, this was not a typical fugitive. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1979.56s)]
*  The FBI says Bulger had planned his getaway years in advance, with money set aside and [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1982.48s)]
*  a fake identity for a Thomas Baxter. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1987.6s)]
*  During his first two years on the lam, Bulger was in touch with friends and family, shuttling [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1991.0s)]
*  between New York, Chicago and the resort town of Grand Isle, Louisiana, where he rented [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=1995.8799999999999s)]
*  a home until his identity was compromised. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2001.6399999999999s)]
*  After that, it seemed as if Bulger had disappeared from the face of the earth, except for the [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2005.08s)]
*  alleged sightings all over the world. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2009.56s)]
*  How many of these tips do you think might have been true? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2012.24s)]
*  There was thousands and thousands of tips, and I think, I don't think any of them are [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2015.72s)]
*  true. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2021.36s)]
*  One of the obstacles was there were really no good photographs of Bulger or his longtime [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2022.64s)]
*  live-in girlfriend, Catherine Gregg, a former dental hygienist. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2027.6000000000001s)]
*  The FBI often noted that the couple shared a love of animals, especially dogs and cats, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2032.0800000000002s)]
*  and asked veterinarians to be on the lookout. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2037.68s)]
*  There were reports that Gregg once had breast implants and other plastic surgery in Boston, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2040.5s)]
*  so the task force reached out to physicians. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2045.8600000000001s)]
*  Eventually they got a call from a Dr. Mathias Donnellan, who had located her files in storage. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2048.7599999999998s)]
*  I was trying to leave the office a little early to catch one of my kids' ball games, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2054.52s)]
*  and I said, well listen, I'm going to swing by in the morning and pick those up. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2058.16s)]
*  And they said to me, do you want the photos too? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2062.36s)]
*  And I said, you have photos? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2066.04s)]
*  And they said, yeah, we have photos. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2067.04s)]
*  And I said, we'll be there in 15 minutes. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2068.52s)]
*  The breast implant lead produced a treasure trove of high-resolution Catherine Gregg photographs [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2071.12s)]
*  that would help crack the case. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2076.92s)]
*  The FBI decided to switch strategies, going after the girlfriend in order to catch the gangster. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2078.88s)]
*  This is an announcement by the FBI. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2084.36s)]
*  The FBI created this public service announcement. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2087.48s)]
*  60-year-old Gregg is the girlfriend of 81-year-old Bulger. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2090.2400000000002s)]
*  It ran in 14 markets on daytime talk shows aimed at women. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2093.6200000000003s)]
*  Call the tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2097.2000000000003s)]
*  And it didn't take long. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2101.0s)]
*  The very next morning, the Bulger task force got three messages from someone that used [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2102.44s)]
*  to live in Santa Monica and was 100% certain that Charlie and Carol Gasco, apartment 303 [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2106.88s)]
*  at the Princess Eugenia Apartments, were the people they were looking for. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2114.12s)]
*  The descriptions and the age difference matched, and Deputy U.S. Marshal Neil Sullivan, who [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2118.28s)]
*  handled the lead, said there was another piece of tantalizing information. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2123.0s)]
*  The tipster specifically described that they were caring for this cat and their love for [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2127.32s)]
*  this cat. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2132.32s)]
*  So that was just one piece of the puzzle and the tip that just added up to saying if this [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2133.32s)]
*  isn't them, it's something we better check out immediately because it sure sounds like [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2137.92s)]
*  them. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2142.4s)]
*  A search of the FBI's computer database for the Gascoes raised another red flag, not for [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2143.4s)]
*  what it found, but for what it didn't. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2148.6800000000003s)]
*  Basically, like they were ghosts. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2151.0s)]
*  No driver's license. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2152.6800000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2153.6800000000003s)]
*  No driver's license, no California ID, like they didn't exist. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2154.6800000000003s)]
*  That's the apartment. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2158.52s)]
*  That corner on the third floor. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2159.52s)]
*  On the right-hand side? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2161.0800000000004s)]
*  By early afternoon, FBI agent Scott Garriola had set up a number of surveillance posts [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2162.64s)]
*  and had already met with apartment manager Josh Bond to talk about his tenants. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2167.88s)]
*  He closed the door, threw down a folder and opened it up and said are these the people [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2172.48s)]
*  that live in apartment 303? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2176.84s)]
*  Did you say anything when you saw the pictures? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2180.0s)]
*  My initial reaction was holy s**t. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2182.3199999999997s)]
*  You're living next door to a gangster. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2184.68s)]
*  I still didn't really know who he was. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2186.3199999999997s)]
*  But it didn't take him long to figure it out. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2189.08s)]
*  While the FBI was mulling its options, Bond logged on to Bolger's Wikipedia page. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2191.2s)]
*  I'm kind of scrolling down and it's like oh wow, this guy is serious. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2195.88s)]
*  It's like murders and extortion and then I get to the bottom and there's this thing, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2199.48s)]
*  it's like from one of his old people saying well the last time I saw him he said you know [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2204.48s)]
*  when he goes out he's going to have guns and he's going to be ready to take people with [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2209.2s)]
*  him. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2213.04s)]
*  I was like ooh, maybe I shouldn't be involved in this. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2214.04s)]
*  We were sitting here laughing about it but he's a pretty serious guy. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2216.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2220.08s)]
*  He killed a lot of people. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2221.08s)]
*  True. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2222.36s)]
*  Or had them killed. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2223.36s)]
*  I didn't know that at the time. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2224.36s)]
*  Bond told the FBI he wasn't going to knock on the Gasco's door because there was a note [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2225.92s)]
*  posted expressly asking people not to bother them. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2230.52s)]
*  Carroll had told neighbors that Charlie was showing signs of dementia. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2234.2s)]
*  So we were back there. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2237.88s)]
*  So Garriola devised a ruse involving the Gasco's storage locker in the garage. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2239.46s)]
*  Had the name Gasco across it and apartment 303. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2244.92s)]
*  He had the manager call to tell them that their locker had been broken into and that [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2248.52s)]
*  he needed someone to come down to see if anything was missing. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2252.7200000000003s)]
*  Carroll Gasco said her husband would be right down. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2256.12s)]
*  We just rushed him. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2259.16s)]
*  You mean guns out, FBI don't move? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2260.16s)]
*  Sure. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2262.32s)]
*  Gave the words hey, FBI, get your hands up. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2263.32s)]
*  Hands went up right away and then at that moment we told him to get down on his knees [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2266.36s)]
*  And he gave us, yeah, he gave us a I ain't getting down on my effing knees. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2270.48s)]
*  Didn't want to get his pants dirty. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2275.3999999999996s)]
*  Didn't want to get his pants dirty. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2276.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, wearing white and seeing the oil on the ground, I guess he didn't want to get [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2277.3999999999996s)]
*  down in oil. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2281.2s)]
*  Even at 81, this was a man used to being in control. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2282.48s)]
*  I asked him to identify himself and that didn't go over well. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2285.96s)]
*  He asked me to effing identify myself, which I did. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2289.12s)]
*  And I asked him, I said, are you, are you Whitey Bulger? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2293.08s)]
*  He said yes. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2295.8399999999997s)]
*  Just about that moment, someone catches my attention from a few feet away by the elevator [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2297.04s)]
*  shaft. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2301.16s)]
*  It was Janice Goodwin from the third floor coming to do her laundry. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2302.16s)]
*  And I said, excuse me, I think I can help you. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2305.68s)]
*  This man has dementia. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2308.36s)]
*  So if he's acting oddly, you know, that could be why. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2309.36s)]
*  Immediately, what flashed through my mind is, oh my God, I just arrested an 81 year [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2314.2s)]
*  old man with Alzheimer's who thinks he's Whitey Bulger. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2317.96s)]
*  What is he going to tell me next? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2320.84s)]
*  He's Elvis? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2321.84s)]
*  So I said, do me a favor. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2322.84s)]
*  I said, this woman over here says you have a touch of Alzheimer's. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2324.76s)]
*  He said, don't listen to her. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2327.2400000000002s)]
*  She's effing nuts. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2328.6400000000003s)]
*  He says, I'm James Bulger. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2329.88s)]
*  A few minutes later, he confirmed it, signing a consent form allowing the FBI to search [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2332.76s)]
*  his apartment. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2337.8s)]
*  As he's signing, he says, that's the first time I've signed that name in a long time. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2338.8s)]
*  There's a feeling of resignation. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2343.0s)]
*  I don't think he had it. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2345.36s)]
*  I did ask him, I said, hey, Whitey, aren't you relieved that you don't have to look over [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2346.7200000000003s)]
*  your shoulder anymore and it's come to an end? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2351.32s)]
*  And he said, are you effing nuts? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2354.68s)]
*  But in some ways, Whitey Bulger and Catherine Gregg had already been prisoners in apartment [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2356.8799999999997s)]
*  303, which appeared to be a mixture of the murderous and the mundane. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2362.0s)]
*  Alongside the weapons and all the money, they had stockpiled the lifetime supply of cleansers, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2368.3199999999997s)]
*  creams and detergents. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2373.72s)]
*  The FBI took special interest in a collection of 64 ounce bottles with white socks stretched [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2375.72s)]
*  over the top. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2381.7599999999998s)]
*  I said, hey, Whitey, what are these? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2382.84s)]
*  Are these some kind of molotov cocktail you're making? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2384.1600000000003s)]
*  He goes, no. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2386.32s)]
*  He said, I buy tube socks from the 99 cent store and the two Tytamite calves. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2387.32s)]
*  That's the way I stretch them out. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2391.6800000000003s)]
*  I said, why are you shopping at the 99 cent store? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2393.5200000000004s)]
*  You have half a million dollars under your bed. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2395.32s)]
*  He goes, I had to make the money last. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2397.44s)]
*  It's been said that one of the reasons it took so long to catch Whitey Bulger is that [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2400.76s)]
*  people were looking for a gangster and Bulger, whether he liked it or not, had ceased to [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2405.1200000000003s)]
*  be one. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2410.0s)]
*  He said it was hard to keep up that mindset of a criminal. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2411.08s)]
*  That's part of the reason he came down to that garage. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2414.68s)]
*  He said if he was on his game, you know, 15, 20, 30 years ago, he probably would have sent [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2418.64s)]
*  something there. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2423.6s)]
*  But he said it was hard to stay on that edge, the criminal edge, after being on the lam [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2425.04s)]
*  as a regular citizen for 15 years. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2430.92s)]
*  The master manipulator gave credit to Catherine Gregg for keeping him crime free, hoping it [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2433.88s)]
*  would mitigate her sentence. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2438.72s)]
*  She's now serving eight years for harboring a fugitive. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2440.6s)]
*  On the long plane ride back to Boston, Bulger told his captors that he became obsessed with [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2444.24s)]
*  not getting caught and would do anything to avoid it, even if it meant obeying the law. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2449.2799999999997s)]
*  Whitey Bulger's biggest fear, they said, was being discovered dead in his apartment, and [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2455.04s)]
*  he had a plan to avoid it. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2459.92s)]
*  If he became ill and knew he was on his deathbed, he'd go down to Arizona, crawl down the bottom [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2462.0s)]
*  of one of these mines and die and decompose and hope that we would never find him and [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2466.36s)]
*  still be looking for him forever. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2472.56s)]
*  Shortly after 9-11, the Pentagon ordered a top secret team of American commandos into [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2476.56s)]
*  Afghanistan with a single, simple order. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2500.12s)]
*  Kill Osama bin Laden. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2504.0s)]
*  It was America's best chance to eliminate the leader of al-Qaeda. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2505.94s)]
*  The inside story of exactly what happened in that mission and how close it came to its [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2510.32s)]
*  objective has never been told until tonight. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2515.06s)]
*  The man you're about to meet was the officer in command, leading a team from the U.S. Army's [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2518.92s)]
*  mysterious Delta Force, a unit so secret it's often said that Delta doesn't exist. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2524.18s)]
*  But you're about to see Delta's operators in action. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2531.52s)]
*  Why would the mission commander break his silence after seven years? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2535.38s)]
*  He told us that most everything he's read in the media about his mission is wrong, and [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2539.1400000000003s)]
*  tonight he wants to set the record straight. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2544.58s)]
*  Our job is to go find him, capture him, kill him, and we knew the writing on the wall was [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2548.5s)]
*  really to kill him. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2552.78s)]
*  No one wanted to bring Osama bin Laden back to stand trial in the United States somewhere. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2553.78s)]
*  In 2001, just ten weeks after 9-11, he was a 37-year-old Army major leading a team of [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2558.1s)]
*  America's most elite commandos. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2564.8199999999997s)]
*  Even now we can't tell you his name or show you his face. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2567.7799999999997s)]
*  We hired a theatrical makeup artist to take the former Delta officer through a series [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2572.22s)]
*  of transformations to create the man you see now. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2576.9799999999996s)]
*  He calls himself Dalton Fury. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2580.9599999999996s)]
*  He's the author of Kill Bin Laden, a new book out this week. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2583.14s)]
*  Dalton Fury is used to disguises. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2587.18s)]
*  In fact, in 2001, his entire team transformed itself in Afghanistan. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2589.38s)]
*  Everybody has their beard grown. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2596.82s)]
*  Everybody's wearing local Afghan clothing, sometimes carrying the same weapons as them. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2598.58s)]
*  The idea was that if this all worked out, Osama bin Laden would be dead and no one would [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2603.1s)]
*  ever know that Delta Force was there. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2609.38s)]
*  That's right. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2612.06s)]
*  That's the plan. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2613.06s)]
*  And that always is when you're talking about Delta Force. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2614.3s)]
*  And there was no mission more important to the United States. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2617.06s)]
*  We'll smoke him out of his cave and we'll get him eventually. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2620.94s)]
*  But the administration's strategy was to let Afghans do most of the fighting. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2625.2599999999998s)]
*  Using radio intercepts and other intelligence, the CIA pinpointed bin Laden in the mountains [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2630.2999999999997s)]
*  near the border of Pakistan. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2635.92s)]
*  Following the strategy of keeping an Afghan face on the war, Fury's Delta team joined [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2638.42s)]
*  the CIA and Afghan fighters and piled into pickup trucks. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2643.72s)]
*  They videotaped their journey to a place called Tora Bora. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2648.9199999999996s)]
*  Fury told us his orders were to kill bin Laden and leave the body with the Afghans. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2653.04s)]
*  Right here you're looking at basically the battlefield from the last location that we [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2659.24s)]
*  had firm on Osama bin Laden's location. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2663.2s)]
*  This ridge line is at about 14,000 feet and back this way toward me is Pakistan. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2665.7599999999998s)]
*  On a scale of say 1 to 10, 10 being the toughest, how tough a position is this to attack? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2671.12s)]
*  My experience is to 10. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2678.16s)]
*  Delta developed an audacious plan to come at bin Laden from the one direction he would [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2680.56s)]
*  never expect. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2685.52s)]
*  We want to come in on the back door. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2686.52s)]
*  You were going to come up over the tops of the peaks? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2689.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2691.16s)]
*  The original plan that we sent up to our higher headquarters, Delta Force wants to come in [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2692.16s)]
*  over the mountain with oxygen, coming from the Pakistan side, over the mountains and [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2696.62s)]
*  then come in and get a drop on bin Laden from behind. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2700.92s)]
*  Why didn't you do that? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2703.32s)]
*  Disapproved at some level above us. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2705.16s)]
*  Whether that was central command or all the way up to the President of the United States, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2707.44s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2711.04s)]
*  The next option Delta wanted to employ was to drop hundreds of landmines in the mountain [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2712.2000000000003s)]
*  passes that led to Pakistan, bin Laden's escape route. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2717.1800000000003s)]
*  First guy blows his leg off, everybody else stops. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2722.0s)]
*  That allows aircraft overhead to find them. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2724.6s)]
*  They see all these heat sources out there. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2726.84s)]
*  Okay, there's a big large group of al-Qaeda moving south. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2728.12s)]
*  They can engage that. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2730.76s)]
*  Why didn't you do that? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2731.9s)]
*  Disapproved. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2733.32s)]
*  Why was it not approved? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2734.32s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2736.48s)]
*  How often does Delta come up with a tactical plan that's disapproved by higher headquarters? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2738.6400000000003s)]
*  In my experience, in my five years at Delta, never before. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2744.1200000000003s)]
*  The military wouldn't tell us who rejected the plans or why. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2748.0400000000004s)]
*  Fury wasn't happy about it, but he pressed on with the only option he had left, a frontal [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2751.96s)]
*  assault on bin Laden's dug in al-Qaeda fighters. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2757.88s)]
*  The Delta team had only about 50 men, so the mission would depend on the Afghan militia [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2761.52s)]
*  as guides and muscle. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2767.28s)]
*  Their leader was a warlord, a self-styled general named Ali. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2769.6600000000003s)]
*  Ali told us after about 30 seconds of discussion, he kind of listened to me ramble on and then [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2774.7200000000003s)]
*  the first thing he said was, I don't think you guys can handle it. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2779.56s)]
*  You can't handle al-Qaeda in these mountains. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2782.84s)]
*  Ali, second from the left, met with this CIA officer and accepted millions of dollars [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2785.56s)]
*  in cash from the agency. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2791.48s)]
*  In short order, his Mujahideen fighters were escorting Delta force into the mountains. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2793.52s)]
*  Paint the picture for me of these Afghan Mujahideen troops. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2799.4s)]
*  They ranged anywhere from maybe 14 up to maybe 80. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2803.72s)]
*  Various dress, basically we would probably consider it rags, the standard dress for a [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2810.04s)]
*  Mujahideen warrior. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2814.64s)]
*  This is video of the top secret mission never seen by the public before. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2816.3199999999997s)]
*  It was recorded by the Delta commandos themselves. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2820.8199999999997s)]
*  Dressed like Afghans, the Americans maneuvered up the mountains calling in airstrikes on [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2824.52s)]
*  al-Qaeda. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2829.4s)]
*  By day, they would advance, but at night, they soon discovered that their Afghan allies [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2830.4s)]
*  went home. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2837.16s)]
*  Well, I have to assume that if you started up the hills of Tora Bora and the Mujahideen [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2838.72s)]
*  took territory, they didn't abandon that at night. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2845.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, yes they did. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2848.52s)]
*  They gave it up to the enemy? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2849.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2851.16s)]
*  The Mujahideen would go up and get into a skirmish, a firefight, lose a guy or two, maybe kill [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2852.16s)]
*  an al-Qaeda guy or two, and then they'd leave. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2856.3999999999996s)]
*  It was almost like it was an agreement, an understanding between the two forces fighting [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2858.6s)]
*  each other. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2861.92s)]
*  Almost put on a good show and then leave. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2862.92s)]
*  Four days after arriving in Tora Bora, Dalton Fury was faced with a fateful command decision. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2865.76s)]
*  Three of his men were in trouble behind enemy lines and at the same time, the CIA had been [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2872.7200000000003s)]
*  listening to Bin Laden's radio transmissions and had a breakthrough. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2878.42s)]
*  And this is where it gets complicated. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2883.48s)]
*  At about the same time, the CIA, George, comes into our room and he says, guys, I've got [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2884.7200000000003s)]
*  a location for Osama Bin Laden. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2891.1200000000003s)]
*  It's probably the best locational data we've had on Osama Bin Laden ever. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2892.96s)]
*  It was night, so Fury was without his Afghan allies. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2897.0s)]
*  Still, he managed to rescue his men and then found himself approaching Bin Laden's doorstep. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2900.4s)]
*  We're about 2,000 meters away from where we think Bin Laden's at still, from where we're [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2907.8s)]
*  at. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2912.96s)]
*  Now we have to make a decision. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2913.96s)]
*  Fury had two choices, advance his small team with no Afghan support or return to camp and [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2915.28s)]
*  assault in the morning. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2921.32s)]
*  He was under orders to make the Afghans take the lead and intelligence said there were [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2923.1200000000003s)]
*  more than 1,000 hardened fighters protecting Bin Laden. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2928.56s)]
*  You write in the book, my decision to abort that effort to kill or capture Bin Laden when [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2932.7400000000002s)]
*  we might have been within 2,000 meters of him, about 2,000 yards, still bothers me. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2937.6200000000003s)]
*  It leaves me with a feeling of somehow letting down our nation at a critical time. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2945.04s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2951.2s)]
*  Why do you feel that way? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2952.2s)]
*  Had we gone up that ridge line towards that location, Osama Bin Laden might have been [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2957.8799999999997s)]
*  500 meters away. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2963.2s)]
*  We might have run right into him. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2964.2s)]
*  So there's always that doubt that we might have run into him. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2966.04s)]
*  We also might have got up there and found nothing. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2969.7599999999998s)]
*  It wasn't worth the risk at that particular moment to go up there and play cowboy. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2972.3999999999996s)]
*  It was better to be cautious, refit, go up there with the entire force the next day [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2977.44s)]
*  and play the battle out as we had planned. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2982.92s)]
*  In the morning, Bin Laden was on the radio. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2985.36s)]
*  The CIA, Delta and their Afghan allies were listening. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2987.76s)]
*  How did the Afghans react when they heard from Osama Bin Laden on the radio? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2992.16s)]
*  Osama Bin Laden is many a Muslim's hero. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=2998.32s)]
*  These guys, in my opinion, were more in awe of Osama Bin Laden than they were willing [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3003.4s)]
*  to kill him. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3009.0s)]
*  When they heard him talking on the radio, they would gather around the individual that [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3010.0s)]
*  held that handheld transistor. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3013.7200000000003s)]
*  He would hold it up in the air, almost as if he didn't want the connection to break. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3015.64s)]
*  Almost like they could see the ridge line Osama Bin Laden happened to be talking from, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3019.76s)]
*  like they could almost see him and feel his presence. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3022.96s)]
*  They just stood there with wide eyes and somewhat in awe that here is a leader of the jihad, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3025.92s)]
*  the leader of Al-Qaeda, and they're actually hearing his voice over the radio. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3031.68s)]
*  And these were the men who were supposed to help you capture or kill him? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3035.12s)]
*  Some allies. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3040.12s)]
*  Some were better than others. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3042.3599999999997s)]
*  The radio intercepts gave Delta a fix on Bin Laden's location, and one of the Delta's soldiers [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3045.16s)]
*  narrated his own video. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3050.96s)]
*  This top hill, very top up there, that's supposedly where Bin Laden's hanging out. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3053.54s)]
*  We've seen movement along this saddle right here. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3061.36s)]
*  We don't know if it's that friendly or not, so we haven't been able to call fire on it. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3070.28s)]
*  And then something extraordinary happened. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3074.36s)]
*  Fury's Afghan allies announced that they had negotiated a ceasefire with Al-Qaeda, something [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3077.28s)]
*  the Americans had no interest in. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3083.84s)]
*  When Fury's team advanced anyway, his Afghan partners drew their weapons on Delta. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3086.3199999999997s)]
*  It took 12 hours to end the bogus ceasefire, precious time for Al-Qaeda to move. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3092.6s)]
*  So we think he's moved over here. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3098.8399999999997s)]
*  So Osama Bin Laden starts here, as far as we know, and he's coming all the way around. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3101.14s)]
*  Now he's doubled back. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3105.56s)]
*  You've got to figure he's heading for the valley and to pass into Pakistan. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3107.24s)]
*  Our assumption is he's going for the valley at that time. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3111.88s)]
*  Bin Laden had changed direction and the tone of his radio calls. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3114.56s)]
*  Clearly unaddressed, clearly hurting, clearly caring for his men. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3119.68s)]
*  Inside this building, the American team listened to Bin Laden on the radio. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3125.2s)]
*  Fury wrote down the translation in a notebook. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3129.52s)]
*  Quote, our prayers were not answered. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3132.48s)]
*  Times are dire and bad. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3136.56s)]
*  We did not get support from the apostates who are our brothers. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3139.38s)]
*  I'm sorry for bringing you here. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3143.36s)]
*  It is okay to surrender. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3145.1200000000003s)]
*  End quote. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3146.32s)]
*  When you heard that, what did you think? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3147.6800000000003s)]
*  I thought it's almost over. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3151.76s)]
*  Soon after that intercept, a Delta team called Jackal radioed that they had Bin Laden's [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3153.84s)]
*  entourage in sight. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3159.2000000000003s)]
*  The Operation Jackal team observed 50 men moving into a cave that they hadn't seen before. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3161.4s)]
*  The Mujerdeen said they saw an individual, a taller fellow, wearing a camouflage jacket. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3169.6s)]
*  Everybody put two and two together, okay, that's got to be you, saw Bin Laden egressing [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3174.6s)]
*  from the battlefield. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3177.8s)]
*  They called up every available bomb in the air, took control of the airspace, and they [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3178.8s)]
*  dropped several hours of bombs on the cave he went into. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3182.32s)]
*  We believe, it was our opinion at the time, that he died inside that cave. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3185.92s)]
*  Bin Laden's radio went silent and Dalton Fury believed that the bombs had killed him. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3189.92s)]
*  Six months later, American and Canadian forces came back for proof. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3196.32s)]
*  They checked Al-Qaeda fighting holes and used explosives to try to open up collapsed caves. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3201.2400000000002s)]
*  This is where they hope to find Bin Laden's body. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3209.3s)]
*  It's an Al-Qaeda graveyard rising from the opium poppies. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3212.0s)]
*  The troops dug up bodies and removed the fingers for forensic analysis, but there was no luck. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3215.7400000000002s)]
*  In October 2004, Bin Laden released a message and Fury knew that his team had failed. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3222.38s)]
*  Today, based on intelligence, Fury believes he knows what happened. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3229.34s)]
*  He says that Bin Laden was wounded in the shoulder by shrapnel from an American bomb [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3233.82s)]
*  and was then hidden in this town next to the Al-Qaeda cemetery. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3238.82s)]
*  We believe a gentleman brought him in, a gentleman who, him and his family were supporting Al-Qaeda [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3243.88s)]
*  during the battle. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3249.2200000000003s)]
*  We're providing food, ammo, water. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3250.22s)]
*  We think he went to that house, received medical attention for a few days, and then we believe [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3252.5s)]
*  they put him in a vehicle and moved him back across the pass. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3256.7s)]
*  This is the trail Bin Laden would have used to escape. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3259.56s)]
*  It's my understanding they believe he got into a vehicle, he moved as far as he could, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3263.3399999999997s)]
*  and he got out and walked across or was carried across the pass in Pakistan, free and clear. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3267.5s)]
*  When this is all over and this all dies down, and once we finally do grab Osama Bin Laden, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3272.6s)]
*  I think the fact that we lost him in Toribora will move out of my memory, so to speak. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3277.56s)]
*  I'm looking forward to those days. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iRHadMzAvs&t=3283.56s)]
