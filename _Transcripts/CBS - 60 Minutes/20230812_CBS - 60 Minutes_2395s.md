# Dogs | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [August 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU)
*  Sounds of a clock ticking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=0.0s)]
*  Human beings have lived with dogs for thousands of years. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=12.0s)]
*  You'd think that after all that time we'd have discovered all there is to know about them. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=15.0s)]
*  But it turns out that until recently scientists didn't pay much attention to dogs. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=20.0s)]
*  Dolphins have been studied for decades, apes and chimps as well. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=24.0s)]
*  but dogs, with whom we share our lives, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=28.0s)]
*  were never thought to be worthy of serious study. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=30.0s)]
*  As a result, we know very little about what actually goes on inside dogs' brains. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=33.0s)]
*  Do they really love us, or are dogs just licking us so they can get fed? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=38.0s)]
*  How much of our language can they understand? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=42.0s)]
*  Before you answer, we want you to meet Chaser, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=45.0s)]
*  who's been called the smartest dog in the world. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=48.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to Wofford. Hoop! [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=52.0s)]
*  Good girl, good girl, good girl. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=54.0s)]
*  86-year-old retired psychology professor John Pilly and his border colleague Chaser are inseparable. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=56.0s)]
*  We're almost there. We're almost there. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=63.0s)]
*  Can you speak? Speak. Speak. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=66.0s)]
*  Bark! [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=68.0s)]
*  Good girl, good girl. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=69.0s)]
*  Do you view Chaser as a family pet, as a friend? How do you see Chaser? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=70.0s)]
*  She's our child. She's our child, a member of the family, yes. She comes first. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=76.0s)]
*  Many people think of their dogs as children, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=82.0s)]
*  but John Pilly has been teaching her like a child as well. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=85.0s)]
*  By signing names to toys, Pilly has been helping Chaser learn words and simple sentences. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=89.0s)]
*  Take KG. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=96.0s)]
*  He's been teaching her up to five hours a day. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=98.0s)]
*  Five days a week for the past nine years. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=101.0s)]
*  My best metaphor is this is a two-year-old toddler. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=105.0s)]
*  That's how you think about your dog, a two-year-old toddler? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=108.0s)]
*  Yeah. She has the capabilities of a two-year-old. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=110.0s)]
*  Chicken, chicken, chicken. Where's chicken? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=114.0s)]
*  He's not kidding. Yes, good girl. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=116.0s)]
*  Most two-year-old toddlers... [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=118.0s)]
*  And tub. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=119.0s)]
*  ...know about 300 words. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=120.0s)]
*  Figure eight, figure eight. Good girl, that's figure eight. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=122.0s)]
*  Chaser's vocabulary... [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=125.0s)]
*  Good girl, good girl. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=126.0s)]
*  ...is three times that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=127.0s)]
*  To tub. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=128.0s)]
*  She's learned the names of more than a thousand toys. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=129.0s)]
*  And all of those toys add up. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=132.0s)]
*  Wheel. Wheel. Yes. Bring it out. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=134.0s)]
*  To show us Chaser's collection, Pilly brought us to his back porch. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=136.0s)]
*  So these are all the toys in here? Yes. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=140.0s)]
*  Got a chicken in here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=142.0s)]
*  Is it all right if I dump them out? Please do. Please do. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=144.0s)]
*  There are 800 cloth animals, 116 different balls, and more than 100 plastic toys. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=148.0s)]
*  1,022 toys in all, each with a unique name. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=155.0s)]
*  So Chaser could recognize the names of every one of these toys? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=160.0s)]
*  That's true. That's true. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=163.0s)]
*  To prove it, Pilly cataloged the toys and then, over the course of three years, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=164.0s)]
*  gave Chaser hundreds of tests like this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=169.0s)]
*  Chaser, find a circle. Find a circle. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=172.0s)]
*  In every test, Chaser correctly identified 95% or more of the toys. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=174.0s)]
*  Find a circle, Chaser. Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=179.0s)]
*  The results were published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, and a star was born. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=181.0s)]
*  How are you? Good to see you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=186.0s)]
*  Tom, so glad to see you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=188.0s)]
*  Chaser even landed a book deal. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=190.0s)]
*  You too. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=192.0s)]
*  But John Pilly didn't stop with the names of toys. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=193.0s)]
*  Nose KG. Nose KG. Nose it. Nose it. Good girl. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=196.0s)]
*  He's taught Chaser that nouns and verbs have different meanings. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=201.0s)]
*  Paw it. Paw it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=204.0s)]
*  And can be combined in a variety of ways. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=205.0s)]
*  Take wheel. Do it. Go. Do it. Okay. Out. Out. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=208.0s)]
*  Chase. Take KG. Do it. Good. Good girl. Good girl. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=212.0s)]
*  So she's actually understanding the difference between take, paw, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=216.0s)]
*  putting her paw on something and putting her nose on something. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=219.0s)]
*  Right. And that's what we're demonstrating. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=221.0s)]
*  All this learning has been possible, Pilly says, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=223.0s)]
*  because of a breakthrough Chaser had when she was just a puppy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=226.0s)]
*  At a certain point she realized that objects have names. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=230.0s)]
*  Right. It was an insight. It came to her. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=232.0s)]
*  How could you tell that she'd suddenly had that insight? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=235.0s)]
*  Well, it was in the fifth month and she'd learned about 40 names. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=237.0s)]
*  And the time necessary to work with her kept getting shorter and shorter. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=241.0s)]
*  She was starting to learn words faster and faster? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=245.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=247.0s)]
*  It's the closest thing in animals we've seen to being like what young children do [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=248.0s)]
*  as they're learning words. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=253.0s)]
*  Brian Hare, an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=254.0s)]
*  believes Chaser is the most important dog in the history of modern scientific research. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=258.0s)]
*  This is very serious science. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=263.0s)]
*  We're not talking about stupid pet tricks where people have spent hours [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=265.0s)]
*  trying to just train a dog to do the same thing over and over. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=269.0s)]
*  What's neat about what Chaser's doing is Chaser is learning tons, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=273.0s)]
*  literally thousands of new things by using the same ability that kids use [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=278.0s)]
*  when they learn lots of words. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=283.0s)]
*  He's talking about what researchers call social inference, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=285.0s)]
*  a capability humans like Hare's son Luke acquire around age one. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=288.0s)]
*  To demonstrate the concept, Hare hides a ball under one of these two cups. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=293.0s)]
*  Hey, lookie guy. Where is it? Can you get it? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=298.0s)]
*  Can you get the ball? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=301.0s)]
*  Luke doesn't know which cup the ball is under, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=304.0s)]
*  but when his father points, he makes an inference. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=307.0s)]
*  Hey, nice job. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=311.0s)]
*  You got it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=314.0s)]
*  So what does that show you? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=315.0s)]
*  So when kids his age start understanding pointing, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=316.0s)]
*  it's right when the foundations of what lead to language and culture start to develop. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=320.0s)]
*  Hey. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=325.0s)]
*  It might look simple, but when Hare tried the same test with bonobos, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=326.0s)]
*  great apes he studied for more than a decade, look what happened. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=329.0s)]
*  Bonobos, our closest genetic relatives, can't do it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=333.0s)]
*  You chose the wrong one. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=337.0s)]
*  But Hare discovered dogs can. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=339.0s)]
*  You ready? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=342.0s)]
*  I'm going to hide in one of these two places. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=343.0s)]
*  This two-year-old Labrador named Sisu has no trouble understanding the meaning of pointing. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=345.0s)]
*  Now she doesn't know for sure which place you put it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=349.0s)]
*  That's right. There's no way she could know, and I'm just going to tell her where it is. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=351.0s)]
*  Okay, Sisu. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=354.0s)]
*  So that's really hard for a lot of animals, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=357.0s)]
*  and that's what's really special about dogs is they're really similar to even human toddlers. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=359.0s)]
*  That's a level of thinking that people didn't really think dogs could do. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=364.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, there was no evidence until the last decade that dogs were capable of inferential reasoning. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=368.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. So that's what's new. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=374.0s)]
*  That's what's shocking is that of all the species, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=376.0s)]
*  it's dogs that are showing a couple of abilities that are really important [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=378.0s)]
*  that allow humans to develop culture and language. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=382.0s)]
*  It's not surprising that dogs share characteristics with humans. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=385.0s)]
*  After all, we've evolved alongside each other for more than 15,000 years. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=389.0s)]
*  There are now some 80 million dogs in this country, more dogs than children. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=393.0s)]
*  But for all the playing and petting, the companionship, we still know very little about their brains. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=398.0s)]
*  Dr. Greg Burns, a physician and neuroscientist at Emory University, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=404.0s)]
*  has studied the human brain for more than two decades. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=409.0s)]
*  But three years ago, questions he had about his own dog [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=412.0s)]
*  inspired him to start looking at the canine brain. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=415.0s)]
*  It started out with the desire to know, really, what does my dog think of me? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=419.0s)]
*  I love my dog, but do they reciprocate in any way? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=423.0s)]
*  When they hear you come home, you know, they start jumping around. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=426.0s)]
*  Is it just because they expect you to feed them? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=429.0s)]
*  Is this just a scam by the dogs? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=432.0s)]
*  Are dogs just big scammers? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=434.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=436.0s)]
*  To try and answer that question, Dr. Burns is doing something [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=437.0s)]
*  scientists have had a difficult time with. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=440.0s)]
*  He's conducting brain scans on dogs while they're awake and unsedated. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=443.0s)]
*  Inside the fMRI machine, they're trained to stay completely still. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=448.0s)]
*  How hard is it to get a dog to do this? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=453.0s)]
*  This represents probably about three to four months of training, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=455.0s)]
*  and so most of the dogs take that long. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=459.0s)]
*  What's around Tigger's head here? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=461.0s)]
*  The scanner makes a lot of noise, quite loud, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=462.0s)]
*  and because dog's hearing is more sensitive than ours, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=464.0s)]
*  we have to protect their hearing just like ours. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=467.0s)]
*  So we put earplugs and earmuffs and just wrap it all to just keep it in place. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=470.0s)]
*  Okay, now we can go up. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=476.0s)]
*  Tigger certainly knows the drill. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=478.0s)]
*  That's good. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=480.0s)]
*  Once in the machine, he lies down and doesn't move. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=481.0s)]
*  These scans are giving Dr. Burns the first glimpse at how a dog's brain actually works. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=485.0s)]
*  So these are slices of Tigger's brain that you're seeing? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=491.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=494.0s)]
*  We're slicing from top to bottom. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=495.0s)]
*  We analyze them later to see which parts increase in response to the different signals. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=497.0s)]
*  While in the scanner, the dogs smell cotton swabs with different scents. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=502.0s)]
*  First, the underarm sweat of a complete stranger. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=506.0s)]
*  Next, the sweat of their owner. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=509.0s)]
*  As Dr. Burns expected, when the dogs sniffed the swabs, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=511.0s)]
*  the part of their brain associated with smell, an area right behind the nose, activated. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=514.0s)]
*  It didn't matter what the scent was. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=519.0s)]
*  But it was when the dogs got a whiff of their owner's sweat [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=521.0s)]
*  that another area of the brain was stimulated, the caudate nucleus, or reward center. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=524.0s)]
*  Dr. Burns believes that means the dog is experiencing more than the good feeling that comes with a meal. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=529.0s)]
*  It shows the dog is recognizing somebody extremely important to them. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=535.0s)]
*  It's the same area in a human brain that activates when we listen to a favorite song [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=539.0s)]
*  or anticipate being with someone we love. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=543.0s)]
*  So just by smelling the sweat of their owner, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=546.0s)]
*  it triggers something in a much stronger way than it does with a stranger? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=549.0s)]
*  Right, which means that it's a positive feeling, a positive association. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=553.0s)]
*  And that's something you can prove through MRIs. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=557.0s)]
*  It's not just, I mean, previously people would say, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=560.0s)]
*  well, yeah, obviously my dog loves me. I see its tail wagging and it seems really happy when it sees me. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=562.0s)]
*  Right. Now we're using the brain as kind of the test to say, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=566.0s)]
*  okay, when we see activity in these reward centers, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=570.0s)]
*  that means the dog is experiencing something that it likes or it wants and it's a good feeling. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=573.0s)]
*  My takeaway from this is that I'm not being scammed by my dog. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=578.0s)]
*  Did you have that feeling beforehand? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=582.0s)]
*  Yeah, I totally, yeah, I worry about that all the time. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=584.0s)]
*  Watch YouTube videos of dogs welcoming home returning service members, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=586.0s)]
*  and it's easy to see the bond between dogs and their owners. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=591.0s)]
*  I miss you too. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=594.0s)]
*  Brian Hare says there's even more proof of that bond. It's found in our bloodstreams. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=596.0s)]
*  We know that when dogs and humans make eye contact, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=601.0s)]
*  that that actually releases what's known as the love hormone, oxytocin, in both the dog and the human. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=604.0s)]
*  It turns out oxytocin, the same hormone that helps new mothers bond with their babies, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=609.0s)]
*  is released in both dogs and humans when they play, touch, or look into one another's eyes. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=614.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=620.0s)]
*  What we know now is that when dogs are actually looking at you, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=622.0s)]
*  they're essentially hugging you with their eyes. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=625.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=628.0s)]
*  Yes. And so it's not just that when a dog is making a lot of eye contact with you, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=629.0s)]
*  that they're just trying to get something from you. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=633.0s)]
*  It actually probably is just really enjoyable for them, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=635.0s)]
*  because they get an oxytocin or they get an uptick in this love hormone too. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=638.0s)]
*  All these new discoveries about dogs have led Brian Hare to create a science-based website called Dognition, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=643.0s)]
*  where owners can learn to play games to test their dog's brain power. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=649.0s)]
*  So you're allowing people to do an intelligence test for their dog? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=654.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. And the idea, though, is that there's not one type of intelligence. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=656.0s)]
*  We help you measure things like how your dog communicates, how empathic your dog is, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=660.0s)]
*  is your dog cunning, is your dog actually capable of abstract thought, like reasoning? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=664.0s)]
*  So there are different kinds of intelligence for dogs just like with humans? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=669.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And so just like some humans are good at English and others are good at math, it's the same for dogs. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=671.0s)]
*  When Hare tested his own dog, a mixed breed named Tassie, he was surprised by what he learned. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=677.0s)]
*  What I found out was that I had somebody sleeping in my bed that I didn't even know. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=683.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=687.0s)]
*  And I didn't know my dog doesn't really rely on its working memory. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=688.0s)]
*  So if I'm saying sit and stay, I no longer have to wonder why my dog wanders off. He like literally forgot. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=691.0s)]
*  So your dog's not the sharpest of dogs? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=698.0s)]
*  He did great on communication. He's very communicative. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=700.0s)]
*  So he could basically be a TV anchor, is what you're saying. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=704.0s)]
*  Petch shirt. Petch shirt. There we go. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=707.0s)]
*  If you're wondering how Chaser did on Brian Hare's intelligence tests, she was off the charts on reasoning and memory. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=712.0s)]
*  Not surprising perhaps considering Chaser is a border collie. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=719.0s)]
*  Dogs bred specifically for their ability to understand how farmers want their sheep herded. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=723.0s)]
*  Is Chaser just like an Einstein of dogs? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=729.0s)]
*  So that's really fun. Is Chaser somehow special? And I think the idea actually is that no. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=731.0s)]
*  I mean when Dr. Pilli chose Chaser, he just randomly took her out of a litter. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=736.0s)]
*  What's special is that he spends so much time playing these games to help her learn words. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=740.0s)]
*  But are there lots of Chasers out there? Absolutely. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=746.0s)]
*  On your mark, get set, go. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=749.0s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of people who see this and are jealous of your relationship with Chaser. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=753.0s)]
*  I mean I now think about my own dog and kind of think, wow, I've missed the boat. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=757.0s)]
*  I haven't sort of helped my dog live up to her potential. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=762.0s)]
*  Well, start working with your dog more. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=765.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're so sweet. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=771.0s)]
*  There's a good chance that many of you watching right now have a dog somewhere nearby. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=780.0s)]
*  But what do you actually know about where dogs come from? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=784.0s)]
*  You're probably aware they evolved from wolves, but how and when? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=787.0s)]
*  It turns out much of that is still a mystery. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=792.0s)]
*  There are some intriguing clues, however, that have been discovered in the DNA of dogs and wolves. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=794.0s)]
*  Clues that just might give us a better understanding of how they and we evolved. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=799.0s)]
*  You've heard of survival of the fittest, but a scientist at Duke University says the term that may best describe dogs' evolutionary success is survival of the friendliest. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=804.0s)]
*  There's no doubt dogs are an evolutionary triumph. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=816.0s)]
*  There's an estimated billion of them on the planet, and they've nosed their way into every corner of our lives. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=819.0s)]
*  Living with us, working with us, and loving us. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=825.0s)]
*  What is it you're trying to understand about dogs? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=830.0s)]
*  I'm really interested in where dogs come from, and I think it teaches us a lot about where humans came from. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=833.0s)]
*  Ryan Hare, an evolutionary biologist and author at Duke University, has spent the last 25 years studying animal evolution. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=840.0s)]
*  How do you look? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=848.0s)]
*  I think what really summarizes the link between dog and human evolution is survival of the friendliest. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=849.0s)]
*  What about survival of the fittest? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=855.0s)]
*  So survival of the fittest is a misconstrual, really, in the public mind of what evolution is. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=857.0s)]
*  It's like the idea that the biggest, the strongest are always the one that win. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=862.0s)]
*  Might makes right. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=866.0s)]
*  Yeah, but not at all, and dogs are exhibit A of this. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=867.0s)]
*  Hare says it may be hard to imagine, but that sweet dog you love started out as this. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=871.0s)]
*  A wild, predatory wolf, and their evolutionary story began at least 20,000 years ago when humans were hunter-gatherers. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=879.0s)]
*  So what we believe happened, and we have science to show some of this, is that wolves chose us. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=887.0s)]
*  A population of wolves actually became attracted to humans, and they were at an advantage because they were eating garbage, things that people were leaving around home, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=894.0s)]
*  and that the wolves that sort of basically gave up on being wolfy and hunting and were attracted and friendliest towards humans, they were at a huge advantage. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=903.0s)]
*  Some wolves were able to feed off scraps, they weren't aggressive, and over time they became domesticated. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=911.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=918.0s)]
*  Come on in. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=920.0s)]
*  To better understand how the two species diverged so drastically, Brian Hare came here to the Wildlife Science Center in Minnesota. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=921.0s)]
*  You want to go and I'll drag? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=929.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=931.0s)]
*  This was done by director Peggy Callahan and her 23-year-old daughter Meg. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=932.0s)]
*  Both skilled, we saw it navigating a cage full of hungry wolves. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=936.0s)]
*  Back up, MJ. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=940.0s)]
*  Back up. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=941.0s)]
*  Back up. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=942.0s)]
*  Nope, nope. I know you're hungry. I don't get pissed at me. This is only going as far as it's going. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=943.0s)]
*  Yeah, you might want to just hand it over. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=947.0s)]
*  There are 110 gray wolves here. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=950.0s)]
*  Hi. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=953.0s)]
*  Some were rescued from the wild, but most were hand raised by Peggy and Meg. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=954.0s)]
*  They're divided into packs separated by chain-link fences. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=959.0s)]
*  This pack is named after the 80s horror movie Children of the Corn. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=962.0s)]
*  So I saw the movie Children of the Corn, which is terrifying. Why is this pack called Children of the Corn? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=968.0s)]
*  For terrifying reasons. They attacked and killed their father and then tried to kill their mother. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=973.0s)]
*  This pack? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=980.0s)]
*  This pack. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=981.0s)]
*  Why did they kill their father? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=982.0s)]
*  Opportunity. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=983.0s)]
*  Opportunity? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=984.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=985.0s)]
*  Come here. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=986.0s)]
*  Come here to see me. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=987.0s)]
*  Peggy told us the only reason we were able to sit among the Children of the Corn is because these wolves view her as the dominant member of their pack. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=989.0s)]
*  Why is it important that in their mind you are dominant to them? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=997.0s)]
*  The reverse is quite dangerous. I know that they're capable of killing one another. Their teeth are, their jaw pressure is enormous. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1002.0s)]
*  By the way, even right now with the wolves coming up behind you, you're aware they're behind you. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1009.0s)]
*  Yes. We have to have eyes on the back of your head. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1013.0s)]
*  They're assessing who are we, who's dominant. Could I take this person? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1015.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. And what I, I don't, I don't think they're planning anything, but I think should an opportunity afford, they're incredible opportunists. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1020.0s)]
*  Peggy works hard to secure the upper hand. If you have any doubt about her position as the alpha dog, just listen. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1031.0s)]
*  Can you show me your how? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1038.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1040.0s)]
*  Howl. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1045.0s)]
*  Ghost bumps every time. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1059.0s)]
*  That was so cool. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1063.0s)]
*  So wouldn't you learn to howl if that happened? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1065.0s)]
*  What is the significance of the howl? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1068.0s)]
*  They use it to mark territory. They also will howl at intruders to get them to leave. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1070.0s)]
*  Becoming dominant over a wolf starts early. If a pup needs to be taken away from its mother for health or research purposes, Meg steps in. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1077.0s)]
*  Told you I'd bring a wolf puppy to visit. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1085.0s)]
*  When we were there with her in May, she was taking one month old Filo everywhere, even the morning coffee run. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1088.0s)]
*  Sometimes if he gets really mouthy, ouch, like that. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1094.0s)]
*  Good boy. So it's just a little correction. I just pinch and I growl. And then the second he stops growling, I'm like, oh, yeah, I whine to him and rub his belly and stuff. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1097.0s)]
*  That's what his mother would do? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1109.0s)]
*  Exactly. Yep. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1110.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. There's some wolf that looked just like you that was back talking to me there. Not you. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1113.0s)]
*  But don't be fooled. Dominance has its limits. This is MJ. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1118.0s)]
*  This is the dominant female. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1123.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1124.0s)]
*  She was also hand raised and likes a belly rub too. That is, until she doesn't. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1125.0s)]
*  She's tolerating this. I mean, she's, oh, oh, no, she's not. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1130.0s)]
*  Okay, enough. Okay. She just said stop. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1137.0s)]
*  I heard. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1140.0s)]
*  To see just how far dogs have evolved because of domestication, at Duke University, Brian Hare has set up a puppy kindergarten. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1143.0s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1151.0s)]
*  Students help raise Labrador puppies. They tag along. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1153.0s)]
*  Cruising the quad, going to basketball practice, even the track team's photo shoot. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1158.0s)]
*  Part of the program is aimed at training service dogs for the organization Canine Companions. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1170.0s)]
*  But there's research being done too. To compare the puppies to hand raise wolf pups, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1174.0s)]
*  Brian Hare's team runs them through a series of behavioral tests. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1179.0s)]
*  Look, look. Okay. Yes. Good job. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1183.0s)]
*  Watch again. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1189.0s)]
*  Puppy, look. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1190.0s)]
*  Notice how this puppy looks back and forth from the researcher to the bowl and then immediately follows her point. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1191.0s)]
*  Puppy, look. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1197.0s)]
*  Philo, the wolf puppy, might look like a dog, but watch him taking the same test. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1198.0s)]
*  Puppy, look. Okay. Okay, baby. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1202.0s)]
*  What is it? What is it? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1210.0s)]
*  So you can see Philo didn't follow the point here. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1215.0s)]
*  But a puppy at this age would. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1217.0s)]
*  Totally. Exactly. So it looks like dog puppies come into the world kind of prepared to understand us in a way that wolf puppies are not because of domestication and interacting with us. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1219.0s)]
*  You've done testing with dozens of wolves. Overall, what have you found? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1228.0s)]
*  So you can spend 24 hours a day with, say, a wolf puppy. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1233.0s)]
*  And even after you've done that for several months, they're not attracted to new people. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1238.0s)]
*  They don't want to be with people. They want to be with wolves. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1244.0s)]
*  That's not what happens in the case of dogs. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1247.0s)]
*  As a species, they're actually what's known as xenophilic. They're attracted to new things and new people. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1249.0s)]
*  But how much of that is in their genes? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1255.0s)]
*  Back in 2010, to figure that out, here's colleague Brigitte von Holt, a geneticist at Princeton, started comparing the DNA of dogs to wolves. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1257.0s)]
*  You've located some specific genes that lead to friendly behavior. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1266.0s)]
*  That's right. And when we sequenced a bunch of dogs and a bunch of wolves, we used that to then search for mutations in the dog genome that only dogs had. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1272.0s)]
*  And we came out with a really nice hot spot of mutations on chromosome number six in the dog genome. And that's what's highlighted here. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1282.0s)]
*  You can actually pinpoint genetic mutations in dogs that make that dog friendly to humans in a way that wolves are not. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1291.0s)]
*  Absolutely. This was a major finding, in my opinion. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1300.0s)]
*  And that is something that would have evolved over time. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1305.0s)]
*  That's right. So we can imagine back in the pre-dog era where there were wolves running around and some of those wolves were maybe making their dens closer to human settlements. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1309.0s)]
*  I hypothesize that if I could go and sequence those wolves, that they would carry maybe two of these mutations and the rest of the wolves, maybe none. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1321.0s)]
*  Brigitte von Holt calls these friendliness mutations. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1331.0s)]
*  So does my dog really love me or is my dog just acting out on its genetic code? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1335.0s)]
*  She absolutely loves you. She has the genetic predisposition to wholeheartedly love you more than she probably can handle. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1340.0s)]
*  What came next in von Holt's research stunned her and us. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1349.0s)]
*  She found the location of the friendliness mutations in dogs corresponds to the same genes that when deleted in humans cause a rare condition called Williams syndrome. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1353.0s)]
*  Her study established one of the first genetic links in behavior between dogs and humans. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1364.0s)]
*  Meet 36-year-old Ben Monqueba. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1370.0s)]
*  How are you, sir? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1372.0s)]
*  I'm well. How are you, sir? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1373.0s)]
*  What a surprise. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1374.0s)]
*  Ben is no stranger to 60 Minutes. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1375.0s)]
*  When he was 11 in 1997, Morley Safer met him doing a story on Williams syndrome. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1378.0s)]
*  I'm Morley. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1383.0s)]
*  Morley Safer? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1384.0s)]
*  Yes, himself. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1385.0s)]
*  How are you? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1386.0s)]
*  People with Williams syndrome like Ben are often unusually outgoing and friendly, leading some to call it cocktail party personality. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1389.0s)]
*  What is it that makes you unique? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1397.0s)]
*  What makes me unique is my way of giving happiness to people, my friendliness, my kindness. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1399.0s)]
*  I gotta say, just meeting you, you made me smile the moment we met. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1406.0s)]
*  When people are happy, it makes me feel like I've achieved something. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1410.0s)]
*  Williams syndrome is a lifelong condition that often causes serious medical problems and intellectual disabilities. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1413.0s)]
*  Ben's mom, Terri Monqueba, says Ben and others like him are so trusting and friendly they can sometimes be taken advantage of. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1420.0s)]
*  Just explain what is different about Ben genetically. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1428.0s)]
*  Sure, Ben is missing 25 genes on chromosome 7. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1432.0s)]
*  All of those genes line up, so that's one tenth of one percent of their genetic makeup that is missing. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1436.0s)]
*  That deletion in Ben's DNA and others with Williams syndrome involves the same genes that contain the friendliness mutations discovered in dogs. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1442.0s)]
*  Ben, what do you think about that? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1450.0s)]
*  That there might be a link, friendliness in dogs, there might be a link to friendliness in humans. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1452.0s)]
*  It just makes me feel so happy and proud that dogs and people have similarities. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1459.0s)]
*  When the discovery was announced in 2017, Terri was head of the Williams Syndrome Association. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1466.0s)]
*  She reached out to some members to see how they felt about it. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1472.0s)]
*  And one of the parents that I called said, are you kidding? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1476.0s)]
*  You know, I'm sure that if a tail was put on my son, it would be wagging all the time. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1479.0s)]
*  And I think that really put it into perspective. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1486.0s)]
*  Understanding why dogs are so friendly, Brian Hare tells us, is helping unravel the mystery of how Homo sapiens came to be the most dominant species on earth. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1490.0s)]
*  So what is our understanding of dog evolution? Tell us about human evolution. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1500.0s)]
*  I think what dog evolution teaches us is that actually how you get ahead in the game of life is you evolve a new way to be friendly that leads to a new form of cooperation. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1504.0s)]
*  Humans, a hundred thousand years ago, our species was not alone. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1514.0s)]
*  There were at least four to five other human species. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1518.0s)]
*  And the question then becomes, well, why are we the only one left? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1522.0s)]
*  And we think, and what dogs point to is that we were the friendliest species that ever evolved among humans and that we survived because we are friendly. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1526.0s)]
*  Survival of the friendliest, a successful evolutionary strategy many humans today would be wise to remember. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1538.0s)]
*  When we come back, see how the genetic ties between dogs and humans may help us both in the fight against cancer. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1546.0s)]
*  If you've ever lost a dog to disease, it may well have been cancer. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1553.0s)]
*  Some four million dogs in the US are diagnosed with it every year, often the same kinds of cancers humans get. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1567.0s)]
*  We share many of the same genes with our canine companions. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1574.0s)]
*  And for cancer research, that's an opportunity scientists are trying to make the most of. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1577.0s)]
*  It's called comparative oncology. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1582.0s)]
*  Now funded in part by the White House's Cancer Moonshot Initiative, doctors and scientists are studying naturally developing cancers, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1584.0s)]
*  mostly in dogs and using what they learn to speed potential treatments to them and us. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1592.0s)]
*  A dog show might seem like an odd place to conduct cancer research. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1599.0s)]
*  Can I see your face? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1603.0s)]
*  But this summer in Norwalk, Connecticut, that's where we met scientists from the National Institutes of Health, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1604.0s)]
*  swabbing and collecting DNA samples from all sorts of breeds. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1610.0s)]
*  Oh, awesome. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1614.0s)]
*  They've been doing this for nearly 30 years and have collected about 40,000 samples so far. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1615.0s)]
*  Every few weeks we're at a dog show. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1620.0s)]
*  Leading the team is Elaine Ostrander, a senior geneticist at the NIH. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1622.0s)]
*  I always thought the National Institutes of Health study human diseases. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1627.0s)]
*  Why is there a scientist at the NIH studying dogs? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1630.0s)]
*  We are studying human disease and we're doing it through dogs. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1633.0s)]
*  And so dogs live in our world. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1636.0s)]
*  They get all the same disease as we do. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1638.0s)]
*  They eat our food. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1640.0s)]
*  They're exposed to the same environmental pollutants. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1641.0s)]
*  But they also have all the same genes that we do. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1644.0s)]
*  And they have mutations in those genes that make them susceptible to everything you and I get, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1647.0s)]
*  whether it's diabetes or cancer or neuromuscular diseases, everything humans get, dogs get. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1651.0s)]
*  Ostrander says it's easier to study genes in dogs than humans because for the last 200 years, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1658.0s)]
*  they've been bred to emphasize specific traits. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1664.0s)]
*  That's why they have all these distinct noses and tails and sizes from Great Danes to Chihuahuas. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1667.0s)]
*  So before Victorian times, dogs were pretty much the same? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1674.0s)]
*  So there was some variation. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1678.0s)]
*  We know that from fossil and archeologic records. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1680.0s)]
*  But almost all the variation you see running around in the rings today, that's all happened in the last 200 years. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1682.0s)]
*  It's really incredible that there's so much variety in that short of time. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1688.0s)]
*  Right. So that means it's probably going to be a really small number of genes responsible for most of the major differences. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1690.0s)]
*  It turns out just one gene determines if a dog has cream colored hair or black. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1696.0s)]
*  Other genes determine long hair or short. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1701.0s)]
*  And Ostrander's team at the NIH has discovered some physical traits in dogs, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1704.0s)]
*  like ear position holds surprising clues about human health. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1708.0s)]
*  This was a study looking at prick ears versus floppy ears. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1712.0s)]
*  And that's due to a mutation in one gene called MSRB3. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1717.0s)]
*  So just a mutation in one gene. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1721.0s)]
*  One gene. Isn't that amazing? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1723.0s)]
*  Makes the difference between pointy ears and floppy ears. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1725.0s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1727.0s)]
*  But what's really interesting about this story is that when this gene is perturbed or more dramatically mutated in humans, we get a form of deafness. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1728.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1737.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1738.0s)]
*  Ostrander told us some of the most promising genetic research in dogs involves cancer. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1739.0s)]
*  Some breeds get certain types of cancers more often, making it easier for researchers to locate some of the genes responsible. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1744.0s)]
*  Scottish Terriers, for instance, are about 20 times more likely to get bladder cancer than the average mixed breed dog. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1751.0s)]
*  Now, if I were to look at a group of humans with bladder cancer, the story would be so much more complex. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1758.0s)]
*  There would be different genes in different populations. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1763.0s)]
*  There'd be different mutations, different contributions of environmental effects. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1766.0s)]
*  So when I look in one breed, I get much simpler stories. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1769.0s)]
*  Dogs are diagnosed with many of the same cancers found in humans. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1773.0s)]
*  Lymphoma, melanoma, brain and breast cancer, and the deadly bone cancer, osteosarcoma. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1777.0s)]
*  And then what about the chemotherapy? How did he do with that? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1783.0s)]
*  University of Pennsylvania professor and veterinarian Nicola Mason oversees a national network of comparative oncology trials funded by the White House's Cancer Moonshot Initiative. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1787.0s)]
*  She showed us just how similar osteosarcoma looks in dogs and people. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1798.0s)]
*  So what you can see, there's lots of purple dots here. These are the nuclei of the cancerous cells. They look identical. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1803.0s)]
*  Yeah. Even a professional looking under a microscope would not be able to tell the difference between a dog with osteosarcoma and a human. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1810.0s)]
*  Correct. Incredibly similar. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1817.0s)]
*  Osteosarcoma is aggressive and malignant. More than 10,000 dogs in the United States are estimated to get it each year, but only about a thousand people are, mostly children and young adults. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1820.0s)]
*  Christy Gomes was diagnosed in 2020 when she was 11. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1832.0s)]
*  Which was the leg that was hurting? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1836.0s)]
*  The left. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1838.0s)]
*  So it was hurting up in your thigh? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1839.0s)]
*  It was up in like here. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1840.0s)]
*  Christy was used to getting bruised on the soccer field, so she and her mom, Kathy Federer, chalked it up to a sports injury. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1842.0s)]
*  But after months of physical therapy, her doctor discovered osteosarcoma, that white mass, had eroded most of Christy's thigh bone. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1848.0s)]
*  She comes in and she goes, Christy has a cancerous tumor in her femur. And I was like, what? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1857.0s)]
*  And I was, I'm not like a crier, so I like, I think I was processing it and as I was processing it, I saw her cry, so then I started crying. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1865.0s)]
*  And then she was like, wait, I have cancer? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1872.0s)]
*  Doctors removed the remaining bone and replaced it with this nine inch metal rod. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1875.0s)]
*  Good job. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1880.0s)]
*  Months of grueling chemotherapy withered Christy to 72 pounds. But her pediatric oncologist, Dr. Alyssa Rubin, told us the cancer came back, this time in Christy's lungs. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1881.0s)]
*  Patients, once their tumor comes back, are really high risk. Probably 80 percent of the time we'll get new tumors. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1893.0s)]
*  Have there been a lot of new treatments for osteosarcoma? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1898.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, no. We've been using the same chemotherapy for about the last 60 years or so. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1901.0s)]
*  Really? Is that because it's a rare form of cancer? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1906.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's harder to study because there's smaller numbers of patients to study in large trials. And also, since it's rare, not a lot of funding goes to a lot of trials for it. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1910.0s)]
*  But there were trials in pet dogs of an experimental immunotherapy treatment for osteosarcoma that began in 2012, led by Dr. Nicola Mason, using the bacteria Listeria. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1920.0s)]
*  This is Listeria, causes food poisoning. This particular Listeria has been genetically modified so that it is far less virulent. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1932.0s)]
*  The Listeria has also been modified to contain a specific protein called HER2 that's found on some osteosarcoma cells. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1941.0s)]
*  Once injected into the dog's bloodstream, the Listeria awakens their immune systems, making them feel sick. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1949.0s)]
*  It also triggers killer immune cells to patrol the body and destroy the cancerous cells. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1955.0s)]
*  Sandy, a nine-year-old Golden Retriever, joined a nationwide trial in 2018. She's had her front leg amputated because of osteosarcoma. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1961.0s)]
*  We met her this past August with her owner, Matt Olson. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1970.0s)]
*  During the trial, Dr. Mason told us Sandy's immune system reacted to the Listeria just as she'd hoped. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1974.0s)]
*  Her body temperature started to increase, peaked around about four hours, and then started to drop down again. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1980.0s)]
*  We sort of want to see that because it tells us that the immunotherapy is in fact stimulating her immune response, which is what we want to happen. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1986.0s)]
*  When Sandy was first diagnosed, her life expectancy with the standard care of amputation and chemotherapy was around a year. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=1996.0s)]
*  But that was four years ago. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2004.0s)]
*  There's no sign of cancer. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2006.0s)]
*  No. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2008.0s)]
*  And you've had four great years with her. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2009.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2010.0s)]
*  Did she get like extra treats when she got through it all? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2011.0s)]
*  She got everything. She still does. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2014.0s)]
*  I bet she did. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2017.0s)]
*  Dr. Mason believes studying and treating naturally occurring cancers in pet dogs is more promising compared to using lab mice, which have to be artificially given cancer. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2019.0s)]
*  What we're trying to do is find a better way to determine which are the best treatments to take forward into the human. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2029.0s)]
*  This is not giving dogs rare forms of cancer and then studying them and testing them in a lab. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2039.0s)]
*  Exactly. So these are naturally occurring cancers. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2047.0s)]
*  These are clinical trials, just as you or I would go on to a clinical trial if we had a cancer. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2050.0s)]
*  And we do exactly the same in the veterinary field. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2058.0s)]
*  Results from the first Listeria trial in pet dogs were encouraging, showing the dogs tolerated the immunotherapy and that it significantly increased duration of survival time. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2060.0s)]
*  Those results were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2071.0s)]
*  Let's just confirm your birthday. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2074.0s)]
*  Last year, the FDA approved a phase two clinical trial using modified Listeria to treat young adults and children like Christy Gomes, who have recurrent osteosarcoma that spread to their lungs. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2076.0s)]
*  All right. Do you want cartoons on the TV? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2088.0s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2090.0s)]
*  We were with Christy in August at Children's Hospital of Orange County when she received her third Listeria infusion. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2091.0s)]
*  That star in the dark circle, that's the needle going into your vein. Kind of cool, huh? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2097.0s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2103.0s)]
*  First, she was given medications that made her sleepy. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2104.0s)]
*  When the infusion's actually happening, do you remember it afterward or do you just paisley sleep through it? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2107.0s)]
*  Just sleep. And then when I wake up, it hits like a truck. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2112.0s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2115.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2116.0s)]
*  You get a headache. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2117.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Bad headache. And nauseous. And I hate nauseous and headache. Two things I don't like is two things guaranteed. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2118.0s)]
*  Once she was dozing, the Listeria started dripping into Christy's IV. So it started now. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2126.0s)]
*  It happened. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2132.0s)]
*  It's kind of amazing to think that you're both on the cutting edge of medicine. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2135.0s)]
*  I know. And I don't think she realizes how important this is. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2140.0s)]
*  An hour later, that truck Christy told us about, it hit her hard. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2155.0s)]
*  But similar to what happened to Sandy, the golden retriever, the Listeria appeared to awaken Christy's immune system. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2160.0s)]
*  And after 10 minutes, her headache got better. A few hours later, she was able to leave the hospital. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2167.0s)]
*  It's so amazing to me how similar humans and dogs' immune response is. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2173.0s)]
*  We're very similar. You know, I think perhaps more so than we might like to admit. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2178.0s)]
*  The National Cancer Institute is spending more than $20 million to analyze cancer samples from pet dogs all over the country [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2184.0s)]
*  and oversee comparative oncology trials to improve treatments in humans and dogs. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2191.0s)]
*  One of their targets is brain cancer. This is Otto, a seven-year-old boxer who belongs to Dan Heffron. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2197.0s)]
*  Otto was diagnosed with a deadly brain tumor in 2021. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2204.0s)]
*  Take the pointer finger on your left hand and touch your nose. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2208.0s)]
*  And this is Julie Hinseth, who's 59. She was diagnosed in 2020 with a similar, nearly incurable brain cancer, glioblastoma. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2211.0s)]
*  She's had surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, but the cancer came back. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2220.0s)]
*  Julie and Otto enrolled in clinical trials at the University of Minnesota that use virtually the same experimental treatment. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2225.0s)]
*  A neurosurgeon and veterinary surgeon teamed up to treat and operate on Otto and other dogs with brain cancer [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2233.0s)]
*  and then shared their data about safety and dosing with a neuro-oncologist treating Julie and others. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2240.0s)]
*  Hi. Hi, Otto. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2246.0s)]
*  Julie, along with her husband Doug and daughter Kelly, met Otto for the first time last spring. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2248.0s)]
*  Two patients, similar cancers, different species. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2254.0s)]
*  What's it like to meet Otto? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2258.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm crying, you know. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2260.0s)]
*  Inflammation in Julie's brain makes it difficult for her to speak. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2266.0s)]
*  I never thought I would be having a conversation with a person and a dog who were having the same treatment. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2270.0s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2277.0s)]
*  I didn't realize until now. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2278.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I didn't tell after his first surgery what sort of an impact that he was going to have, not only for him, but other dogs and humans. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2283.0s)]
*  But two months after that meeting, Otto's symptoms worsened. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2296.0s)]
*  It appeared his cancer returned. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2299.0s)]
*  Dan took him for a final swim in his favorite river and then said goodbye to the dog he called his best friend and a medical pioneer. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2302.0s)]
*  Good, Otto. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2310.0s)]
*  Julie Hinseth's symptoms have now worsened as well. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2312.0s)]
*  She stopped taking part in the trial and is spending time with her family. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2315.0s)]
*  She told us she's grateful to have been part of an innovative interspecies battle to find new treatments. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2319.0s)]
*  I helped fight cancer. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2325.0s)]
*  It gives you satisfaction to know that you helped fight cancer. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2329.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2332.0s)]
*  I've had two dogs who have had cancer and the idea that that cancer can be studied and treated and it can have an impact on humans is incredible. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2333.0s)]
*  Maybe the key, right? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2343.0s)]
*  Yeah, dogs may hold the key. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2346.0s)]
*  Kristi Gomes, who's now well into her freshman year in high school, says she agrees. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2348.0s)]

*  It's not just that they need us for food and that there's a real connection. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2356.0s)]
*  It's not just that we're besties, it's that we have to have more connection than that. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2359.0s)]
*  Kristi's last scan showed no signs of cancer. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2363.0s)]
*  She continues to get immunotherapy every three weeks. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2367.0s)]
*  Benny, come here. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2370.0s)]
*  Between treatments and homework, you'll find her with her Yorkie Benny, a gift from her mom. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2371.0s)]
*  One more dog that's helping her in her recovery. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4iKxjmJU&t=2377.0s)]
