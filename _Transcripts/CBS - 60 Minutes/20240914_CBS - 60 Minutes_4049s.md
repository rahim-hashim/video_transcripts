# Stolen Art, Artifacts and Diamonds | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [September 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8)
*  The theft of Cambodia's cultural treasures, thousands of sacred stone, bronze, and gold [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=0.0s)]
*  artifacts from religious sites across the country, might just be the greatest art heist [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=17.78s)]
*  in history. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=22.68s)]
*  It began nearly a century ago when Cambodia was colonized by France, but in the 1970s, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=24.2s)]
*  1980s, and 1990s, amidst genocide, civil war, and political turmoil, the looting became [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=29.8s)]
*  a global business, much of it run by a British man named Douglas Latchford. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=35.36s)]
*  He kept some of it for himself, but much of what his gang of thieves stole, Latchford [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=40.8s)]
*  then sold to wealthy private collectors and some of the most important museums around [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=45.64s)]
*  the world. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=50.28s)]
*  As we first reported in December, Cambodia's government has spent the last 10 years trying [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=51.46s)]
*  to track it all down and bring their history and heritage home. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=56.38s)]
*  Angkor Wat, with its towering spires, is the glory of Cambodia. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=62.86s)]
*  Nearly a thousand years old, it's one of the biggest and most extraordinary religious [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=67.58s)]
*  temples in the world, sprawling across 400 acres. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=71.42s)]
*  Originally built to honor the Hindu god Vishnu, it then became a Buddhist temple and remains [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=76.54s)]
*  a place of worship today. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=81.5s)]
*  You can wander here for weeks, lost in a labyrinth of ancient stone corridors and sacred chambers, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=84.06s)]
*  but the scars of plunder run deep. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=90.58s)]
*  Looters have hacked off the heads of many statues. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=93.56s)]
*  They've stolen bodies as well. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=96.34s)]
*  Empty pedestals mark where gods and deities once stood. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=98.7s)]
*  On some, only the feet remain. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=102.48s)]
*  It's worse in the rest of Cambodia's 4,000 temples. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=108.14s)]
*  Nearly all have been looted. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=111.78s)]
*  This one is 100 miles northeast of Angkor Wat on a remote mountain called Sandak. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=115.58s)]
*  This was hit very heavily by the looting gangs. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=121.28s)]
*  They found gold, they found statues, they found many, many things. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=123.42s)]
*  That's Brad Gordon, an American lawyer who's been working for the Cambodian government [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=128.72s)]
*  for 10 years, tracking down its stolen treasures. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=132.86s)]
*  He brought us to Sandak with his team of investigators, archaeologists and art scholars. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=137.16s)]
*  In the temple's crumbling courtyard, little remains, mostly empty pedestals scattered [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=143.7s)]
*  among the sralao trees. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=148.68s)]
*  It's remarkable to me just how much stuff is just scattered on the ground. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=150.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a pedestal graveyard. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=153.88s)]
*  We've all seen in museums these statues with no feet on them, and I don't think people [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=157.4s)]
*  realize the feet were hacked off because in order to steal them, that's the easiest way [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  to get them off the pedestal. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  We know when the looters came to sites like this, the first thing they took was the heads. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=170.52s)]
*  That was the easiest to grab. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=174.88s)]
*  And then later on, maybe they come back and get the torso, but they were not very careful, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=176.96s)]
*  so they left behind pieces. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  For Cambodians, these statues are not just works of art. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=186.72s)]
*  They are sacred deities that hold the souls of their ancestors to whom they ask for guidance [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=189.76s)]
*  and pray. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=195.04s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=196.04s)]
*  These were all looted? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=197.78s)]
*  Yes, all looted. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=199.2s)]
*  All of these heads cut off? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  The head was cut off, yes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  Phu Rung Sakana, Cambodia's minister of culture, is in charge of the government's efforts to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=204.0s)]
*  track down their stolen gods. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  We met her in a closely guarded warehouse not far from Angkor Wat, where more than 6,000 [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=211.62s)]
*  pieces from temples across the country are stored for safekeeping, each one sculpted [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=216.84s)]
*  by an artisan from an ancient Khmer empire that lasted for more than five centuries and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  spanned Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=227.52s)]
*  So the statues have a soul. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=231.3s)]
*  The statues are, are they living? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=232.56s)]
*  Of course, yes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=234.84s)]
*  And we believe that we can talk with them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  They will hear. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=239.44s)]
*  They will see. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=240.44s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=242.28s)]
*  What do you see? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=243.28s)]
*  What do you do in your life, in your home, outside, in the society also? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=244.62s)]
*  They're watching. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  They're watching everywhere. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=251.70000000000002s)]
*  Phu Rung Sakana's entire family was killed in the genocide that began in 1975 when the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  Khmer Rouge, a radical communist group, took over, forcing millions of Cambodians into [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=260.02s)]
*  labor camps. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=265.44s)]
*  Some two million people, nearly a quarter of the population, were slaughtered or starved [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=267.26s)]
*  to death. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=272.04s)]
*  The Khmer Rouge lost power in 1979, but fighting and instability continued for decades, leaving [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=273.46000000000004s)]
*  Cambodia's temples unprotected and vulnerable, easy targets for unscrupulous antiquities [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=279.54s)]
*  dealers like Douglas Latchford. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=285.26000000000005s)]
*  Who was Douglas Latchford? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=287.68s)]
*  I would say that he was in many ways the mastermind behind the greatest art heist in history. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=288.68s)]
*  The greatest art heist in history? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=295.44s)]
*  In terms of scope and multitude of crime sites and the enormous amount of statues that were [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=297.3s)]
*  taken out. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  Latchford lived in Thailand, an enigmatic British businessman he began collecting in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=306.16s)]
*  the 1960s. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=310.72s)]
*  He had, it seems, two great loves, Cambodian antiquities and Thai bodybuilders, who sponsored [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=312.68s)]
*  Bangkok's biggest bodybuilding competition, the Latchford Classic. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=320.92s)]
*  How would you describe him? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  He was extremely deceptive. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  I think in many ways was ruthless. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=330.0s)]
*  But he hid that behind this incredible facade of charm. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=332.88s)]
*  Latchford portrayed himself as a scholar and protector of Cambodia's culture, a reputation [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=338.64s)]
*  he burnished by donating sculptures to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=343.46s)]
*  other prestigious institutions. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=347.8s)]
*  He also published three books filled with the finest examples of Cambodian antiquities. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=350.18s)]
*  Many of them, it turns out, Latchford had stolen. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=355.48s)]
*  He was using the books as sales catalogs. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=358.6s)]
*  He was handing them out. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  He was using them to sell pieces. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=362.8s)]
*  And he understood a certain psychology of collectors out there that if they see something [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=365.04s)]
*  in a beautiful book, they think it's legitimate. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  Those books have been an invaluable guide for Brad Gordon and his team, helping them [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=375.32s)]
*  compile a database of thousands of missing artifacts, many of which they didn't know [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=379.66s)]
*  existed until Latchford published photos of them. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=384.32s)]
*  Gordon's team got their big break when they met this man in 2012. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=387.68s)]
*  He was a former Khmer Rouge child soldier and leader of a gang of looters. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=391.52s)]
*  His name was Day Duck. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=396.44s)]
*  That first meeting, I didn't really know who we had met. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=398.32s)]
*  I knew that he was important. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=402.28s)]
*  I knew that many people were telling me he was the best. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=404.52s)]
*  And I knew that he was feared. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=408.88s)]
*  Why were people afraid of him? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=410.38s)]
*  Over the years, he had killed many people. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=412.0s)]
*  It turned out Day Duck had worked for decades supplying Douglas Latchford with thousands [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  of treasures, and he was amazed to see them again in Latchford's books. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=419.32s)]
*  He kept opening the book and going back to the front cover and going through and tapping [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  and saying, I know this one, I know this one, I know this one. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=429.67999999999995s)]
*  And when he says he knew this one, means he helped loot those ones? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  That's what we learned later, yeah. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  Day Duck became a key confidential source for Gordon's team. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=441.76s)]
*  They gave him a code name, Lion, to protect his identity and followed him to dozens of [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=445.52s)]
*  temples where he confessed what he'd found and how he'd stolen it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=450.52s)]
*  He would say to us, I'm going to transfer everything in my head to you. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=455.24s)]
*  I'm going to tell you everything, every secret. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=459.56s)]
*  You felt like his memory was very good. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=462.59999999999997s)]
*  It was accurate. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=464.24s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=465.24s)]
*  He remembered the size of everything, measured against his body. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=466.24s)]
*  He would use his arm to show us how long a statue was. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=470.96s)]
*  Why do you think he wanted to cooperate? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=474.0s)]
*  You know, he felt tremendously guilty about many things he had done in his life, about [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  the killing, about the looting. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  And we offered him a road of redemption, a way to do something really good at the end [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  of his life. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=490.56s)]
*  They recorded hundreds of hours of Lion's testimony. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=494.52s)]
*  He explained how gangs of looters would spend weeks at remote temples, using shovels, chisels, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=497.76000000000005s)]
*  metal detectors, even dynamite to find and dig out treasures. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=503.16s)]
*  Dozens of men would hoist heavy stone statues onto ox carts before transporting them across [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  the border into Thailand and into the hands of Douglas Lashford. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=513.12s)]
*  Lion never met Lashford, but he'd sent him photographs of artifacts he could choose from. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=518.2s)]
*  We hear about them saying, oh, we had to go to this temple and take a photo and then [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=523.48s)]
*  sending it back. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=527.6s)]
*  You know, my sense is he was shopping. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=528.6s)]
*  He had a list. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=531.0s)]
*  The looters knew his priorities. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=532.16s)]
*  Like these, which came from a temple complex called Kokei, the statues from there had a [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=535.0s)]
*  distinctive style that Lashford loved. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=540.32s)]
*  It was, however, a dangerous business. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=543.94s)]
*  Most looters only made enough to buy food for their families, and fighting between rival [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=546.6s)]
*  gangs was common. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=550.9200000000001s)]
*  People were killed over these antiquities. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=553.0s)]
*  Do you look at these as blood statues? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=556.12s)]
*  For sure. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=557.8s)]
*  They're blood antiquities. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=558.8s)]
*  Whenever I see a statue, I think about, you know, who died to get this out of the ground [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=561.28s)]
*  or get it out of a temple and to move it here? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=567.2s)]
*  So much of this looting was done in the shadow of the war, shadow of the genocide. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=570.2s)]
*  It was this 500-pound sandstone warrior from Kokei that appeared in a Sotheby's auction [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=574.64s)]
*  in 2011 that put Douglas Lashford on the radar of U.S. law enforcement. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=580.4s)]
*  Its feet were missing, and the price tag? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=585.9200000000001s)]
*  An estimated $2 to $3 million. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=588.6800000000001s)]
*  When it appeared in the market, there were a number of archaeologists, a number of people [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=591.8000000000001s)]
*  who immediately recognized the source of the statue as being a specific temple in Cambodia. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=596.24s)]
*  It came from Kokei. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=604.1600000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=605.5600000000001s)]
*  While he retired last September, J.P. Labatt was a special agent on the Cultural Property, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=607.36s)]
*  Art and Antiquities Unit with Homeland Security. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=612.1600000000001s)]
*  A team from the U.S. Attorney's Office at the Southern District of New York traveled [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=615.7600000000001s)]
*  to Cambodia to inspect the site where the statue had been removed. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  And so the base was still there with the feet still in the ground. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=625.72s)]
*  And so they were able to match that base and feet to the statue. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=629.72s)]
*  And that was enough evidence to get the statue pulled off the market. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=637.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=640.68s)]
*  After years of legal wrangling, Sotheby's finally agreed to send this stolen warrior [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=642.4399999999999s)]
*  back to Cambodia. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=647.56s)]
*  A ceremony was held welcoming it home, and investigators were able to trace its original [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  sale back to Douglas Lashford, who was asked about its repatriation in a German documentary [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=656.0999999999999s)]
*  in 2014. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=661.64s)]
*  Is it a good day for Cambodia or is it a bad day for the art market if these things are [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=663.02s)]
*  coming back? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=667.14s)]
*  It's a good day for Cambodia. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=668.98s)]
*  It's a bad day for the art market. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=670.5799999999999s)]
*  Law enforcement in New York was closing in on Lashford, but he claimed prosecutors had [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=672.66s)]
*  him all wrong. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=677.6999999999999s)]
*  Their imagination has gone wild. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=679.18s)]
*  They've seen too many Indiana Jones films. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=682.5s)]
*  As far as I know, there is no such thing as a smuggling network. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=685.56s)]
*  I certainly don't belong to any smuggling network. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=690.78s)]
*  The attempted sale of this statue in 2011, was that a turning point in the unraveling [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=694.1s)]
*  of Douglas Lashford? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=700.9s)]
*  I would say yes. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=701.9s)]
*  That case put more of a focus and a spotlight on him, and then efforts were then doubled [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=703.3199999999999s)]
*  to like really peel back the onion and look into Lashford's activities. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=708.9399999999999s)]
*  The testimony of former looters found by Brad Gordon and his team was critical for the U.S. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=715.1s)]
*  case against Lashford. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=720.22s)]
*  How rare is it to actually have access to the looters, to people who actually stole [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=722.38s)]
*  these things 10, 20, 30 years ago? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=728.02s)]
*  I know of no other case where that's happened, and it's quite remarkable to have looters [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=730.78s)]
*  actively assisting a team of investigators to recover artifacts that they had a first [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=737.4200000000001s)]
*  hand in helping remove from the country. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=743.9s)]
*  Douglas Lashford was finally indicted by U.S. authorities in 2019 for smuggling, conspiracy, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=747.8199999999999s)]
*  wire fraud and other charges, but he died before he could be put on trial. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=753.38s)]
*  Brad Gordon eventually convinced Lashford's family to return his personal collection of [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=760.02s)]
*  stolen treasures. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=764.1s)]
*  Among the first pieces to come home in 2021 was this statue from Kokei. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=766.1s)]
*  Lion, weakened by cancer, came to inspect it in Cambodia's National Museum to verify [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=773.78s)]
*  it was the same one he'd dug out of the ground. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=779.78s)]
*  And then he turned to me and he said, it's the real statue. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=783.1s)]
*  You know, it was a remarkable thing to watch. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=787.38s)]
*  And just his relationship, it was living to him. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=791.42s)]
*  Do you think he was happy it was back? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=795.98s)]
*  Thrilled. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=798.02s)]
*  So happy. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=799.02s)]
*  He knew that he had done something good. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=800.42s)]
*  Lion died a few months later, but the secrets he revealed continue to bring statues back [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=803.6999999999999s)]
*  to Cambodia's National Museum, masterpieces that left the country long before these school [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=809.3s)]
*  children were born. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=814.9799999999999s)]
*  Does the return of these statues, these gods, help to heal? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=816.78s)]
*  Yes, to get back the soul of the nation. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=821.3s)]
*  The soul of the nation? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=824.66s)]
*  It's not only for me, but for my family who died during the war. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=825.66s)]
*  And for all Cambodian people. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=831.14s)]
*  There are still many more stolen Cambodian statues and artifacts in museums and private [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=834.8199999999999s)]
*  collections around the world. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=839.4599999999999s)]
*  When we return, Cambodians fight to get those looted relics back. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=841.3399999999999s)]
*  It's taken a team of Cambodian investigators led by Brad Gordon, an American lawyer, more [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=856.54s)]
*  than 10 years to document the theft of thousands of ancient statues and relics by a British [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=863.3s)]
*  collector named Douglas Latchford. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=868.88s)]
*  As we reported last December, they've managed to get some of what he stole back, but many [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=871.38s)]
*  of Cambodia's greatest treasures are still out there, hidden away in the mansions of [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=876.3399999999999s)]
*  millionaires and billionaires and hiding in plain sight on display in some of the most [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=881.44s)]
*  prestigious museums around the world. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=887.2s)]
*  The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has one of the most important collections [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=891.2s)]
*  of Cambodian antiquities in the world, but many of the finest pieces on display here [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=895.24s)]
*  in the Southeast Asian art wing are stolen, like this one and this one, this as well, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=900.7600000000001s)]
*  all passed through the hands of Douglas Latchford. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=908.1600000000001s)]
*  Latchford sold this one to the Met in the early 1990s. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=912.04s)]
*  This one he donated. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=914.76s)]
*  Do you think people visiting the Met know that these were looted? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=915.76s)]
*  I think most people walk through the Met, they have no idea those are blood antiquities. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=919.84s)]
*  They have no idea what the history is behind those pieces. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=923.8s)]
*  They don't know the temples they came from. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=926.82s)]
*  They don't know the people who were killed to get them here. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=929.44s)]
*  The dirt has been brushed off. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=931.92s)]
*  There's a little note that says where it came from. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=934.04s)]
*  Should people believe what's on that little note? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=937.6s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=939.8s)]
*  Last year we went with Brad Gordon to see where in Cambodia the Met and other museums' [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=942.3199999999999s)]
*  collections really did come from. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=947.16s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=949.56s)]
*  This seven-story pyramid is more than a thousand years old and rises out of the jungle in Kho Khe [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=951.36s)]
*  in northeast Cambodia. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=957.0s)]
*  It's one of dozens of temples and what was once the capital of an ancient Khmer Empire. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=959.1999999999999s)]
*  Looters have been all over this site for decades. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=964.88s)]
*  Correct. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=967.64s)]
*  Douglas Latchford loved the statuary. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=968.96s)]
*  In love with the beauty, in love with the artistic. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=971.48s)]
*  The statues from here have a distinctive style that he particularly loved. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=973.52s)]
*  Correct. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=977.16s)]
*  And perhaps the most famous statues in that distinctive style that Latchford stole from [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=978.24s)]
*  Kho Khe were nine stone warriors, once arranged together in a battle scene. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=982.64s)]
*  Today seven have been returned to the National Museum in Phnom Penh, including this 500-pound [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=988.72s)]

*  What do you think of this house? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1081.54s)]
*  It's a beautiful house, he said. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1083.3s)]
*  It looks like it belongs to a king. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1085.0s)]
*  The former looters pointed out another statue in the Lindemann's living room they said they [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1087.7s)]
*  helped steal, this reclining figure of the Hindu god Vishnu. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1092.02s)]
*  They said it was dug out of the ground from this exact spot in late 1995. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1096.44s)]
*  You're 100% sure this was taken from here by you and others in 1995? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1101.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1107.02s)]
*  They also identified a number of other statues they say they stole that appear in books published [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1111.52s)]
*  by Douglas Latchford. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1116.72s)]
*  They say they found this copper statue using a metal detector. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1118.56s)]
*  This is Burisat Faidi's? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1122.16s)]

*  Latchford sold it to the Met in 1992. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1136.54s)]
*  And here it is still on display. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1139.8400000000001s)]
*  You were able to get access to some of Latchford's emails? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1142.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1145.8400000000001s)]
*  And in there, there are detailed stories about the manner in which he obtained pieces, the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1146.8400000000001s)]
*  fact that he was having them reassembled and repaired, that dirt and crustaceans were being [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1155.8s)]
*  cleaned off of them. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1162.14s)]
*  They were freshly dug out of the ground? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1163.42s)]
*  These were fresh pieces that he would describe in his emails that needed a level of restoration [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1165.84s)]
*  before he could even attempt to sell them. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1171.26s)]
*  Douglas Latchford was indicted in 2019 but died before he could be put on trial. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1174.74s)]
*  Federal prosecutors in New York, however, continue tracing his looted artifacts. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1180.1s)]
*  They believe at least 18 of them have landed up at the Met. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1184.22s)]
*  I am very involved in our work on provenance. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1188.94s)]
*  Andrea Bayer is deputy director for collections and administration at the Met. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1192.9799999999998s)]
*  The Met has said that they will return objects based upon rigorous evidentiary review. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1196.82s)]
*  What rigorous evidentiary review was done before acquiring these pieces? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1203.1s)]
*  Not enough. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1208.34s)]
*  It seems like the Met had a don't ask, don't tell policy. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1209.5s)]
*  They wanted to build up their collection and nobody was really asking questions where it [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1212.1s)]
*  came from. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1215.9799999999998s)]
*  For people, many people in the art world, there was a sense of protecting great objects [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1217.14s)]
*  that stood a chance of being destroyed. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1223.9s)]
*  We no longer feel about it that way. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1226.34s)]
*  Under pressure ten years ago, the Met did return two statues called kneeling attendants, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1229.14s)]
*  which had been donated to them by Douglas Latchford. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1234.18s)]
*  In 2013, when you returned the kneeling attendants, did you investigate the other items that Douglas [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1237.06s)]
*  Latchford had brought to this museum? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1242.9s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that question. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1244.58s)]
*  I can only pick up the story several years later when Douglas Latchford was indicted [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1246.78s)]
*  in 2019 when we immediately and proactively went to the U.S. Attorney's Office and offered [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1252.1s)]
*  our full cooperation. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1258.1s)]
*  Well, I can pick up the story actually in 2013 because a spokesman for the Met said [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1259.1s)]
*  that no special effort was going to be made to check the provenances of any other Douglas [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1264.3s)]
*  Latchford donated work. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1268.42s)]
*  Why wouldn't the Met want to look into everything else that Douglas Latchford had brought to [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1271.54s)]
*  this museum? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1276.38s)]
*  I can't speculate about why that didn't happen. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1277.38s)]
*  But no one investigated all the other items that Douglas Latchford gave? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1280.42s)]
*  Not to my knowledge. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1285.2600000000002s)]
*  The Met is not the only major museum with looted Cambodian artifacts, but its collection [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1287.6200000000001s)]
*  is one of the largest in the world. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1292.7s)]
*  Last year, the museum announced it would create a research team to examine the provenance [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1295.1000000000001s)]
*  or acquisition history of all its collections. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1299.66s)]
*  It's taken 10 years since Douglas Latchford was shown to have given stolen property to [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1303.2s)]
*  the Met. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1309.92s)]
*  For the Met to set up this provenance team, why has it taken 10 years? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1312.0s)]
*  It was a slow process. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1319.18s)]
*  I'll grant you that. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1320.8000000000002s)]
*  It was a slow process. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1322.0800000000002s)]
*  But I think that the fact that we are fully engaged now, fully cooperative now, is our [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1324.1000000000001s)]
*  only answer to this really. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1330.8600000000001s)]
*  It's a moment of reckoning, and we're ready to do what it takes now to right whatever [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1332.56s)]
*  the wrong is. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1336.8799999999999s)]
*  Four years ago, when Douglas Latchford was indicted by prosecutors, did you set up a [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1337.8799999999999s)]
*  team to check the provenance of every Latchford work? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1342.8799999999999s)]
*  We started, absolutely. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1346.0s)]
*  We started to dig in right then and there. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1347.6799999999998s)]
*  It's not easy. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1350.58s)]
*  I mean, the fact that we don't have much information has to do with the fact that it's very hard [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1351.58s)]
*  to find the information. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1356.36s)]
*  There's enough information for federal prosecutors to charge Douglas Latchford with stealing [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1357.62s)]
*  and looting and trafficking and smuggled items. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1362.16s)]
*  How much more evidence do you need? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1365.64s)]
*  You haven't returned any of the any Douglas Latchford related items since he's been indicted. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1368.8200000000002s)]
*  And that was four years ago. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1373.44s)]
*  We are on the verge of returning a number of them. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1374.44s)]
*  All of them? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1377.8400000000001s)]
*  That I can't say. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1380.0800000000002s)]
*  That interview took place in September. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1382.3200000000002s)]
*  Two days before we went to air, prosecutors announced the Met would return 13 antiquities [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1384.6200000000001s)]
*  that came through Douglas Latchford. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1390.56s)]
*  But the Met is not returning this statue, which was specifically cited in the indictment [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1392.76s)]
*  of Latchford or this one, which Latchford sold to the Met in 1992. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1397.24s)]
*  Cambodia's culture minister called the Met's announcement a first step and says she looks [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1402.92s)]
*  forward to the return of many more of our treasures. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1407.04s)]
*  Shouldn't museums have thought twice about buying things that were coming out of Cambodia [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1410.92s)]
*  during the genocide and civil war and decades of strife? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1416.08s)]
*  And this question that you raise is really the crux of what we're wrestling with. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1420.8s)]
*  You acquired pieces from a known smuggler who used a team of looters that the government [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1426.4399999999998s)]
*  has interviewed and taken statements from. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1434.84s)]
*  They have emails which refute the information in your own provenance at the museum. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1437.9199999999998s)]
*  You have items in the museum which were named in the indictment of Latchford that are still [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1443.76s)]
*  there. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1448.8s)]
*  And so these pieces should go back. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1449.76s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1452.96s)]
*  It's the right thing to do. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1453.96s)]
*  This past September, the Lindemann family, whose collection was showcased in Architectural [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1455.98s)]
*  Digest, struck a deal with federal authorities, voluntarily agreeing to return 33 stolen treasures. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1460.08s)]
*  In a statement to the New York Times, the Lindemann said, having purchased these items [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1468.24s)]
*  from dealers that we assumed were reputable, we were saddened to learn how they made their [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1472.48s)]

*  Why did the Lindemanns agree to return their collection to Cambodia? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1479.84s)]
*  The pieces were dirty. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1482.88s)]
*  I think they finally came around to the fact that Latchford was dirty. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1484.6s)]
*  Their collection was all looted pieces. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1489.24s)]
*  It was obvious. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1491.88s)]
*  And so they decided to surrender them. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1492.88s)]
*  We got a peek at what was the Lindemann collection shortly after the deal was done. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1495.8s)]
*  It was sitting in a warehouse in upstate New York, a nation's living gods and ancestors [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1500.72s)]
*  waiting for a ride home. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1506.56s)]
*  This is like a whole wing of a museum. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1508.72s)]
*  A wing of a museum that only the Lindemanns and their friends had access to. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1510.76s)]
*  If the Lindemanns hadn't published these in Architectural Digest back in 2008... [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1516.02s)]
*  I think there's a good chance we maybe never would have found it. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1520.32s)]
*  We always say the gods want to come home. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1525.32s)]
*  We feel like the gods have spoken today. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1527.2s)]
*  They want to come home. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1529.64s)]
*  As one of the biggest crates was being opened, waiting eagerly was Moikung Tang and Tida [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1532.64s)]
*  Long, two members of Brad Gordon's investigative team. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1537.96s)]
*  This would be their first look at the mythical army commander taken from Kho Khe. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1542.2s)]
*  They were likely the first Cambodians to set eyes on it since Douglas Latchford stole it [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1546.5200000000002s)]
*  more than 50 years ago. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1552.24s)]
*  He's here! [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1554.0s)]
*  There's a look in his eyes and on his face. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1555.68s)]
*  It's much bigger than I expected it to be. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1558.0s)]
*  It's presence is extraordinary. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1560.8s)]
*  I did not expect to feel this way. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1562.56s)]
*  Even the commander seemed to be smiling. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1566.08s)]
*  Then it was time to see the rarest piece in the Lindemanns' collection. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1570.6s)]
*  The Cambodian team knelt in reverence as the Hindu god Vishnu was uncrated. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1574.8s)]
*  Despite all the fuss, he appeared unperturbed, reclining in a cosmic slumber. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1580.36s)]
*  When this statue arrives in Cambodia, it will be welcomed as one of the most important ever [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1586.36s)]
*  returned. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1592.4399999999998s)]
*  Two Cambodian artifacts donated by the Lindemann family to the Met are still on display. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1596.08s)]
*  This month, the Cambodian government submitted a list of 49 antiquities held by the Met they [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1602.0s)]
*  claim are stolen and want back. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1607.0s)]
*  In October, a UN report found new evidence that Russia had committed war crimes in Ukraine [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1618.64s)]
*  with deliberate killings and widespread use of torture. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1624.6s)]
*  But they have yet to examine the intentional destruction of cultural property, which also [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1628.56s)]
*  is a war crime. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1633.32s)]
*  Ukraine accuses Russian forces of targeting churches, libraries, and looting the country's [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1635.6s)]
*  most important museums. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1640.9199999999998s)]
*  And while plunder is as old as war itself, Ukrainian investigators say this is different. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1643.08s)]
*  They see a campaign of cultural genocide to destroy Ukraine's identity as a nation. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1650.3799999999999s)]
*  As we reported in November, a network of cultural warriors in Ukraine is building the case against [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1656.6799999999998s)]
*  Russia. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1663.1599999999999s)]
*  It's a heritage war, one told us, and we joined them on the front lines. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1664.16s)]
*  Not much was left of the tiny village of Vyazivka, a few hours northwest of Kiev, after Russian [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1671.72s)]
*  forces overwhelmed the region in 2022. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1677.68s)]
*  But we weren't prepared for this. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1681.0400000000002s)]
*  My God. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1683.8000000000002s)]
*  So, Ihor, what happened here? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1685.6000000000001s)]
*  The destruction of Ukraine by Russian occupation forces, you see. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1693.16s)]
*  What this liberation means. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1697.52s)]
*  Why would they target a church? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1699.88s)]
*  In this small village, this was the main place, and it was targeted just to destroy what keeps [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1702.3000000000002s)]
*  the whole village, the whole community together. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1709.72s)]
*  Ihor Poshavelo is director of the contemporary Maidan Museum in Kiev. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1713.16s)]
*  He'd brought us to see the carcass of the Church of the Nativity on Ukraine's heritage list. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1718.48s)]
*  Poshavelo told us the Russians had deliberately shelled it when they retreated. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1724.2s)]
*  There was no fighting nearby. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1729.24s)]
*  Built in 1862, the church had survived two world wars, communism and a revolution. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1732.04s)]
*  But not this. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1739.42s)]
*  What message do you think the Russians were trying to send by destroying this church? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1741.42s)]
*  We are strong. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1747.88s)]
*  You should be afraid of us. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1749.44s)]
*  And we will do what we want to do. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1751.44s)]
*  We don't need you on this land. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1753.74s)]
*  We don't need your traditions, beliefs, your culture. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1755.24s)]
*  You are not, you do not exist. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1758.72s)]
*  Erase you. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1760.7600000000002s)]
*  Erase you, exactly. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1761.7600000000002s)]
*  As we sifted through the wreckage, Poshavelo told us the church had been famous for its [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1764.3600000000001s)]
*  unique centuries-old folk art. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1769.0400000000002s)]
*  And these are all paintings? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1772.1200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1773.1200000000001s)]
*  You can see that they still have some depicting. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1774.12s)]
*  He told us this was one of 700 churches that have been hit so far. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1778.3999999999999s)]
*  Some were collateral damage, many were not. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1783.5s)]
*  To document the destruction, Poshavelo co-founded the Heritage Emergency Response Initiative, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1787.0s)]
*  a sort of cultural SWAT team that travels to damaged sites, interviewing eyewitnesses [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1793.2399999999998s)]
*  and saving what they can. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1799.04s)]
*  It's a nightmare for me because every morning I get up and I think that it's not reality, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1801.56s)]
*  what we have. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1807.92s)]
*  And at the same time, the feelings that we will never forgive. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1808.92s)]
*  Never forgive. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1813.64s)]
*  We'll never forgive. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1814.64s)]
*  I mean, the cultural legacy, cultural heritage, this is what makes us rich and what we have [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1815.64s)]
*  to protect and pass to future generations. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1821.92s)]
*  That's why I can see that it's one of the front lines in this war, because destroying [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1825.9s)]
*  our past, the Russians tries to destroy our future. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1831.5s)]
*  It's not only churches, hundreds of museums, libraries and monuments have been bombed, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1836.72s)]
*  burned or shelled. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1842.6200000000001s)]
*  In 2022, the Russians razed this small folk museum near Kiev to the ground. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1844.26s)]
*  Nearby buildings were untouched. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1850.42s)]
*  Farther east, Russian artillery destroyed this museum. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1854.22s)]
*  Locals carried out the only surviving statue of its patron saint, like a wounded patient. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1858.1399999999999s)]
*  Poshavelo and others told us they believe it's a strategy that comes straight from the [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1865.6599999999999s)]
*  Kremlin. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1870.3799999999999s)]
*  For years, Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly dismissed Ukraine's right to [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1871.5s)]

*  Many museum workers have been arrested, even kidnapped by Russian soldiers. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1880.58s)]
*  You don't usually think of museum workers as being in danger. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1886.1399999999999s)]
*  They are among the first people Russians come for. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1893.1s)]
*  Why? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1896.58s)]
*  Well, first of all, they are interested in the collections. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1897.58s)]
*  Where did they hide the collections? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1900.8999999999999s)]
*  What is the value of the collections? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1904.12s)]
*  The second reason is museum workers are leaders in their community. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1906.14s)]
*  Milena Chorna is head of international exhibits at the National War Museum in Kiev. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1911.7s)]
*  She helped set up a museum crisis hotline for workers in the war zone trying to save [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1917.42s)]
*  their collections. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1922.9s)]
*  They were soon swamped with calls for help, sending money for Russian bribes, devising [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1924.24s)]
*  escape routes, hiding paintings and sometimes just to talk. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1930.0200000000002s)]
*  You cut off all your emotions trying to do everything you can to help. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1936.1799999999998s)]
*  Putting it all through yourself, it is really difficult. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1941.26s)]
*  And at some point you realize, yeah, that you have a PTSD already, although you haven't [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1945.2199999999998s)]

*  Milena Chorna told us many workers actually moved into their museums to help guard the [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1951.82s)]
*  collections, even as the bombs fell. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1957.4599999999998s)]
*  In the north, during the siege of Chernihiv, she told us about one museum worker who moved [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1963.14s)]
*  in with her eight-year-old daughter. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1968.5200000000002s)]
*  There was no electricity, no water, no heat. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1970.9s)]
*  When it got really bad... [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1974.98s)]
*  Weeks later, volunteers trying to deliver a generator to the museum were killed. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1977.0200000000002s)]
*  She stayed? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1982.5800000000002s)]

*  And now she is in the army. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1986.8600000000001s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1989.0200000000002s)]
*  I believe at some point she might have acknowledged that what we are doing is not good enough. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1990.3s)]
*  And at some point we will all have to become soldiers. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=1998.54s)]

*  In Herson, Russian soldiers cut paintings from frames, dragged out priceless antiques [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2012.82s)]
*  and cleaned out more than 10,000 works of art. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2019.26s)]
*  Even so, Chernihiv told us, many museum workers wouldn't leave. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2023.02s)]
*  How can I leave these things to be looted or destroyed if I know it's the history that [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2027.54s)]

*  I might not be able to say that without emotions. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2041.06s)]
*  But I think that, well speaking of myself, I understand that the value of these items [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2045.14s)]

*  Higher than the price of your life? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2062.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2064.54s)]
*  Because the scope of effect these artifacts can have on future generations, it's incomparable [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2065.54s)]

*  When the Russians invaded, they wasted no time before heading to the museum, threatening [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2097.42s)]
*  to shoot the locks off the door to break in. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2102.58s)]

*  Undeterred, a group of soldiers turned up at the door of museum director Lila Ibramova [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2121.58s)]
*  and kidnapped her. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2127.42s)]
*  They put a bag over your head and kidnapped you? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2129.1400000000003s)]
*  I was very scared, she told us. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2134.3s)]
*  There were eight of them. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2136.82s)]
*  They were wearing balaclavas and carried machine guns. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2137.98s)]
*  One soldier did all the talking. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2141.38s)]
*  They turned my house upside down. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2143.54s)]
*  Then they put a bag on my head and put me in a car. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2146.22s)]
*  Ibramova is in hiding, so we agreed not to show her face. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2150.18s)]
*  She told us the Russians interrogated her about the museum, but she refused to cooperate. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2154.5s)]
*  They let her go, but when her name later surfaced on a Russian execution list, she fled the [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2160.58s)]
*  country. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2166.22s)]
*  My life was at risk, she told us, and staying would jeopardize my colleagues, my family. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2170.22s)]
*  I was afraid my husband and son would be searched again. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2175.62s)]
*  In the end, the Russians found the gold, 198 ancient gold artifacts worth untold millions. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2181.62s)]
*  The Russians' plunder has all the earmarks of a war crime, according to Vitaly Titish, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2189.66s)]
*  a criminal lawyer of 30 years. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2195.14s)]
*  What tells you that this was deliberate? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2197.8599999999997s)]
*  He leads a new unit of the Ukrainian military investigating Russia's targeting of heritage [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2201.9s)]
*  sites. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2206.9s)]
*  Intentionally looting or destroying cultural property during a war is a crime. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2207.9s)]
*  But Titish told us the Russians have flipped the law on its head. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2213.6200000000003s)]
*  The Russians keep saying they're evacuating these artifacts to safeguard them during the [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2222.1s)]
*  fighting, he told us, and they will return them when the war is over. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2226.7400000000002s)]
*  That is a lie, and we are ready to prove it. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2231.38s)]
*  But Titish told us he's under no illusions. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2236.34s)]
*  There have only been two convictions for cultural war crimes since the law was passed in 1954. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2239.38s)]
*  So Ukraine wants to prosecute Russia for war crimes. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2246.38s)]
*  How likely do you think they will actually be prosecuted? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2252.1s)]
*  I'm worried, he told us. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2260.14s)]
*  The international treaties to prevent war crimes have not proven effective, nor, he [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2262.3399999999997s)]
*  said, has the International Criminal Court. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2267.38s)]
*  But that's all we've got. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2269.94s)]
*  In the village of Lukashivka, outside Chernihiv, museum director Ihor Poshavelo showed us what [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2273.46s)]
*  was left after the Russians set up a base camp inside this church, a protected architectural [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2279.8199999999997s)]
*  monument. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2286.18s)]
*  This is really something. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2287.18s)]
*  In the battle to force the Russians out, a massive fire demolished the church's historic [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2288.9s)]
*  frescoes. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2294.54s)]
*  Here's also, you can see, you can see the plaster from the wall. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2295.54s)]
*  And you still have the cross here. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2299.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2301.98s)]
*  So the church itself had so many layers of history and culture. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2302.98s)]
*  But everything is lost now. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2307.94s)]
*  In the nave, look at this. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2310.54s)]
*  This was all that was left. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2313.06s)]
*  Poshavelo told us this war is about more than land. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2315.9s)]
*  This is the war against our historical memory, against our being Ukrainian. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2320.6200000000003s)]
*  You said before against your soul. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2326.6600000000003s)]
*  Against, exactly, against our soul, against everything which makes us Ukrainians, and [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2328.9s)]
*  this is from Russia. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2333.58s)]
*  And this war has the signs of being a genocide war against the Ukrainian nation. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2335.3s)]
*  Genocide? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2340.86s)]
*  You consider this genocide? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2341.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2344.1400000000003s)]
*  It's an attempt to totally destroy Ukraine and the Ukrainian nation. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2345.98s)]
*  But it will never work, Poshavelo told us. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2352.02s)]
*  The more the Russians attack, the more resilient Ukrainians become. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2354.78s)]
*  We saw proof of that at the Holy Dormition Cathedral in Kyiv. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2361.7000000000003s)]
*  A 3D laser scanner was meticulously capturing every architectural detail so that if disaster [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2366.62s)]

*  It's work that's going on across the country, saving the cultural soul of Ukraine for future [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2380.5s)]
*  generations. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2388.14s)]
*  Two years ago, German authorities conducting a routine tax investigation stumbled on the [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2390.14s)]
*  largest trove of missing art since the end of World War II. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2410.5s)]
*  The massive collection, barely a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of artworks still [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2415.02s)]
*  missing was discovered in a Munich apartment owned by Cornelius Gerlach, the reclusive [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2419.74s)]
*  81-year-old son of one of Hitler's favorite art dealers. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2425.62s)]
*  Most of it was art plundered from museums and from Jewish collections. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2430.46s)]
*  For Germans, it was an unwelcome reminder of a bitter history. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2434.62s)]
*  After the heirs of the victims, it's perhaps a last chance to recover a small vestige of [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2439.32s)]
*  family history. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2444.6200000000003s)]
*  The discovery also triggered a legal battle about who really owns that art. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2446.48s)]
*  Did you have any idea that he had so many paintings in that apartment? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2452.2400000000002s)]

*  And for the last 60 years, he was living with his paintings. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2482.84s)]

*  Picasso was just the beginning. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2500.94s)]
*  Cornelius Gerlach's secret hoard of art included modern masters like Matisse, Chagall, Franz [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2502.46s)]

*  Traveling back from Switzerland to Germany, a customs inspection brought him under suspicion [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2516.98s)]
*  and triggered a tax investigation that would be his undoing. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2522.38s)]

*  suspicious. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2533.78s)]

*  He didn't pay taxes. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2540.62s)]
*  He didn't receive any benefits. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2541.62s)]

*  Maybe he's a secret art dealer. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2562.46s)]
*  Maybe he's involved in some smuggling activities. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2564.14s)]

*  Fourteen hundred works of art, some of them worth millions. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2584.9s)]
*  They also found 80-year-old Cornelius Gerlach, a virtual hermit, who said the only friends [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2589.38s)]
*  he had in this world were his art. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2595.5s)]
*  Art thought to be worth over a billion dollars, art piled on shelves, much of it art the Nazis [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2599.5800000000004s)]
*  declared to be degenerate. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2605.46s)]
*  It was art taken from the walls of museums and from Jewish-owned galleries and collectors, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2607.78s)]
*  all of it acquired by Hildebrand Gerlach, Cornelius' father. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2613.7s)]
*  He was a leading art dealer chosen by Hitler to sell the art to customers abroad for hard [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2618.1s)]
*  currency. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2624.1s)]
*  Much of it featured in a 1937 degenerate art show in which Hitler wanted to show Germans [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2625.42s)]
*  what he regarded as the decadence and depravity of modern avant-garde art. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2632.22s)]
*  Art historian Vanessa Vogt, a specialist in art of that era, was called in by police during [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2638.2599999999998s)]
*  the raid. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2644.06s)]
*  I saw there Cornelius Gullit. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2645.06s)]
*  He is a man who is ill. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2650.74s)]
*  He was afraid and he didn't speak. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2654.96s)]
*  Cornelius sat stunned as agents went through his apartment. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2659.82s)]
*  Did he say anything to you or to the agents from the government? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2663.98s)]
*  No, he was really shocked of the situation. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2668.46s)]
*  I think in this apartment there were no people for many, many years. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2673.1000000000004s)]
*  I think there were perhaps an art dealer but no one else. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2679.26s)]
*  Did he seem to be sane? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2687.46s)]
*  Yeah, he was. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2689.9s)]
*  His cousin says after Cornelius' father died, he never allowed anyone into the apartment [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2692.78s)]
*  or his crumbling house in Salzburg, Austria, where he kept a collection of 238 works of [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2698.98s)]
*  art of immense value, like this painting by Monet. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2705.2200000000003s)]
*  He gave him the whole collection of these paintings as inheritance, right, to survive. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2709.9s)]
*  So every time Cornelius went run out of money, he sold one of these paintings. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2715.86s)]
*  Almost overlooked among the cash was a small drawing of a piano player by the German romanticist [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2721.3s)]
*  Carl Spitzweg. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2726.94s)]
*  It's one of the... [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2728.42s)]
*  It is a drawing Martha Henriksen has spent the better part of her life trying to track [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2729.42s)]
*  down. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2734.3s)]
*  The Nazis had confiscated it from her grandfather, Henri Henriksen, along with his entire art [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2735.3s)]
*  collection. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2741.54s)]
*  Before the Gerlitz collection was discovered, had you pretty much given up hope? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2742.98s)]
*  I was absolutely stunned. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2747.3s)]
*  I wasn't expecting anything like that. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2750.62s)]
*  During the raid, agents found Gerlitz's father's records from 1940, which revealed details [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2754.7s)]
*  of a sale of four works once owned by her grandfather. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2760.5s)]
*  The sale was really theft by other means. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2764.7s)]
*  Henriksen never received the money. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2767.62s)]
*  In 1942, he was gassed at Auschwitz. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2769.74s)]
*  Legally it was a sale. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2773.66s)]
*  Morally and ethically is another question, but... [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2775.7799999999997s)]
*  Was the seller having no choice? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2778.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2781.58s)]
*  Another painting Gerlitz had was Two Riders on the Beach by Max Lieberman, now valued [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2782.58s)]
*  at more than a million dollars. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2788.7799999999997s)]
*  David Toran, now 88 and blind, left Germany on a kinder transport days before the war [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2792.3799999999997s)]
*  began. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2799.02s)]
*  He last saw the painting at his uncle's home in Breslau, just before his father was arrested [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2800.2599999999998s)]
*  by the Nazis. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2806.02s)]
*  Both parents were murdered at Auschwitz. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2807.74s)]
*  There came two guys from the Gestapo. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2810.58s)]
*  We have instructions to take you to Gestapo headquarters. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2813.2599999999998s)]
*  That day I remember every little detail. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2818.86s)]
*  I was sitting in the anteroom at the Wintergarten and looked at the picture. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2822.38s)]
*  And that was the last time I saw that picture. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2829.2200000000003s)]
*  Toran had been searching for any trace of his family's art collection, but all he found [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2832.6200000000003s)]
*  was a 1939 Nazi inventory that mentions the Lieberman painting. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2837.54s)]
*  The latter says that the action to confiscate art owned by Jews has been very successful. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2843.66s)]
*  But there's still some rich Jews left. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2853.7799999999997s)]
*  And the first example he mentions my uncle. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2857.7s)]
*  And the letter ends with, I warned the Jew David Friedman not to dispose of any of the [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2861.7799999999997s)]
*  art objects until we come back. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2871.94s)]
*  After the war, the Allies Art Recovery Unit, the Monuments Men, found and returned millions [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2875.86s)]
*  of artworks. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2881.9s)]
*  They also found Hildebrand Gerlitz hiding out in this Bavarian castle owned by a local [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2883.54s)]
*  Nazi party leader. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2889.38s)]
*  Inside were hundreds of treasures Hildebrand and his young son Cornelius had hidden. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2891.78s)]
*  Many more were apparently stashed in hiding places all over Germany. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2897.74s)]
*  The Monuments Men took some of his paintings, but they let him keep most of his collection, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2902.54s)]
*  did they not? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2906.8599999999997s)]
*  That's an unresolved mystery, I think, up to this day. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2908.22s)]
*  He was able to produce one story after another about how he had acquired these before the [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2913.24s)]
*  war and for reasons that I have a hard time understanding is he got away with it. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2919.9799999999996s)]
*  Hiding the artworks in that castle was David Toren's uncle's painting. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2926.02s)]
*  Hildebrand Gerlitz told the Monuments Men it was a gift from his parents before the [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2930.66s)]
*  war. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2935.62s)]
*  And that painting, like most of the others, was returned to him. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2936.62s)]
*  Did he feel any guilt working for the Nazis? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2940.78s)]
*  I'm sorry, but he had to survive. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2943.78s)]
*  So what would you do? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2945.58s)]
*  I mean, this is just a thing. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2946.58s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2949.02s)]
*  But was he as innocent as he claimed? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2950.02s)]
*  Most of these artworks were stolen, I think, confiscated from Jewish families or stolen. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2953.02s)]
*  Hannes Hartung and Tito Park, two lawyers who've represented Cornelius Gerlitz, say [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2962.22s)]
*  the sins of the father should not be visited on the son. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2968.22s)]
*  Hildebrand Gerlitz was not completely innocent, that's for sure. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2972.18s)]
*  Now there are cases. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2976.34s)]
*  We will deal with them in a fair manner. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2978.18s)]
*  Because you know, under German law, morality has nothing to say. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2980.14s)]
*  I'm sorry to tell you that the German law, it's a law which has not been made for the [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2984.8599999999997s)]
*  horrible outcome of the Third Reich and all that happens. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2992.1s)]
*  So now what we are talking about now is about morality and how to deal with moral responsibility. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=2996.8199999999997s)]
*  German law puts a 30-year statute of limitations on stolen property, so the works by law remain [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3004.5s)]
*  the property of Cornelius Gerlitz. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3010.9s)]
*  As for the art itself, authorities won't explain why they kept the discovery a secret for nearly [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3013.82s)]
*  two years. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3019.9s)]
*  How strong is the government's criminal case against him? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3021.46s)]
*  They really don't have a strong case. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3024.9s)]
*  They pretend to have a case because they have of course to justify the seizure of the whole collection. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3028.02s)]
*  Right now the collection is in the hands of a task force which is examining each work [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3036.42s)]
*  for evidence of looting. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3041.5s)]
*  Ingrid Berggrin-Merkel heads up the task force. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3043.62s)]
*  Uwe Hartmann is the chief researcher. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3047.02s)]
*  He says even as Germany was collapsing in 1945, the Nazis were dutifully recording the art thefts. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3049.7s)]
*  Why did they keep these records of the evidence of their own crimes? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3057.7s)]
*  You must throw public documents away. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3063.2999999999997s)]
*  That's what they learned. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3066.3799999999997s)]
*  That's what they did. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3067.3799999999997s)]
*  That's the German Gründlichkeit. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3068.3799999999997s)]
*  It's his duty. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3071.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3073.3799999999997s)]
*  They weren't allowed to. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3074.3799999999997s)]
*  Until the last day. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3075.3799999999997s)]
*  The task force is initially examining 590 works as potentially looted from Jews. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3077.22s)]
*  Starting with this Matisse which was looted from Jewish art dealer Paul Rosenberg in 1941. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3085.02s)]
*  Beyond the minutiae of legality, there's a larger question and that's the moral question. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3092.22s)]
*  80 years after Hitler took over, 75 years after the synagogues burned in Germany, yes [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3097.82s)]
*  we know. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3103.34s)]
*  That's the moral obligation and we take it seriously, very seriously. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3104.34s)]
*  On the other side, there are the laws. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3109.14s)]
*  So you're not making judgments? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3111.82s)]
*  No. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3113.82s)]
*  We can't. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3115.6200000000003s)]
*  We mustn't. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3116.6200000000003s)]
*  But you can still recommend. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3117.6200000000003s)]
*  Mr. Gurlitt told me when I talked to him, he said what's been taken away, what's been [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3118.94s)]
*  robbed, was his words, has to be given back. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3124.06s)]

*  But he says he is willing to negotiate. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3137.44s)]
*  When a lot of people might wonder, there's nothing to negotiate here. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3140.26s)]
*  These paintings either belong to German museums and should go back to the German museums or [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3144.66s)]
*  to Jews who own collections and we're forced to sell them. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3150.2999999999997s)]
*  Mr. Gurlitt is absolutely willing to find fair solutions. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3153.8599999999997s)]

*  No evidence, nothing. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3172.98s)]
*  As for Martha Henriksen, she's filed a claim with the task force. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3175.26s)]
*  But has little confidence she'll ever see her grandfather's drawing. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3178.98s)]
*  Quite honestly, I don't believe in my lifetime because I think this is going to be a long, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3183.98s)]
*  long battle. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3190.46s)]
*  Cornelius Gurlitt is close to an agreement with the German authorities. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3193.62s)]
*  He's agreed to give up paintings proven to be stolen and will retain the rest. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3197.82s)]
*  The largest, most successful gang of diamond thieves in the world is credited with over [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3213.5s)]

*  And it's getting bigger and more daring every year. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3223.7000000000003s)]
*  The gang is composed of networks of teams who work together, in Europe mostly, but they've [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3226.5s)]
*  done jobs in 35 countries as far afield as Tokyo and Dubai. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3231.9s)]
*  They are ex-Yugoslavs, many fought in the Serbian Special Forces during the Bosnian [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3237.5s)]
*  wars. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3242.66s)]
*  They are called the Pink Panthers, and that's not a joke. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3243.76s)]
*  They got their name from those famous Peter Sellers movies of the 70s and 80s. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3248.14s)]
*  But as you can well imagine, there are scores of jewelers and cops in many countries who [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3253.74s)]
*  do not find them funny at all. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3258.7799999999997s)]
*  Their exploits have become the stuff of legend, but what they did in Dubai a few years ago [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3261.58s)]
*  shocked even the police officers who'd been after them for years. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3267.14s)]
*  Security camera footage captured the scene at the upscale Wafi Mall. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3273.2999999999997s)]
*  They drove right into the mall in two outies, crashed the cars into the doors of the graphed [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3277.8399999999997s)]
*  jewelry store. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3283.58s)]
*  Then men in commando gear jumped out, ran into the shop, seemed perfectly relaxed as [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3284.58s)]
*  they broke into glass cases and bagged diamonds worth three and a half million dollars. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3290.94s)]
*  Then they got back in their cars and just drove away. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3296.94s)]
*  How did you react when you heard about the Dubai heist? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3300.58s)]
*  I mean, it was pretty brazen, wasn't it? [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3303.3399999999997s)]
*  I had to see the video of it to believe that they actually drove two cars through the mall [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3305.74s)]
*  and then do all of that in less than 45 seconds. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3313.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it was hard to believe, but it happened. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3315.8399999999997s)]
*  That's the world's chief cop who found it hard to believe. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3319.3199999999997s)]

*  I'd say that they're the most notorious organized crime group that I've been involved in investigating [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3329.9599999999996s)]
*  in my life. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3334.48s)]
*  So they're really good? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3335.48s)]
*  The problem is that they've become legendary because they are so good in their planning [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3336.56s)]
*  and their execution of robbery. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3342.28s)]
*  Legendary in part because of their name. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3344.28s)]
*  I'm sorry, darling. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3347.28s)]
*  Remember the scene from that hilarious Peter Sellers comedy where the thief hides the diamond [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3350.28s)]
*  in a jar of cold cream? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3356.28s)]
*  Well, these professional thieves did exactly the same thing after they hit a high-end jewelry [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3358.28s)]
*  store in London in 2003, making off with 40 million dollars in diamonds. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3364.88s)]
*  That's how they became known as the Pink Panthers. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3371.08s)]
*  Incidentally, it was the largest jewel heist in British history. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3374.08s)]
*  Then, Tokyo. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3379.08s)]
*  Men wearing wigs entered luxury shops, immobilized clerks with pepper spray, and made off with [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3381.2799999999997s)]
*  diamonds, a tiara, and the Contesta Von Dome necklace worth 30 million dollars. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3387.48s)]
*  Copenhagen 2007. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3394.16s)]
*  A jewelry store inside a hotel. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3396.2799999999997s)]
*  In front of stunned guests, three men raced through the lobby and into the store. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3399.2799999999997s)]
*  They smashed glass cases and made off with more than a million dollars worth of stones. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3404.48s)]
*  In the last 20 years, they've been responsible for half a billion dollars in robberies. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3410.8799999999997s)]
*  In all that time, there's been one fatality. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3416.44s)]
*  What makes the Panthers so successful, Noble says, is how they do weeks of surveillance [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3420.3599999999997s)]
*  and preparation before an attack. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3425.5s)]
*  These undercover shots show a team taking the measure of a target before a hit. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3428.3199999999997s)]
*  The M.O. of the Pink Panthers is very clear. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3434.08s)]
*  They tend to use a woman to case the jewelry stores first. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3436.2s)]
*  An attractive woman. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3440.3199999999997s)]
*  Attractive woman, woman wearing expensive clothing, woman wearing expensive jewelry. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3442.74s)]
*  A well-heeled man enters next, blocks the door open with his foot, and clears the path [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3447.04s)]
*  for the smash and grab men. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3452.3599999999997s)]
*  For people all together, precise timing and well-planned getaways are their trademark. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3454.76s)]
*  From the time they enter the door until they break all the glass in the cases, take the [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3459.6400000000003s)]
*  jewelry and are out in less than 30 seconds, and then they have a getaway plan within a [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3463.5200000000004s)]
*  matter of hours there in another country. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3467.92s)]
*  That's their classic M.O., if you will. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3470.44s)]
*  If the mafia grew out of Sicily, the Pink Panthers were a product of Montenegro and [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3473.2000000000003s)]
*  Serbia, the now independent republics in what was once Yugoslavia. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3478.48s)]
*  They were allies in the brutal Bosnian wars against the Muslims. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3483.84s)]
*  When U.N. sanctions halted the flow of products into the country, groups of soldiers became [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3488.32s)]
*  professional smugglers. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3493.92s)]
*  Did many of them have paramilitary training? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3495.7200000000003s)]
*  The corps were fighters during the war. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3499.2000000000003s)]
*  Paramilitary training, very organized, very disciplined and ruthless. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3502.7200000000003s)]
*  And those are the ones who started it back in 94, 95, 96. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3506.76s)]
*  So they learned their trade in the war. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3511.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3514.16s)]
*  They grown up with aggression. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3515.16s)]
*  They know if you want to have success in your life, you have to use force. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3517.04s)]
*  And for them it's common. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3522.88s)]
*  Andrea Schultz is a risk prevention consultant in Germany who's been investigating the gang [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3525.52s)]
*  for 10 years. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3530.7999999999997s)]
*  So the distinctive thing about Pink Panthers from robbers in other countries is that since [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3532.7599999999998s)]
*  they're so experienced in war, they are not afraid. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3537.92s)]
*  They're not afraid. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3541.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3542.84s)]
*  To date, Interpol has identified 800 corps of Pink Panthers using photos, fingerprints [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3543.84s)]
*  and DNA. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3551.08s)]
*  They are notorious for using fake passports, which makes them very hard to catch. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3552.08s)]
*  Noble says unlike the mafia, they have no chain of command. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3558.48s)]
*  They've got networks and depending upon the robbery, there's someone who organizes a particular [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3562.7200000000003s)]
*  But there is no kingpin. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3566.96s)]
*  There's no Al Capone or John Gotti. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3568.6s)]
*  I'm at the top of the organized crime groups like classic or traditional organized crime. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3571.52s)]
*  They have specialists in everything from alarms to safe cracking to stealing cars. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3576.2400000000002s)]
*  And those experts are not hard to find. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3581.76s)]
*  Do they have connections in every country? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3584.96s)]
*  In Europe, in quite every country, you have the Balkan community. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3586.9s)]
*  So they have the possibility to have connection. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3590.26s)]
*  In Switzerland, we know that. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3592.52s)]
*  And it's the same in France, in Germany, in Sweden, in Denmark. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3593.96s)]
*  Swiss detective Jan Glasse says Geneva is one of their favorite cities because it's [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3599.08s)]
*  so rich. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3604.2s)]
*  It's where billionaires come to shop and play. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3605.42s)]
*  So they went into the store? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3609.0s)]
*  They went inside this store. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3610.6s)]
*  And if they get, if they only get 15 watches, they've made like a million bucks in 50 seconds. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3612.7599999999998s)]
*  This team wearing wigs and sunglasses robbed a luxury store on the Rue de Rhone, the street [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3619.92s)]
*  in Geneva. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3625.88s)]
*  They grabbed four million dollars worth of diamonds and made their getaway in motorcycles [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3626.88s)]
*  down the street, which was too narrow for police cars. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3632.04s)]
*  So it's almost a sport between you and them, isn't it? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3635.8s)]
*  It is. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3639.12s)]
*  It is always a little bit like that. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3640.12s)]
*  That means they have, there are always a step before us because they are changing the modus [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3641.64s)]
*  And yes, it's a little bit of a cat and mouse game. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3647.08s)]
*  They're professionals. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3651.6s)]
*  They are really, really professional. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3652.6s)]
*  There's no way for you to get there in time. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3654.56s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3656.24s)]
*  For the cops, it's very difficult. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3657.24s)]
*  Normally we can say between three and four or five minutes. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3658.64s)]
*  And by that time they're in France. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3661.84s)]
*  At that time, they're on the way to France. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3663.56s)]
*  The James Bond blockbuster could be made out of what they did in Saint-Tropez. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3666.6s)]
*  The roads get clogged in summer. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3670.98s)]
*  So after posing as tourists and scoring more than three million dollars worth of jewelry, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3673.16s)]
*  the Panthers made their getaway by sea. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3678.08s)]
*  And when you hear that they got out of Saint-Tropez in speedboats, are you thinking, that's pretty [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3681.3599999999997s)]
*  good? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3687.3199999999997s)]
*  All the cops were thinking that. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3688.3199999999997s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3691.12s)]
*  But now we have a lot of job to do. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3692.12s)]
*  We drove to the seaside town of Alsine, Montenegro to meet a semi-retired Pink Panther who's [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3695.04s)]
*  been associated with that job. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3701.1s)]
*  He calls himself Philip. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3703.46s)]
*  He agreed to talk to us at a rented apartment in a secret location. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3705.34s)]
*  We had to turn off our electronic devices before he appeared and we agreed not to show [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3709.42s)]
*  his face. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3715.48s)]
*  How many, how many jobs have you done? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3717.4s)]
*  Nine. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3720.1s)]
*  Nine. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3721.1s)]
*  What was your best robbery? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3722.1s)]
*  My best robbery? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3725.1s)]
*  Okay, in France. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3727.5800000000004s)]
*  In France was my best robbery. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3730.3s)]
*  It was very, very speedy. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3732.78s)]
*  Very speedy? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3736.38s)]
*  Yeah, very speedy, like Speedy Gonzales. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3737.38s)]
*  It was good money and nobody hurts. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3740.42s)]
*  You get a couple of million euros in France and then how did you get them someplace where [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3744.98s)]
*  you could get money? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3752.7000000000003s)]
*  I have a connection everywhere. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3754.8199999999997s)]
*  If I say everywhere, I mean everywhere. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3757.8599999999997s)]
*  We go to Belgium. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3761.24s)]
*  We are friends. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3765.8199999999997s)]
*  When they go to Belgium, they always drop in on Antwerp where gems worth billions are [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3767.8199999999997s)]
*  traded every day. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3772.74s)]
*  We know that a lot of diamonds come to Antwerp, stolen diamonds, stolen jewelry. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3775.02s)]
*  Why do they come to Antwerp? [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3779.2799999999997s)]
*  Because the diamond trade is here in Antwerp. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3780.5s)]
*  Patrick Paes is chief inspector of the Antwerp Diamond Squad. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3783.14s)]
*  If you compare their volume and their value is the best product in the world, of course. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3787.94s)]
*  That's why diamonds are so much used in other criminal acts. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3796.58s)]
*  Making matters worse for cops, only the most expensive diamonds have laser inscriptions [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3801.14s)]
*  with identifying numbers. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3805.98s)]
*  And even then, large diamonds can be re-cut, making it impossible to tell whether or not [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3808.08s)]
*  they've been stolen. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3814.3199999999997s)]
*  So from what you're saying, being a diamond thief isn't a bad career. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3816.36s)]
*  You make a lot of money and the odds are with you. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3821.0s)]
*  The odds are with you that you're not going to get caught. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3823.44s)]
*  I wouldn't advise anybody to start that career, but yes, I can imagine from their view that [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3825.04s)]
*  yeah, it's a living, it's a way of living and the possibilities of getting caught are [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3831.68s)]
*  probably not that high. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3837.36s)]
*  And recently we learned the Pink Panthers have started branching out. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3839.2000000000003s)]
*  We know them as jewelry thieves. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3843.7200000000003s)]
*  Are they expanding their operations? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3846.44s)]
*  They're expanding their operations in the art and very, very fine art. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3849.96s)]
*  In 2008, a group of armed and masked Panthers hit this museum in Zurich, making off with [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3856.44s)]
*  the Monet, the Van Gogh, a Degas and a Cezanne. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3861.8s)]
*  It was the largest art robbery in European history. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3866.6s)]
*  The last of the paintings was recovered in April 2012 in a dramatic raid captured on [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3871.3199999999997s)]
*  videotape. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3877.2s)]
*  The Serbian SWAT team stormed this house to arrest the men accused of snatching the Impressionist [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3878.56s)]
*  works. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3884.56s)]
*  The cops took a van in for examination and found something hidden in the ceiling. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3885.6s)]
*  When they pulled it out, they discovered it was Cezanne's boy in the red vest. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3890.68s)]
*  Estimated value, $113 million. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3895.76s)]
*  But nailing a couple of Panthers doesn't help the police nearly as much as they would like [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3900.28s)]
*  it to. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3904.4s)]
*  Now, when one of these guys gets caught, will he squeal? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3905.4s)]
*  Will he give you evidence about the other people, his partners? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3909.2000000000003s)]
*  No, there is an omerta between them. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3912.88s)]
*  The omerta really works? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3917.32s)]
*  The omerta really works. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3918.92s)]
*  When we are speaking about the best teams, a lot of them are really friends. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3921.88s)]
*  That means they grew up together. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3925.8399999999997s)]
*  Still, since 2007, hundreds of arrests have been made. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3927.92s)]
*  But those Panthers just keep on reproducing. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3932.92s)]
*  We understand that there are approximately 180 new members in the last couple of years? [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3936.56s)]
*  Yes, so the next generation is being recruited. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3942.56s)]
*  And trained, presumably. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3946.24s)]
*  Recruited and trained. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3947.92s)]
*  Their daring has inspired legions of copycats. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3949.52s)]
*  Disguising themselves as women in burkas, these thieves robbed a jewelry store in a [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3953.12s)]
*  mall in Bahrain. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3958.08s)]
*  And this gang took to their motorcycles to rob a jewelry store in London. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3959.96s)]
*  The copycats are really just organized crime groups that have identified an easy way to [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3964.92s)]
*  make money based on the celebrity status, I would say, in large part, of the Pink Panthers. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3970.6s)]
*  And the police admit that unfortunately they themselves didn't help matters when they [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3975.8s)]
*  started calling the gang Pink Panthers. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3980.6800000000003s)]
*  The problem with this group is that the name Pink Panthers engenders inside us the first [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3984.2000000000003s)]
*  memory is the movie. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3989.5200000000004s)]
*  We smile at the name of Pink Panthers. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3995.88s)]
*  And here is why. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=3999.4s)]
*  There's your dig, bud. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=4001.4s)]
*  No? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=4003.4s)]
*  No. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=4005.4s)]
*  I thought you said your dad did not buy it. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=4009.4s)]
*  That is not my talk. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=4011.4s)]
*  And indeed the first thing you think of when you hear Pink Panthers is comedy. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=4013.4s)]
*  That's why we try to highlight whenever we can the way in which they perpetrate these [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=4019.4s)]
*  robberies. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=4024.4s)]
*  These are not nice guys. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=4025.4s)]
*  And they're not nice guys who are stealing from the rich to give to the poor. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=4026.4s)]
*  These are just cold-blooded and ruthless and notorious thieves. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgAag5g9Ig8&t=4028.4s)]
