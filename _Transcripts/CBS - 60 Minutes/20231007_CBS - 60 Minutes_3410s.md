# Billion-dollar fraud and Ponzi schemes | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [October 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE)
*  If it hadn't been for Bernie Madoff, the most famous white-collar criminal in America [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=0.0s)]
*  right now would probably be Mark Dreier. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=17.84s)]
*  If that name's not ringing a bell, it's because Dreier's $400 million Ponzi scheme [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=20.98s)]
*  was blown off the front pages by Madoff's arrest just a few days later. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=26.3s)]
*  But the case is no less fascinating. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=30.3s)]
*  The highly respected attorney who ran a big Park Avenue law firm was initially arrested [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=32.5s)]
*  in Toronto for impersonating an officer in a pension fund in what's been described as [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=37.72s)]
*  perhaps the most bizarre arrest in the history of white-collar crime. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=42.6s)]
*  But unlike Bernie Madoff, Mark Dreier agreed to talk to Vanity Fair Magazine and to 60 [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=46.82s)]
*  Minutes in his only television interview. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=51.74s)]
*  I thought if somebody would ever interview me in a program such as yours, it would be [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=55.02s)]
*  for something good I've done, not something humiliating I've done. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=58.78s)]
*  This isn't the way you wanted to be in 60 Minutes? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=63.260000000000005s)]
*  No. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=66.02000000000001s)]
*  Nor was this the way that Mark Dreier wanted to make his final appearance in federal court [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=67.02000000000001s)]
*  as a defendant in his own fraud case. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=71.5s)]
*  When we first interviewed him last spring, he was a prisoner in his own penthouse with [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=75.56s)]
*  a GPS monitoring device on his ankle detained by private jailers whose $70,000 a month fee [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=79.98s)]
*  was being paid for by Dreier's 88-year-old mother. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=86.46000000000001s)]
*  With his assets frozen or confiscated by the court, all that remained of Dreier's $40 million [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=90.86s)]
*  art collection were the hooks on the wall. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  How did you end up becoming a crook? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=98.94s)]
*  I can't remember the moment in which I decided to do something that I knew was wrong. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  I had an ambition that I needed to feed. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=108.98s)]
*  I think I fell into the trap of wanting to be more successful than I was. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=111.58s)]
*  But you were successful. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  I was, but I really wanted to distinguish myself. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=119.06s)]
*  I wanted to be as important as I thought I deserved to be. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=122.22s)]
*  With degrees from Yale and Harvard Law and the ego of a successful trial lawyer, Dreier [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=127.7s)]
*  told friends he was going to become a billionaire. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=132.86s)]
*  He started his own law firm that he said would revolutionize the business of law. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=135.9s)]
*  He was going to hire the best attorneys, pay them top dollar, and keep all the profits [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=140.5s)]
*  for himself as the firm's only partner. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  The idea for the law firm was very viable, but it needed much more money to get it off [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  the ground than I anticipated, much more. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=154.06s)]
*  So that wasn't very well thought out. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=156.84s)]
*  I had a good idea, but a very bad business plan. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=158.86s)]
*  And the plan was about to get much worse. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=161.82s)]
*  With his law firm a money pit and Dreier tapped out, he began approaching hedge funds with [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=164.32s)]
*  a cockamamie scheme he thought might save his dream. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=169.44s)]
*  Dreier told the hedge funds that he was representing a billionaire real estate developer who was [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=173.44s)]
*  looking to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars to embark on some new projects. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=178.06s)]
*  The developer, Dreier said, would issue short-term promissory notes guaranteeing interest rates [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=182.16s)]
*  of between 7 and 12 percent, well above market rates. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=187.28s)]
*  And it seemed like a very good deal. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=191.24s)]
*  The only problem was that the real estate mogul who was supposed to be borrowing all [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=193.4s)]
*  this money, Sheldon Solow, didn't know anything about it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=197.36s)]
*  Nor did he know that Dreier, his former lawyer, was fabricating financial information about [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=201.12s)]
*  his company and keeping the loan proceeds for himself. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=206.12s)]
*  So you convinced hedge funds to lend money ostensibly to Mr. Solow, your former client, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=209.88000000000002s)]
*  and in fact the money was going to you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=214.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  So you came up with phony financial statements, phony audits, forged documents for Mr. Solow's [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=218.16s)]
*  company? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=224.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=225.16s)]
*  How'd you do all that? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=226.16s)]
*  How'd you get that stuff? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=227.16s)]
*  Well, I invented it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=228.16s)]
*  You invented it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, stationery? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  From the audit firms? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  How did you get that? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  I was able to obtain their letterhead from either direct, either from correspondence [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  that I had received from them or perhaps from the internet, I don't recall. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  What was your biggest deal? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=246.32s)]
*  $100 million. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=247.88s)]
*  Somebody just gave you $100 million and never bothered to check with your supposed alleged [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=248.88s)]
*  client to make sure that this was on the up and up? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=255.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=258.24s)]
*  But I don't know, I guess I heard a long time ago too that the more money you look for, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=259.24s)]
*  the fewer questions people ask sometimes. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=264.08s)]
*  The obvious flaw in Dreier's scheme was that he would eventually have to pay off all the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=265.76s)]
*  promissory notes plus interest if he wanted to stay out of jail. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  And in the end, the only way he could do it was by selling more notes to new investors. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=274.12s)]
*  So you were digging yourself into a hole? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=279.36s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=281.48s)]
*  You know, you start with something that you think is manageable and small. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=282.48s)]
*  You know it's wrong, but you think you can fix it and you can't get out of it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  It became quicksand. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=289.44000000000005s)]
*  I had to keep meeting obligations that grew bigger and bigger. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=290.92s)]
*  Clearly, all along the way, if there was a way for me to have gotten out of it, I would [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=294.68s)]
*  have done it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  Dreier says he used most of the $400 million he stole to expand his law firm and to finance [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=299.96s)]
*  a lifestyle designed to create the illusion that he already was a billionaire. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=305.84s)]
*  There was the $11 million oceanfront compound in the Hamptons, an art collection that included [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  a Picasso, three Matisse's and 12 Warhols. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=316.55999999999995s)]
*  And then there was the 120-foot yacht Seascape with a full-time crew of 10, all mortgaged [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=320.52s)]
*  to the hilt. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=326.76s)]
*  How much did you pay for the yacht? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=327.76s)]
*  $18 million. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=330.2s)]
*  And for this apartment? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=331.2s)]
*  $10.5 million. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=332.2s)]
*  You enjoyed the good life? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=333.2s)]
*  I did. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=336.2s)]
*  It was clear to me that the more you showed people you didn't need money, the easier [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=337.2s)]
*  it was to attract money. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=340.35999999999996s)]
*  So having the trappings of success was a very important part of the plan. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=341.88s)]
*  To raise his profile, Dreier co-hosted annual charity events with former New York Giants [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  star Michael Strahan that attracted top-named performers like Diana Ross, John Bon Jovi, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=352.7s)]
*  and Alicia Keys. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=359.0s)]
*  And then there were the extravagant office parties where Dreier himself sometimes performed. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=362.24s)]
*  In this town you have to really be something. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=367.0s)]
*  You don't succeed quietly in this town, perhaps. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=370.44s)]
*  And I think I succumb to that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=372.4s)]
*  By 2007, Dreier LLP occupied 10 floors of a Park Avenue building, employed more than [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=374.96s)]
*  250 lawyers around the country with high-profile clients like Bill Cosby, Andy Pettit, Maria [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=381.56s)]
*  Sharpova, and Justin Timberlake. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=388.24s)]
*  What no one but Mark Dreier knew was that the rents, the salaries, and the expenses [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=390.72s)]
*  were all being subsidized by fraud. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=395.44s)]
*  I recognized in the last couple of years that what I saw as a $20 million mistake had grown [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=398.0s)]
*  into a mistake of a few hundred million dollars. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=407.04s)]
*  And then I did some increasingly irrational things because I wasn't thinking clearly. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=409.2s)]
*  Crazy things. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=415.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=416.16s)]
*  Desperate. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=417.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=418.32000000000005s)]
*  Last fall, as the financial crisis set in, Dreier was holding hundreds of millions of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=419.32000000000005s)]
*  dollars in loans that were about to come due. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=423.44s)]
*  And everyone wanted their money back. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  When Dreier was a month late on a $100 million loan payment, the hedge fund that was owed [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=428.18s)]
*  the money demanded a face-to-face meeting with executives at Sheldon Solow's Real Estate [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=433.08000000000004s)]
*  Operations here at his office building in New York. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=438.24s)]
*  With reality closing in, Dreier enlisted the services of a former client, Kostakovich, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=441.90000000000003s)]
*  to impersonate the president of Solow's operation. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=447.52s)]
*  Then he commandeered a conference room in Solow's office for a meeting with a hedge [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  fund in hopes of getting a loan extension. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  And you conduct this whole charade right there in the middle of Solow's business. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=457.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=462.52s)]
*  Did you think you were going to get away with that? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=463.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=467.12s)]
*  You did actually, didn't you? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=468.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=470.12s)]
*  Were you nervous? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=471.12s)]
*  I should have been nervous. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=472.28s)]
*  But I don't know, I wasn't very nervous. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=474.56s)]
*  I don't get the sense that you're a very emotional person. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=480.68s)]
*  I think I am. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=483.36s)]
*  I didn't plan anything I was going to say in this interview other than not to lose my [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=486.68s)]
*  emotions. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=492.56s)]
*  But it's not going to do me any good to literally cry over it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=494.59999999999997s)]
*  Can I ask you about the emotion? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=500.16s)]
*  Here you are, walking into a former client's office, perpetuating this scheme right in [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=502.0s)]
*  his office. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=508.3s)]
*  That's called chutzpah, that's not emotion. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=509.3s)]
*  Do I have chutzpah? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=511.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=512.9200000000001s)]
*  Can I be very tough under pressure? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=513.9200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=515.96s)]
*  So was I able to go into Mr. Solow's office and pull off that charade without falling [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=516.96s)]
*  apart? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=520.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=521.64s)]
*  Did I think I could do that? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=522.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=523.64s)]
*  Because I had done things that required nerves of steel before. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=524.64s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that I'm not emotional about what I did. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=528.16s)]
*  I clearly remember when I left that office thinking I had done something really crazy [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=531.28s)]
*  and foolish. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=536.7199999999999s)]
*  It was bizarre. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=537.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, he was impervious to the idea of being caught. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=538.7199999999999s)]
*  Attorney Gerald Shargel, who would represent Dreier during his legal proceedings and plea [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=541.8399999999999s)]
*  negotiations with the U.S. government, said the facts of the case were beyond the reach [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=546.1s)]
*  of a soundbite. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=551.02s)]
*  He was a solid lawyer and there were a number of judges who told me that Mark Dreier was [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  probably the best lawyer that's ever appeared in front of him. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=557.3000000000001s)]
*  And all of a sudden, out of the blue, it's like something went off the tracks. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=560.98s)]
*  Do you have any idea what it was? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=564.1s)]
*  You know, he was fighting his own demons. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=565.94s)]
*  In his own mind, he hadn't achieved what he was expected to achieve. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=567.86s)]
*  And he wanted to just grab for it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=574.14s)]
*  But he grabbed for it in a profoundly sick way. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=575.46s)]
*  By December of last year, both investors and investigators had grown suspicious of Dreier [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=578.5400000000001s)]
*  and his luck would eventually run out in Toronto, where he pretended to be a lawyer for a teacher's [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=583.98s)]
*  pension fund in order to swindle a hedge fund out of $33 million. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=589.38s)]
*  That was the first act I'd done where I knew I was going to get caught and just couldn't [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=594.62s)]
*  help myself. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=597.5s)]
*  I just wasn't thinking clearly. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=598.5s)]
*  Dreier had collected a business card from the lawyer he was claiming to be, but the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=601.8199999999999s)]
*  man he was supposed to meet with sensed that there was something wrong. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=606.18s)]
*  What made him suspicious, do you think? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=610.02s)]
*  He had acted diligently and he made some phone calls, which I think led him to be suspicious. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=611.9s)]
*  I knew as soon as he walked in that he was suspicious. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=616.78s)]
*  But I still did it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=619.1s)]
*  The police in Toronto were called and Dreier was arrested for impersonation. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=622.26s)]
*  When he returned to New York five days later, he was apprehended by the FBI on charges [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=626.9s)]
*  of fraud and money laundering to the complete and utter astonishment of the New York legal [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=631.62s)]
*  community and to the employees of his own law firm. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=636.5s)]
*  When we heard the news, we thought it was a joke at first. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=640.26s)]
*  There were ten floors of attorneys and boxes, but a lot of people started to resign immediately. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=644.14s)]
*  They just walked out the door. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=649.6600000000001s)]
*  Okay, next up, these are the black poltrona frown leather bucket style cheers. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=651.34s)]
*  Ten days after Dreier's arrest, the law firm bearing his name had declared bankruptcy and [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=656.26s)]
*  600 people were looking for work. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=661.02s)]
*  The day we met attorney Joanne Rapuano and longtime office manager Tory Lalonde, the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=663.86s)]
*  firm's furniture and office equipment were being sold off by the court to pay off the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=669.5s)]
*  creditors, mostly hedge funds and their investors who were not likely to see much of the missing [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=674.06s)]
*  400 million dollars. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=679.62s)]
*  Okay, now we have the paper shredder. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=680.94s)]
*  If this paper shredder could talk, how much of the paper shredder? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=684.14s)]
*  Twenty-five dollars, open it up now. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=688.14s)]
*  What's it like being here? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=689.78s)]
*  Truly tragic. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=690.9s)]
*  You know, you watch something get built, you think you're part of something on its way [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=692.62s)]
*  up, then all of a sudden you see it being carted out the front door. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=697.54s)]
*  One thousand opens it up, thousand dollar bid to open it up. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=700.5s)]
*  It's just disgraceful. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=703.54s)]
*  We are victims. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=704.62s)]
*  I have no job, I have no medical after today. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=705.62s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=707.38s)]
*  So now what do I do? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=708.38s)]
*  Start my career all over? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=709.38s)]
*  I don't want to compare you with Madoff, but one of the questions that people ask about [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=710.38s)]
*  Madoff constantly is how could he do this? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=715.54s)]
*  How could he walk around living this life, spending all this money, never showing a crack [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=717.54s)]
*  in the facade? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=722.8199999999999s)]
*  And there's some similarities. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=723.8199999999999s)]
*  How did you deal with that? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=725.6s)]
*  I was doing a lot of things at the same time. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=726.96s)]
*  I was engaged in a fraud which took a lot of energy to sustain, but I was also running [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=728.4s)]
*  a law firm, a legitimate law firm, other than obviously the obvious fact that it was funded [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=732.6s)]
*  illegitimately. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=737.52s)]
*  I was a practicing lawyer. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=738.52s)]
*  I was handling my own cases in court which took a lot of energy. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=739.76s)]
*  I almost didn't have enough time to dwell on the elephant in the room, which was the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=742.6s)]
*  very crime I was engaging with to keep all this up. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=747.96s)]
*  He has plenty of time to dwell on it now. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=752.44s)]
*  After entering his guilty plea, Mark Dreier has begun serving his 20-year prison sentence [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=755.7199999999999s)]
*  in Illinois. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=759.88s)]
*  He wanted everyone he hurt to know that he was profoundly sorry. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=762.88s)]
*  And for someone so obsessed with his own image and what people thought about him, his punishment [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=766.48s)]
*  is just beginning. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=772.0s)]
*  I've lost everything I own. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=773.0s)]
*  I've lost my business. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=776.0s)]
*  I've obviously lost my reputation. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=777.0s)]
*  I've caused my family obviously enormous unhappiness. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=779.0s)]
*  And I have nothing. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=784.64s)]
*  Do you have any friends? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=785.64s)]
*  No. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=787.64s)]
*  Uh, doesn't seem so. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=788.64s)]
*  Of all the problems facing the United States right now, none are more important than health [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=809.64s)]
*  care. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=814.4s)]
*  President Obama says rising costs are driving huge federal budget deficits that imperil [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=815.4s)]
*  our future and that there is enough waste and fraud in the system to pay for health [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=820.6s)]
*  care reform if it was eliminated. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=824.84s)]
*  At the center of both issues is Medicare, the government insurance program that provides [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=827.84s)]
*  health care to 46 million elderly and disabled Americans. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=832.52s)]
*  But it also provides a rich and steady income stream for criminals who are constantly finding [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=836.92s)]
*  new ways to steal a sizable chunk of the half a trillion dollars that are paid out each [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=842.16s)]
*  year in Medicare benefits. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=847.54s)]
*  In fact, Medicare fraud, estimated now to total about $60 billion a year, has become [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=850.14s)]
*  one of, if not the most profitable crimes in America. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=856.36s)]
*  We caution you that this story may raise your blood pressure, along with some troubling [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=860.5999999999999s)]
*  questions about our government's ability to manage a medical bureaucracy. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=864.68s)]
*  If you want to find Medicare fraud, the first place you should look is South Florida, where [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=870.0s)]
*  we were told it is pushed aside cocaine as the major criminal enterprise here. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=874.3599999999999s)]
*  It's a quiet crime, no sirens or gunfire. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=880.0s)]
*  The only victims are the American taxpayers, and they don't even know they're being [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=883.12s)]
*  ripped off. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=887.0799999999999s)]
*  FBI Special Agent Brian Waterman, who we rode with for several days, told us the only visible [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=888.0799999999999s)]
*  evidence of the crimes are the thousands of tiny clinics and pharmacies that dot the [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=894.32s)]
*  low rent strip malls. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=899.48s)]

*  No doctors, no nurses, and no patients. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=905.44s)]

*  Well, do they want you to hold? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=929.2s)]

*  We went looking for a pharmacy at 7511 Northwest 73rd Street that billed Medicare $300,000 [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=934.36s)]

*  They've already told us that there's no offices here. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=946.6s)]
*  There are no businesses here. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=949.48s)]

*  In March, the FBI arrested 53 people in Detroit, including a number of doctors, and charged [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1026.9199999999998s)]

*  We have to understand this is a major fraud area. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1052.8s)]
*  United States Attorney General Eric Holder has taken a crime that's been in the backwaters [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1056.3600000000001s)]

*  Because I think it's been pretty easy. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1067.2s)]
*  I think that they have found a way in which they've been able to get pretty substantial [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1068.72s)]
*  amounts of money with not a huge amount of effort, and at least until now, without the [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1073.1200000000001s)]

*  patients. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1126.26s)]
*  How much money did you steal from Medicare? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1127.26s)]
*  About $20 million. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1129.4599999999998s)]
*  $20 million? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1131.4599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1133.06s)]
*  Was it easy? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1134.06s)]
*  Real easy. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1135.06s)]
*  And you're not exactly a criminal mastermind? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1136.06s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1138.5s)]
*  It's more like common sense. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1140.58s)]
*  That's all you need here. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1141.58s)]
*  Did you actually ever sell any medical equipment? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1142.78s)]
*  No. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1145.46s)]
*  No. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1146.46s)]
*  Just have somebody in an office answering the phone like if we're open for business [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1147.46s)]
*  and wake up in the morning, check your bank account and see how much money you made today. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1151.58s)]
*  You didn't have any medical equipment. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1155.22s)]
*  You didn't really have any clients either, did you? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1156.58s)]
*  No. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1158.82s)]
*  All of it was fake? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1159.82s)]
*  All of it was fake, yes. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1160.82s)]
*  And you would just fill out some invoices and some forms and send them to Medicare? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1161.82s)]
*  That's it. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1166.58s)]
*  And 15 or 30 days you have a direct deposit in your bank account. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1167.58s)]
*  I mean, it was ridiculous. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1171.02s)]
*  It was more like taking candy from a baby. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1172.98s)]
*  According to the FBI, all you have to do to get into this business is rent a cheap storefront [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1175.82s)]
*  office, find or create a front man to get an occupational license, bribe a doctor or [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1180.3799999999999s)]
*  forge a prescription pad, and obtain the names and ID numbers of legitimate Medicare patients [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1185.86s)]
*  you can bill the phony charges to. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1191.3799999999999s)]
*  There's a whole industry of people out there that do nothing but provide patients. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1193.5s)]
*  When you say provide patients, what do you mean? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1197.34s)]
*  I'm just talking about lists of patients, people's names, social security numbers, addresses [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1198.9399999999998s)]
*  and date of birth. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1203.06s)]
*  With those four things, you can bill for a patient. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1204.24s)]
*  In order for Medicare to pay, you need to have a Medicare patient. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1207.1399999999999s)]
*  Where do you get those? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1210.34s)]
*  There'll be people that sell you a list of maybe $10 per patient, and I'll buy a thousand, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1211.34s)]
*  ten thousand maybe at a time. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1216.3s)]
*  And then you just fill in that patient's name and you send it. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1217.54s)]
*  And then I'll use the same patients with the same company. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1222.1399999999999s)]
*  Then the next company I use the same patients and keep using them. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1224.34s)]
*  And they'll pay for the same patient every time. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1227.34s)]
*  Once the crooked companies get hold of the patient lists, usually stolen from doctor's [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1230.24s)]
*  offices or hospitals, they begin running up all sorts of outlandish charges and submit [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1234.24s)]
*  them to Medicare for payment, knowing full well that the agency is required by law to [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1239.22s)]
*  pay the claims within 15 to 30 days, and that it only has enough auditors to check a tiny [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1244.54s)]
*  fraction of the charges to see if they're legitimate. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1250.1399999999999s)]
*  If they're not, it's usually people like 76-year-old Clara Mahoney who catch them. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1253.78s)]
*  She began to notice all sorts of crazy things turning up on her quarterly Medicare statements [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1258.6399999999999s)]
*  back in 2003, things that Medicare paid for on her behalf and that she never ordered, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1263.5s)]
*  never wanted, and never received. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1269.3799999999999s)]
*  What kind of things? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1271.36s)]
*  Oh, air mattresses, a wheelchair, a urine bag for my leg. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1272.36s)]
*  As getting so, I didn't want to open up the explanation of benefits because, you know, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1280.78s)]
*  it was like, oh no, not again. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1287.42s)]
*  Mahoney, who says she hasn't been sick in 30 years, began calling Medicare to tell them [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1289.66s)]
*  that someone was ripping them off. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1294.18s)]
*  But the only responses she received were letters saying that someone was looking into it. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1296.22s)]
*  The bogus charges are still turning up on her statements. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1300.98s)]
*  And I continued to report and I kept saying, can't you flag my account? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1304.34s)]
*  You know, I'm not getting any equipment or supplies, nothing. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1309.42s)]
*  So how many years have they been looking at it? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1313.3000000000002s)]
*  Six years. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1315.22s)]
*  Once criminals like Tony get their hands on usable patient numbers, they try and charge [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1317.14s)]
*  Medicare for the most expensive equipment possible, which requires having access to [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1321.66s)]
*  a list of Medicare codes. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1326.78s)]
*  And what were some of the best codes? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1328.8600000000001s)]
*  Artificial limbs, electric arms, electric wheelchairs. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1331.02s)]
*  I mean, a regular patient, you can put them on two artificial legs and an artificial arm [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1336.14s)]
*  and they'll pay for it. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1341.42s)]
*  And that's what happened to former federal judge Ed Davis. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1342.6200000000001s)]
*  He was one of those patients who started getting charges on his Medicare statement for artificial [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1345.38s)]

*  I looked at it and it had charges for prosthesis and I knew I had my arms. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1351.0600000000002s)]
*  Did you get the left arm and the right arm on the same bill? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1358.66s)]
*  Both arms, same bill. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1361.0600000000002s)]
*  And you obviously have two good arms. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1363.74s)]
*  The same ones that I've had for over 70 years. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1365.5s)]
*  Didn't anybody at Medicare check to see if any of these charges were valid? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1368.86s)]
*  Sometimes they'll do, but by the time they did it, it was too late. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1373.66s)]
*  Too late? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1376.86s)]
*  Yeah, we already made three, four hundred, five hundred thousand on it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1377.86s)]
*  And then we will never send them nothing back. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1380.62s)]
*  And then in 30 days, they'll send an inspector to your office and by that time, it's all [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1382.86s)]
*  closed down. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1387.1s)]
*  It's all closed down. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1388.1s)]
*  So they would pay first and audit later? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1389.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1391.5s)]
*  There's something I don't understand. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1392.5s)]
*  You're saying essentially people just fill out the phony paperwork. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1395.38s)]
*  They send the bill to Medicare and they pay it. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1399.54s)]
*  That's why you have companies that can run for 60 to 90 days and bill for ridiculous [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1402.6200000000001s)]
*  things because there are very few checks and balances to even determine whether these things [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1407.02s)]
*  A were medically necessary, B were ever given, or C even physically possible for a patient [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1412.42s)]
*  with the kind of conditions they have. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1418.6200000000001s)]
*  The FBI calls it pay and chase and riding around with them, we saw plenty of examples. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1420.9s)]
*  This tiny pharmacy in Ahayalee, a strip mall, went from billing Medicare $13,000 in May [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1426.6200000000001s)]
*  to billing nearly a million dollars a month later. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1433.18s)]
*  This place billed $800,000 in the month of June? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1435.9s)]
*  Correct. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1439.8200000000002s)]
*  That's a pretty small place. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1440.8200000000002s)]
*  By the time we were there in August, the FBI says the owners had already burned the company, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1442.0800000000002s)]
*  shut it down and moved on to another operation. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1446.98s)]
*  We were here last week. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1449.82s)]
*  There was stuff on the shelves. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1451.82s)]
*  The business still had a name on it. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1453.22s)]
*  You can still see from where the tape is that someone just took this off. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1454.82s)]
*  To understand just how preposterous all of this is, the FBI says that this tiny little [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1457.98s)]
*  store collected six times more money from Medicare in June than the largest Walgreens [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1462.98s)]
*  pharmacy in the state of Florida. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1468.58s)]
*  Quite an achievement since neither the FBI nor the proprietor of the bingo parlor next [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1471.02s)]
*  door ever saw a customer coming or going. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1475.86s)]
*  What's the deal with the pharmacy? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1479.02s)]
*  I've never seen people only twice. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1480.02s)]
*  No customers? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1482.86s)]
*  No customers. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1483.86s)]
*  It's always been locked. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1484.86s)]
*  We obviously had a few questions to ask of the people at Medicare and requested an interview [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1486.9s)]
*  with the person in charge of preventing fraud. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1491.78s)]
*  That turned out to be Kim Brandt, Medicare's director of program integrity. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1494.7s)]
*  We went around with an FBI agent and a woman from Health and Human Services. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1499.18s)]
*  They took us to storefront after storefront after storefront, billing three or four hundred [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1502.94s)]
*  thousand dollars a month. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1508.9s)]
*  And they were completely empty. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1511.66s)]
*  Nobody there. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1513.22s)]
*  And how do they get away with that? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1514.22s)]
*  We're as frustrated by that as the law enforcement officials that you went out with. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1515.46s)]
*  And in fact, our primary focus over the past two years has been to tighten our enrollment [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1519.06s)]
*  standards to make it so it's much harder for people like that to be able to get in the [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1523.22s)]
*  program and to be able to commit that kind of fraud. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1527.06s)]
*  Look, I'm sure that you're aware of these problems, but it doesn't seem like you're [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1529.5800000000002s)]
*  doing a very good job. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1534.26s)]
*  I don't mean you personally, but I mean the government. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1535.26s)]
*  This is still like a huge problem and getting worse. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1537.18s)]
*  Well, it really does come down to the size and scope of the Medicare program and the [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1540.5800000000002s)]
*  resources that are dedicated to oversight and anti-fraud work. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1545.8600000000001s)]
*  One of our biggest challenges has been that we have a program that pays out over a billion [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1549.6200000000001s)]
*  claims a year, over $430 billion, and our oversight budget has been extremely limited. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1553.7s)]
*  About that, there is little dispute. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1561.02s)]
*  Medicare has just three field inspectors in all of South Florida to check up on thousands [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1563.26s)]
*  of questionable medical equipment companies. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1567.78s)]
*  Clearly, more auditing needs to be done, and it needs to be done in real time. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1570.06s)]
*  Why has it taken Medicare so long to figure out they were being scammed? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1573.82s)]
*  I think lack of resources, probably. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1578.22s)]
*  Then I think people I don't think necessarily thought that something as well-intentioned [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1583.02s)]
*  as Medicare and Medicaid would necessarily attract fraudsters. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1588.6599999999999s)]
*  But I think we have to understand that it certainly has. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1594.06s)]
*  The Obama administration is providing Medicare with an additional $200 million to fight fraud [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1596.9399999999998s)]
*  as part of its stimulus package, and billions of dollars to computerize medical records [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1602.58s)]
*  and upgrade networks should help Medicare catch more phony charges. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1607.26s)]
*  Tony, who has just begun serving his 12-year prison sentence, says there's no shortage [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1612.02s)]
*  of people in Miami waiting to take his place. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1616.9s)]
*  How many people in Miami were doing this? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1620.14s)]
*  I'd say at least 2,000 people. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1621.8200000000002s)]
*  At least 2,000, 3,000 companies. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1625.3s)]
*  Well presumably some of them are going to be legitimate. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1627.06s)]
*  I'd say less than 5%. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1629.66s)]
*  Less than 5%? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1632.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1633.14s)]
*  If I went to the phone books and looked under medical equipment suppliers, 95% of the companies [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1634.14s)]
*  would be phony? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1638.14s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1639.14s)]
*  There's no greater desperation than to be told that you or your child has a disease [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1641.94s)]
*  for which there is no hope. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1655.7s)]
*  Many people with incurable illness look forward to the promise of stem cells. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1658.26s)]
*  Stem cells have the potential to turn into any kind of cell, and in theory, they could [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1663.42s)]
*  repair damaged cells. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1668.22s)]
*  Scientists tell us that we're years away from realizing that dream. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1670.3400000000001s)]
*  There's no stem cell miracle today, so con men have moved in to offer the hope that science [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1674.94s)]
*  cannot. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1681.3000000000002s)]
*  Just look online and you will find hundreds of credible-looking websites offering stem [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1682.5800000000002s)]
*  cell cures in overseas clinics. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1687.7s)]
*  Two years ago, we began investigating stem cell charlatans. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1690.9s)]
*  We worked with patients suffering from incurable diseases, and we discovered con men posing [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1694.82s)]
*  as doctors, conducting dangerous medical experiments. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1700.58s)]
*  You know, Mr. Stowe, the trouble is that you're a con man. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1704.62s)]
*  Our report started a federal investigation. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1709.3s)]
*  Since that story, we've been digging into the rapidly growing trade in fake stem cell [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1713.1399999999999s)]
*  cures, and we've found something even more alarming. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1718.34s)]
*  Illegal stem cell transplants that are dangerous and delivered to your doorstep. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1721.98s)]
*  They're scams that often bilk the desperate out of their last dollar of savings and their [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1727.6200000000001s)]

*  Adam and Brandon Susser are 11-year-old twins. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1737.74s)]
*  Adam has cerebral palsy. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1741.14s)]
*  His brain was damaged by a lack of oxygen before he and his brother were born. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1742.9s)]
*  He's confined to a wheelchair. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1748.38s)]
*  He needs assistance with all his daily living activities, from cleanliness to feeding to [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1750.26s)]
*  clothing. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1755.7s)]
*  Gary and Judy Susser have searched for anything that might improve on the judgment handed [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1756.86s)]
*  down by Adam's doctors. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1762.18s)]
*  The sentence of being a quadriplegic, the sentence of being totally blind, the pronouncement [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1764.3799999999999s)]
*  by physicians that we should put him away. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1771.18s)]
*  Those were the things that his regular doctors were telling you. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1773.86s)]
*  Correct. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1776.7s)]
*  Being advised, literally, put him away. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1777.7s)]
*  He's going to destroy your life. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1780.3400000000001s)]
*  So back in 2003, the Sussers took a chance on the theory of stem cells. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1782.06s)]
*  Adam was three. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1787.54s)]
*  They brought him to a doctor in Mexico who injected stem cells with no idea whether they [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1788.8600000000001s)]
*  would work. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1794.42s)]
*  We both decided that in the severity of his condition that we'd have to try it. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1795.42s)]
*  Apparently there was no harm and no miracle. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1803.7s)]
*  The progress that he made after that was minimal at best and therefore we didn't see any good [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1807.46s)]
*  coming out of it. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1814.5s)]
*  Today, people like the Sussers can find hundreds of sophisticated websites offering stem cell [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1816.0600000000002s)]

*  To help us learn the truth about the illicit stem cell industry, the Sussers agreed to [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1843.14s)]
*  work with us in an investigation of one stem cell laboratory. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1848.06s)]
*  We focused on StemTech Labs of Ecuador because it offers cures for cerebral palsy and a long [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1852.5s)]
*  list of 70 incurable diseases. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1859.5s)]
*  The website claims a modern day medical miracle and says, we are FDA registered, apparent [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1863.26s)]
*  approval from the Food and Drug Administration. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1870.18s)]
*  The founder and director of StemTech Labs is an Alabama doctor named Dan Eklund. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1873.94s)]
*  We've been tracking Dr. Eklund for months. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1879.3799999999999s)]
*  Hello, is Dan Eklund there please? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1882.62s)]
*  In October, we asked the Sussers to contact Dr. Eklund. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1885.74s)]
*  Eklund sent them a letter which offered the blind and paralyzed atom the possibility of [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1889.66s)]
*  an improved level of consciousness, improved ability to see, to speak, to stand, and walk. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1895.18s)]
*  What can stem cells really do today? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1903.42s)]
*  We asked a scientist who's doing some of the world's most advanced studies in stem cells, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1906.22s)]
*  Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1910.5s)]
*  I believe stem cells have a lot of promise, but we are way at the infancy because real [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1912.5s)]
*  stem cells are very difficult to control as therapy. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1918.74s)]
*  I personally think we're 10 years away from seeing real cell therapies that are working [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1923.3400000000001s)]
*  and are safe, but I do believe it will come. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1929.0600000000002s)]
*  Dr. Kurtzberg is a physician and the chief scientific officer of a stem cell research [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1932.26s)]
*  program at Duke University. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1937.9s)]

*  laboratory which works with stem cells harvested from umbilical cord blood. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1945.1s)]
*  Dr. Kurtzberg told us there is no evidence yet that stem cells can treat cerebral palsy. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1950.26s)]
*  Some of the diseases that we see stem cell cures offered for on the internet include [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1957.4199999999998s)]
*  multiple sclerosis. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1964.9399999999998s)]
*  There are no stem cell cures yet for multiple sclerosis. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1966.5s)]
*  Lou Gehrig's disease? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1969.9399999999998s)]
*  I wish there were, but there are not. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1971.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, I wonder how often it happens that you have to tell a patient, I'm sorry, there's [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1973.3s)]
*  nothing we can do. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1977.02s)]
*  And then they come back to you two days later and say, well, I see all these cures on the [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1978.82s)]
*  internet. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1983.58s)]
*  I get many of those calls and emails and see many of those patients, but it's very dishonest [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1984.5s)]
*  to mislead people when there's nothing you can do. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1990.34s)]
*  But there's a lot that can be done for Adam Susser at least according to Dr. Eklund who [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1994.22s)]
*  spoke to the Sussers from his lab in Ecuador. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=1999.74s)]
*  Dr. Dan, Adam. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2003.1s)]
*  Hello, Adam. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2005.6999999999998s)]
*  Can you see him, Doc? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2007.4599999999998s)]
*  Dr. Eklund's only examination of Adam came by teleconference. Eklund didn't know. We [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2008.6599999999999s)]
*  were watching. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2014.6599999999999s)]
*  You think it would help him, you know, make him improve? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2015.62s)]
*  I think it's likely to help him, yes. I would say 75% chance that he would have a noticeable [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2019.6599999999999s)]
*  improvement. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2029.78s)]
*  Eklund proposed four treatments costing a total of $20,000. The Sussers asked Eklund [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2031.14s)]
*  to treat Adam near their Florida home. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2036.8600000000001s)]
*  Again, my concern would be the legalities of it. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2039.7800000000002s)]
*  He's right to be concerned it would be a felony to use stem cells in an unapproved therapy [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2043.98s)]
*  or to sell them for export to the U.S. That's why we were surprised to see this on many [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2049.62s)]
*  websites. A shopping cart. We clicked on Eklund's StemTech Labs cart and with no medical or scientific [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2056.94s)]
*  credentials we bought 20 million umbilical cord stem cells for $5,000 shipped to America. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2065.7799999999997s)]
*  We had the cells sent by the highest medical standard. Duke University suggested we use [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2076.02s)]
*  something called a dry shipper cooled with liquid nitrogen. We sent the dry shipper to [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2081.38s)]
*  StemTech. StemTech sent the frozen cells to us and we forwarded them to Joanne Kurtzberg. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2086.6200000000003s)]
*  A computer chip inside our package verified that the cells were properly frozen all the [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2093.2200000000003s)]
*  way. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2099.5s)]
*  Dr. Kurtzberg analyzed the cells. For comparison, look under the microscope. Healthy umbilical [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2100.3s)]
*  cord stem cells look like this. The cells we got from StemTech had disintegrated. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2107.7000000000003s)]
*  So these are the cells you purchased and they are dying or dead. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2115.0600000000004s)]
*  We see all of these dead and disintegrating cells and essentially cellular debris. Are [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2119.6200000000003s)]
*  there dangers of injecting that into someone? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2127.3s)]
*  There are huge dangers if you injected that into someone's blood or spinal fluid because [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2129.98s)]
*  all these little fragments and debris would get trapped somewhere in the bloodstream and [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2135.14s)]
*  could cause a stroke or in the brain could cause an inflammatory reaction. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2140.58s)]
*  This could actually do harm? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2145.06s)]
*  Yes, this could do a great deal of harm. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2146.2599999999998s)]
*  Remember the Sussers asked Dr. Eklund to treat Adam in the U.S. and last month he got out [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2149.7799999999997s)]
*  of a van to meet Gary Susser at a Florida hotel where Eklund planned to do the transplant. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2156.06s)]
*  We dug into Dr. Eklund's background and we found things that he hadn't told the Sussers. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2163.18s)]
*  This is the document in which the state of Alabama revoked his medical license in 2005. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2168.94s)]
*  The state medical commission said Dr. Eklund admitted that he prescribed controlled substances [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2175.7799999999997s)]
*  to a patient with whom he was having sex, prescribed controlled substances to a patient [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2181.7s)]
*  who he knew was a drug addict and had sexual experiences with young female children. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2187.3399999999997s)]
*  We also tracked down his laboratory in Ecuador, not exactly the state of the art facility [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2195.18s)]
*  claimed in his website. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2201.8799999999997s)]
*  The hotel room Gary Susser and Dan Eklund headed for was set up with a number of cameras [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2204.3399999999997s)]
*  that were tucked out of sight. Susser excused himself. Eklund was expecting to meet Judy [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2209.54s)]
*  and Adam, the blind and paralyzed 11 year old in whom he intended to transplant stem [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2216.1s)]
*  cells, cells from his lab that sold us the dangerous biomedical junk. Instead we came [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2221.7799999999997s)]
*  in. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2229.46s)]
*  Dr. Eklund, I'm Scott Pelley with 60 Minutes. How are you today? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2230.06s)]
*  I am... iced. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2237.46s)]
*  You've been working with the Sussers on a story and I want you to know that we're being [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2242.22s)]
*  recorded. And I wanted to ask you about the treatment that you propose for Adam. What [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2245.8599999999997s)]
*  would that be? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2251.66s)]
*  The treatment that he asked about was for stem cells, human stem cells. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2254.1s)]
*  And you think they're applicable for cerebral palsy? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2260.4199999999996s)]
*  Yes. I have seen them be effective in cases of cerebral palsy. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2263.18s)]
*  How does that work exactly? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2269.3s)]
*  Well stem cells contain... excuse me here. No one knows exactly. But stem cells do contain [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2274.38s)]
*  and give off chemicals which cause other cells to repair themselves. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2290.02s)]
*  In the letter that you sent the Sussers, you described possible effects for Adam which [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2295.5s)]
*  could include improved ability to see, improved ability to speak, improved ability to move [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2301.78s)]
*  arms and legs. You believe those things are possible? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2309.7s)]
*  I do. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2313.66s)]
*  What is your training in stem cells? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2315.66s)]
*  My training in stem cells was I studied for about six years going over the literature. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2319.3s)]
*  Then I started producing stem cells in my lab. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2326.78s)]
*  You're self-educated, self-taught. Have you published any research? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2330.3s)]
*  No. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2336.5s)]
*  Frankly Dr. Eklund, you have nothing to base your results on. There's no clinical trial, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2337.86s)]
*  there's no blind study, there are no medical papers published. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2343.1400000000003s)]
*  That doesn't make any difference. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2347.94s)]
*  You know you say it doesn't make any difference that you haven't done these studies. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2350.7000000000003s)]
*  The studies have been done in other countries. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2354.02s)]
*  I would imagine it would make a big difference to the Sussers. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2355.98s)]
*  The studies have been done in other countries. These are not published in the United States [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2359.38s)]
*  because they cannot be published in the United States. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2363.9s)]
*  Where is this seen in the medical literature anywhere in the world? If you did the things [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2367.3s)]
*  that you describe in this paper, you would win the Nobel Prize. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2372.3s)]
*  No, if I did the things that are described in that paper, it would not be published. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2376.6600000000003s)]
*  It would be suppressed and you wouldn't hear about it. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2380.1400000000003s)]
*  Eklund told us breakthroughs with stem cells aren't published in scientific journals because [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2385.1400000000003s)]
*  of a conspiracy of drug companies and governments that he had trouble defining. That's when [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2389.76s)]
*  we told him we bought cells from his lab. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2395.5600000000004s)]
*  When your cells are delivered, they're functioning, living stem cells. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2399.6600000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2405.02s)]
*  We purchased some stem cells from StemTech Labs six months or so ago and had them delivered [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2407.02s)]
*  to Duke University, which did tests on the stem cells and they determined that the stem [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2414.8199999999997s)]
*  cells were dead. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2421.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, they must not have handled them appropriately then. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2422.8199999999997s)]
*  You're thinking that you handled them appropriately but the stem cell laboratories at Duke University [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2427.8199999999997s)]
*  did not. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2433.38s)]
*  That would be my assumption, yeah. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2434.38s)]
*  I don't think that there's any chance they were damaged in treatment. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2436.38s)]
*  We asked Dr. Kurtzberg to listen to Eklund's theories. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2441.38s)]
*  Yes, I have seen them be effective in cases of cerebral palsy. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2445.38s)]
*  This is pretty scary, actually, that he would be saying these things, that he would be leading [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2450.38s)]
*  them on this way because what he's talking about is very dangerous. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2457.38s)]
*  Is this a con, Dr. Eklund? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2460.38s)]
*  No, it's not a con. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2462.7400000000002s)]
*  I have taken the stem cells myself. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2467.7400000000002s)]
*  Would I take the stem cells if I thought that they were a con? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2470.7400000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2474.7400000000002s)]
*  Putting them in an 11-year-old boy is an entirely different matter. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2477.7400000000002s)]
*  That's why I took care to explain the remotest possible difficulties which have never been reported. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2483.1s)]
*  Without any medical studies that have been published in major journals that have suggested [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2494.1s)]
*  that stem cells have any efficacy. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2501.1s)]
*  You keep going back to this point, that they are not published in major medical journals. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2504.1s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2510.1s)]
*  It is the standard of the world. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2511.46s)]
*  I do keep going to that point. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2512.46s)]
*  I'm telling you that they are not going to be published in this country because when [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2514.46s)]
*  someone does try to do it, then they have 60 minutes to come and visit them. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2518.46s)]
*  And I think that's enough for me. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2523.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2525.46s)]
*  We don't know where Dan Eklund went, but we do know the whereabouts of the two conmen [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2531.46s)]
*  who were the subjects of our first stem cell story two years ago. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2536.46s)]
*  In that investigation, we worked with patients Stephen Waters and Michael Martin, who suffered [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2541.46s)]
*  with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2546.7799999999997s)]
*  They were promised miracles from Lawrence Stowe and Frank Morales, who offered a $125,000 [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2550.2599999999998s)]
*  stem cell therapy. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2558.86s)]
*  Will it keep me out of a wheelchair? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2559.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2561.86s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2562.86s)]
*  Our story launched a federal investigation, and last week, Morales and Stowe were indicted. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2563.86s)]
*  The indictment alleges they made $1.5 million with stem cell fraud. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2571.82s)]
*  If convicted, they could face 20 years in prison. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2576.82s)]
*  The patients who helped us, Stephen Waters and Michael Martin, lost their lives to ALS [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2580.68s)]
*  last spring. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2586.16s)]
*  We will continue our reporting on the stem cell fraud tomorrow on our brand new morning [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2587.68s)]
*  broadcast, CBS This Morning. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2592.86s)]
*  This is a special report. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2631.36s)]
*  It's especially pertinent given the financial disasters of the past few years. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2632.36s)]
*  So, it's time for a short and painless test. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2635.36s)]
*  Are you sometimes just too trusting? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2639.56s)]
*  Do you invest in things you don't really understand? [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2642.08s)]
*  Are you also a bit greedy? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2645.04s)]
*  Then you too could be suffering from pigeon fever. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2647.4s)]
*  Pigeons just so you know are what conmen call their victims. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2651.04s)]
*  After a year of revelations about Bernard Madoff, who cheated investors out of billions, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2655.08s)]
*  you might think Americans have wised up. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2660.5s)]
*  That chance. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2663.46s)]
*  Prosecutors and regulators tell us that even in this age of skepticism, Ponzi schemes like [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2665.42s)]
*  Madoff's are thriving. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2670.82s)]
*  One regulator even calls it Ponzimonium. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2672.86s)]
*  Why are there so many pigeons around? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2676.74s)]
*  We asked a few people who should know. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2679.92s)]
*  As a student of con games and deception, were you at all surprised by the Bernie Madoff [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2683.74s)]
*  scam? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2688.98s)]
*  Would you be surprised if I told you that I predicted it? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2690.14s)]
*  For starters, we approached Ricky Jay, America's foremost card sharp, actor, sleight of hand [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2692.94s)]
*  artist, a man with an encyclopedic knowledge of con men, past and present. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2699.02s)]
*  He told us of a talk he gave seven years before Madoff's fall. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2705.06s)]
*  Beware of someone well established in the industry. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2710.34s)]
*  A lecture on financial fraud to a gathering of police officers in 2001. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2713.1s)]
*  I would also beware of someone who will rely heavily on an affiliation with an investor [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2719.14s)]
*  group, be it religious, ethnic or geographic. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2723.9s)]
*  He was describing Madoff to a T. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2727.7s)]
*  I think these elements will make the market ripe for any sort of pyramid or Ponzi scam [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2730.58s)]
*  Ricky Jay. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2735.2599999999998s)]
*  And that is pure Bernard Madoff. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2736.2599999999998s)]
*  It's pure Bernie Madoff. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2738.9s)]
*  But can I tell you another element of the con? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2740.74s)]
*  I actually made this page on Photoshop last night and put it into this bulletin. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2744.18s)]
*  I did that to prove a point. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2750.02s)]
*  The point is, you set it up by saying that I was a student of cons and that I'm knowledgeable [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2751.94s)]
*  in that area. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2758.46s)]
*  And so you allowed my supposed expertise to make you believe this is true. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2759.7799999999997s)]
*  This magazine is true. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2765.06s)]
*  I really have lectured to this group of police against confidence crime. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2766.5s)]
*  Everything is true except for this page, which I slipped in last night. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2771.18s)]
*  So what's the moral? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2774.66s)]
*  Trust no one. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2777.18s)]
*  We wouldn't want to live in a world where we couldn't be conned because in effect we [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2778.2799999999997s)]
*  would then be living in a world where we mistrusted or refuse to trust anyone. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2782.54s)]
*  So this is the price we pay. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2788.72s)]
*  And pay we have. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2791.2999999999997s)]
*  In the wake of the Madoff scandal, Ponzi perp walks have become a marathon. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2792.8199999999997s)]
*  Texas financier Allen Stanford, accused of a $7 billion Ponzi scheme. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2797.86s)]
*  Minnesota businessman Tom Petters, convicted recently of a $3 billion scam. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2804.1400000000003s)]
*  And Park Avenue lawyer Mark Dreier, mastermind of a mere $400 million Ponzi scheme that landed [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2811.1200000000003s)]
*  him first on 60 Minutes and then in federal prison. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2818.86s)]
*  I thought if somebody would ever interview me in a program such as yours, it would be [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2823.54s)]
*  for something good I've done, not something humiliating I've done. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2827.3s)]
*  Despite the downfall of the Dreiers and the Madoffs, Ponzi operators, large and small, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2832.18s)]
*  are busier than ever, knowing we're all capable of greed, misplaced trust and something else. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2837.9s)]
*  I think it's anxiety. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2844.9s)]
*  It's anxiety that you're losing out, that other people are doing better than you are. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2847.1s)]
*  Stephen Greenspan is a University of Colorado professor who writes and lectures on gullibility, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2851.38s)]
*  warning audiences that not reading the fine print or buying something on a tip from your [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2857.98s)]
*  brother-in-law are bad ideas, and that older people are particularly vulnerable to a friendly [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2862.94s)]
*  pitch from a con man. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2869.94s)]
*  In most of the great moments of gullibility in history, the perpetrator seems to target [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2872.44s)]
*  a particular group, correct? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2879.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2881.38s)]
*  There have been Ponzi schemes targeting Mormons or fundamentalist Christians. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2882.38s)]
*  Madoff mostly was aimed at Jews because he was a prominent Jewish philanthropist. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2887.38s)]
*  So yes, there is this affiliation aspect though because we tend to trust our own kind. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2892.6600000000003s)]
*  Here in 1919 is Charles Ponzi, self-styled financial wizard, loafing at his Boston mansion [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2897.3s)]
*  with his lovely wife and proud and adoring mother. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2903.78s)]
*  Mr. Ponzi himself promised fellow Italian immigrants he could make them rich trading [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2907.14s)]
*  in postal reply coupons, sort of the prepaid phone cards of the day. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2912.42s)]
*  Ponzi went to prison and died a pauper. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2918.62s)]
*  I went out looking for trouble. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2921.3s)]
*  I found it. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2923.22s)]
*  But his name lives on for the fraud he made famous. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2924.78s)]
*  The basic concept is robbing Peter to pay Paul. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2928.46s)]
*  You have a fund of new money coming in and you use the new money to pay the old investors, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2931.56s)]
*  but at a certain point that has to stop. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2936.94s)]
*  Gullibility is at the very core of this, correct? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2939.2200000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2943.14s)]
*  I mean, history is filled with examples. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2944.14s)]
*  Mr. Jay's library is replete with documents about cons, scams and hoaxes of all kinds. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2946.46s)]
*  Amazing animals. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2953.5s)]
*  And the sinosophilus was often featured on circus lots and eventually people realized [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2954.5s)]
*  that the sinosophilus was a baboon wearing lateros. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2960.02s)]
*  Celebrated con men, including Count Victor Lustig. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2964.1s)]
*  This is an original wanted poster of the Count. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2968.22s)]
*  One of the things he did in France was he was able to sell the Eiffel Tower for scrap [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2971.46s)]
*  metal and he was able to do it twice, which is sort of wonderful. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2975.54s)]
*  Mr. Jay reports that over the years people really have tried to sell the Brooklyn Bridge [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2979.86s)]
*  as well as Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square in London. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2985.7799999999997s)]
*  And in another cautionary tale, still unfolding, pigeons were both the investors and the investment. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2989.9s)]
*  Arlen Galbraith, who called himself the Pigeon King, convinced hundreds of American and Canadian [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=2998.46s)]
*  farmers there was good money to be made raising the birds for food. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3004.12s)]
*  And everybody we talked to said this guy was, he was on the up and up. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3009.6600000000003s)]
*  Nobody had a bad word to say about him anywhere that we could find. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3013.5s)]
*  So Aaron and Jolene Humbert, Ohio farmers, signed up. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3016.78s)]
*  They've had such tremendous demand for the live birds. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3021.1800000000003s)]
*  The Pigeon King assured investors that pigeons would replace chickens in every pot in America [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3024.6600000000003s)]

*  He'd sell you breeding stock and buy back the offspring. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3032.34s)]
*  Soon barns across the Midwest and Canada were filled to the rafters with birds and high hopes. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3035.98s)]
*  He was building his herd, building the flock. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3043.46s)]
*  He had to have so many hundreds of thousands of birds a week to supply his production. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3046.58s)]
*  But to some, including the Attorney General of Iowa, it sounded like a Ponzi scheme. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3052.34s)]
*  Iowa and three other states barred the Pigeon King from doing business. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3057.54s)]
*  And shortly after the Humberts bought in, Pigeon King International declared bankruptcy. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3062.7s)]
*  The Humberts lost $300,000, most of it borrowed money. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3068.5s)]
*  We've contacted everybody in the states we could think of, and you know, from elected officials [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3073.86s)]
*  to FBI to our local prosecutor. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3078.82s)]
*  And everybody says, yeah, obviously there's something wrong here. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3082.5800000000004s)]
*  It was a scam, but to prove it is going to be very difficult. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3085.46s)]
*  Galbraith declined our request for an interview. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3089.06s)]
*  Canadian police now say he was running a Ponzi scheme. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3092.06s)]
*  Do you blame yourselves at all? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3096.42s)]
*  To a point, we just didn't find the red flags popping up. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3099.1400000000003s)]
*  So we tried it and then we lost. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3103.18s)]
*  A lot. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3107.58s)]
*  Michael went to Vegas and put it all on red. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3108.58s)]
*  We would have had a lot more fun. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3111.58s)]
*  At least in Vegas, you know, the odds always favor the house. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3114.7799999999997s)]
*  Elsewhere, even the most sophisticated among us can be had. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3118.9s)]
*  For instance, our gullibility expert, Stephen Greenspan, who, after writing a book on the [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3123.1s)]
*  subject, discovered he'd lost $400,000 of his retirement money to who else? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3128.9s)]
*  Bernie Madoff. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3136.6600000000003s)]
*  Was it embarrassing for you? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3138.02s)]
*  Two days after I had the first book copy in my hand, I found that, well, it was painful, obviously. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3140.34s)]
*  And the fact was, Greenspan had never even heard of Madoff. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3146.86s)]
*  The hedge fund managing his retirement money had simply reinvested the $400,000 with Madoff. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3150.86s)]
*  I don't even think I read the prospectus. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3157.9s)]
*  I trusted the people I was turning my money over to, and I've always done that, and it's [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3161.06s)]
*  usually worked well. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3164.46s)]
*  Except in this one case. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3166.06s)]
*  What did your wife say to you when you confessed that you'd lost part of your nest egg? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3167.9s)]
*  I told you so. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3174.9s)]
*  Because I had tried to suck her into it. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3175.9s)]
*  And she said, I don't think so. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3178.7400000000002s)]
*  What made her suspicious? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3180.9s)]
*  Maybe it was the word hedge fund. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3182.5s)]
*  Which brings us to Wall Street and the financial meltdown of 2008. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3184.38s)]
*  Poking through the wreckage, many experts believe the root cause was a perfect storm. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3189.42s)]
*  A monsoon of gullibility colliding with a tidal wave of greed. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3195.6200000000003s)]
*  This was a massive Ponzi scheme, and it's the biggest crime against the American economy [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3201.1400000000003s)]
*  in our lifetimes. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3206.02s)]
*  In fact, ever. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3207.02s)]
*  Jenna Tavakoli is an analyst specializing in derivatives, the exotic financial instruments [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3208.7s)]
*  at the heart of the meltdown. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3215.02s)]
*  She argues that the bad mortgage loans that fueled the crisis were repackaged by investment [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3217.2999999999997s)]
*  banks, sliced into increasingly complex derivatives, and resold to other investors, even though [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3222.94s)]
*  the underlying mortgages were often virtually worthless. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3229.8599999999997s)]
*  You had various traders buying each other's products to artificially keep the prices up [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3234.58s)]
*  so that the bubble didn't collapse. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3242.02s)]
*  Not only that, but the mortgage derivatives being traded were so mind-numbingly complicated, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3245.06s)]
*  nobody understood them fully. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3251.46s)]
*  Certainly not the pigeons, the buyers at banks, mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3253.98s)]
*  companies who wound up holding a bag full of worthless paper. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3260.26s)]
*  These guys are smart guys. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3264.78s)]
*  They're all graduates of the finest business schools in the country, correct? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3266.1000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3269.86s)]
*  If they were gullible, they're sophisticated investors. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3270.86s)]
*  So they can't really go back to the investment banks that sold them this product and said, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3273.6600000000003s)]
*  we've been had, because they held themselves out to be experts in these kinds of securities. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3279.5800000000004s)]
*  All of which proves that whether you're on Wall Street or Main Street, brain power is [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3285.34s)]
*  no defense against con men. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3290.6600000000003s)]
*  In fact, smart guys may be the biggest suckers of all. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3293.1000000000004s)]
*  As someone who does sleight of hand for a living, to me the ideal audience would be [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3297.42s)]
*  scientists or Nobel Prize winners who are incredibly smart in their one area and often, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3301.6200000000003s)]
*  often, not always, have an ego with them which says, I am really smart, so I can't be fooled. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3307.5s)]
*  No one is easier to fool. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3313.66s)]
*  So Morley, I'm going to play you one hand of blackjack with certain propositions that [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3315.58s)]
*  make it too good to be true. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3319.8199999999997s)]
*  And so determined not to be conned by him again, I sat down for a friendly card game [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3321.54s)]
*  with Mr. J. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3326.7799999999997s)]
*  You win all toys. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3327.94s)]
*  The rules were all stacked in my favor. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3330.46s)]
*  I got 20, he showed a nine, meaning I thought it was impossible for him to win. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3333.02s)]
*  God, the only thing that could beat you would be if I had a 12 or something. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3340.1s)]
*  Which I do. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3344.7799999999997s)]
*  You see, I have the 12 of clubs. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3345.7799999999997s)]
*  So I have 21 to your 20. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3349.2599999999998s)]
*  But there's no such thing as a 12 of clubs, right? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3351.66s)]
*  Wrong. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3355.66s)]
*  Not only did Mr. J. manipulate the cards somehow to get the ones he wanted, he was also dealing [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3356.66s)]
*  from a deck used in certain rummy games that includes 11s, 12s and 13s. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3362.8399999999997s)]
*  This pigeon had been had again. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3369.94s)]
*  And the other real element of the con is that I told you this was too good to be true. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3372.94s)]
*  Anyone should stand clear of something that's too good to be true. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3378.5s)]
*  Because it never is. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3382.58s)]
*  It never is. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM06mYPSYpE&t=3383.58s)]
