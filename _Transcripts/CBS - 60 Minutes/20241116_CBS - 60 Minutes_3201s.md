# Remarkable Kids | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [November 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s)
*  For many high school students returning to class this month, it may seem like geometry [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=0.0s)]
*  and trigonometry were created by the Greeks as a form of torture. So imagine our amazement [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=16.96s)]
*  when we heard two high school seniors had proved a mathematical puzzle that was thought [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  to be impossible for 2,000 years. We met Kelsie Johnson and Nekia Jackson at their all-girls [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=28.56s)]
*  Catholic high school in New Orleans. And as we first reported this past spring, we expected [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=35.96s)]
*  to find two mathematical prodigies. Instead, we found at St. Mary's Academy, all students [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=41.84s)]
*  are told their possibilities are boundless. Come Mardi Gras season, New Orleans is alive [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=48.68s)]
*  with colorful parades replete with floats and beads and high school marching bands. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  In a city where uniqueness is celebrated, St. Mary's stands out with young African-American [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=67.64s)]
*  women playing trombones and tubas, twirling batons and dancing, doing it all, which defines [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=75.32s)]
*  St. Mary's, students told us. Junior Christina Blasio says the school instills in them they [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=81.63999999999999s)]
*  have the ability to accomplish anything. That is kind of a standard here. So we aim very high. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=88.6s)]
*  Like every, our aim is excellence for all students. The private Catholic elementary and high school [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=94.72s)]
*  sits behind the Sisters of the Holy Family Convent in New Orleans East. The Academy was [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=100.96s)]
*  started by an African-American nun for young Black women just after the Civil War. The convent [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=106.88s)]
*  still supports the school with the help of alumni. In December 2022, seniors Nekia Jackson and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=113.55999999999999s)]
*  Kelsie Johnson were working on a school-wide math contest that came with a cash prize. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=120.83999999999999s)]
*  I was motivated because there was a monetary incentive because I was like $500 is a lot of money. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=127.68s)]
*  So I would like to at least try. Both were staring down the thorny bonus question. So [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=133.6s)]
*  tell me what was this bonus question? It was to create a new proof of the Pythagorean Theorem. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=140.56s)]
*  And it kind of gave you a few guidelines on how would you start a proof. The seniors were [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  familiar with the Pythagorean Theorem, a fundamental principle of geometry. You may remember it from [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  high school. A squared plus B squared equals C squared. In plain English, when you know the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=159.6s)]
*  length of two sides of a right triangle, you can figure out the length of the third. Both had studied [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=166.0s)]
*  geometry and some trigonometry and both told us math was not easy. What no one told them was there'd [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=172.16s)]
*  been more than 300 documented proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem using algebra and geometry. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=180.24s)]
*  But for 2,000 years, a proof using trigonometry was thought to be impossible. And that was the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=186.88s)]
*  bonus question facing them. When you looked at the question, did you think, boy, this is hard? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. What motivated you to say, well, I'm going to try this? I think I was like, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  I started something. I need to finish it. So you just kept on going? Yeah. For two months that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=207.92s)]
*  winter, they spent almost all their free time working on the proof. She was like, Mom, this is [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=214.0s)]
*  a little bit too much. CeCe and Cal Johnson are Calce's parents. So then I started looking at what [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=220.64s)]
*  she really was doing. And it was pages and pages and pages of like over 20 or 30 pages for this one [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=226.96s)]
*  problem. Yeah. The garbage can was full of papers where she would work out the problems. And [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=234.24s)]
*  if that didn't work, she would ball it up, throw it in the trash. Did you look at the problem? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  Nellisca Jackson is Nakaiya's mother. Personally, I did not because most of the time I don't [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=245.44s)]
*  understand what she's doing. What if we did this? What if I write this? Does this help? A x squared. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  Their math teacher, Michelle Blue and Williams, initiated the math contest. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=258.0s)]
*  And did you think anyone would solve it? Well, I wasn't necessarily looking for a [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=262.8s)]
*  solve. So no idea. What were you looking for? I was just looking for some ingenuity, you know. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=267.2s)]
*  Calce and Nakaiya delivered on that. They tried to explain their groundbreaking work to 60 Minutes. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  Calce's proof is appropriately titled The Waffle Cone. So to start the proof, we start with just a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=280.0s)]
*  regular right triangle where the angle in the corner is 90 degrees and the two angles are alpha [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=286.16s)]
*  and beta. So then what we do next is we draw a second congruent, which means they're equal in [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=292.08s)]
*  size. But then we start creating similar but smaller right triangles going in a pattern like [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  this. And then it continues for infinity. And eventually it creates this larger waffle cone [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=306.88s)]
*  shape. Am I going a little too? You've been beyond me since the beginning. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh, good. So how did you figure out the proof? Okay, so we have a right triangle, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=316.0s)]
*  90 degree angle, alpha and beta. Then what did you do? Okay, I have a right triangle inside of the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=322.88s)]
*  circle. And I have a perpendicular bisector at OP to divide the triangle to make that small right [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=330.0s)]
*  triangle. And that's basically what I use for the proof. That's the proof. That's what I call [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=339.76s)]
*  amazing. Well, thank you. There had been one other documented proof of the theorem using trigonometry [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=346.48s)]
*  by mathematician Jason Zimba in 2009, one in 2000 years. Now it seems Nakaiya and Calce have joined [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=353.12s)]
*  perhaps the most exclusive club in mathematics. So you both independently came up with proof [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=362.0s)]
*  that only use trigonometry? Yes. So are you math geniuses? I think that's a stretch. If not genius, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=371.28s)]
*  you're really smart at math. Not at all. To document Calce and Nakaiya's work, math teachers [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=380.88s)]
*  at St. Mary's submitted their proofs to an American Mathematical Society conference in [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=389.04s)]
*  Atlanta in March 2023. Well, our teacher approached us and was like, hey, you might be able to actually [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=394.32s)]
*  present this. I was like, are you joking? But she wasn't. So we went, I got up there, we presented [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=400.16s)]
*  and it went well, and it blew up. It blew up. Yeah. What was the blow up like? Insane, unexpected, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=407.36s)]
*  crazy, honestly. Today's story features two high school students, Calce Johnson and Nakaiya Jackson. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=418.24s)]
*  It took millennia to prove, but just a minute for word of their accomplishment to go around the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=425.44s)]
*  world. They got a write-up in South Korea and a shout out from former first lady Michelle Obama, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=431.12s)]
*  a commendation from the governor and keys to the city of New Orleans. Why do you think so many [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=437.92s)]
*  people found what you did to be so impressive? Probably because we're African-American, one, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=443.92s)]
*  and also women. So I think, oh, and our age, of course, our age is probably played a big part. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=449.6s)]
*  So you think people were surprised that young African-American women could do such a thing? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=455.76s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. I'd like it to actually be celebrated for what it is. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=461.12s)]
*  Like, it's a great mathematical achievement. Achievement. That's a word you hear often around [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=464.88s)]
*  St. Mary's Academy. Calce and Nakaiya follow a long line of barrier-breaking graduates. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=470.88s)]
*  The late queen of Creole cooking, Leah Chase, was an alum. So was the first African-American female [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=478.48s)]
*  New Orleans police chief, Michelle Woodfork, and judge for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=485.28s)]
*  Dana Douglas. Math teacher Michelle Bluen-Williams told us Calce and Nakaiya are typical St. Mary's [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  students. They're not unicorns. Oh, no. If they are unicorns, then every single lady that has [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=499.36s)]
*  matriculated through this school is a beautiful black unicorn. Pamela Rogers, St. Mary's president [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=506.0s)]
*  and interim principal, told us the students hear that message from the moment they walk in the door. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  We believe all students can succeed. All students can learn. It does not matter the environment that [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=521.2s)]
*  you live in. So when word went out that two of your students had solved this almost impossible [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=527.76s)]
*  math problem, were they universally applauded? In this community, they were greatly applauded. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=536.0s)]
*  Across the country, there were many naysayers. What were they saying? They were saying, oh, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=542.56s)]
*  they could not have done it. African-Americans don't have the brains to do it. Of course, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=547.28s)]
*  we sheltered our girls from that, but we absolutely did not expect it to come in the volume that it [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=552.08s)]
*  came. And after such a wonderful achievement? People have a vision of who can be successful. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=559.28s)]
*  To some people, it is not always an African-American female, and to us, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=572.64s)]
*  it's always an African-American female. What we know is when teachers lay out some expectations [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=579.28s)]
*  that say, you can do this, kids will work as hard as they can to do it. Gloria Ladson Billings, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=585.8399999999999s)]
*  professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin, has studied how best to teach [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=595.36s)]
*  African-American students. She told us an encouraging teacher can change a life. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=600.64s)]
*  And what's the difference, say, between having a teacher like that and a whole school [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=606.72s)]
*  dedicated to the excellence of these students? So a whole school is almost like being in heaven. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=614.48s)]
*  What do you mean by that? Many of our young people have their ceilings lowered, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=621.5200000000001s)]
*  that somewhere around fourth or fifth grade, their thoughts are, I'm not going to be anything [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=628.48s)]
*  special. What I think is probably happening at St. Mary's is young women come in as perhaps [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=635.6800000000001s)]
*  ninth graders and are told, here's what we expect to happen, and here's how we're going to help you [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=642.24s)]
*  get there. At St. Mary's, half the students get scholarships subsidized by fundraising [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=646.88s)]
*  to defray the $8,000 a year tuition. Here, there's no test to get in, but expectations are high [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=654.16s)]
*  and rules are strict. No cell phones, modest skirts, hair must be its natural color. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=662.8s)]
*  Students Raya Siddique, Summer Ford, Carissa Washington, Tatum Williams, and Christina Blasio [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=669.76s)]
*  told us they appreciate the rules and rigor. Especially the standards that they set for us, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=677.12s)]
*  they're very high and I don't think that's ever going to change. So is there a heart of philosophy [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=683.04s)]
*  and essence to St. Mary's? The sisterhood. The sisterhood. Yes. And you don't mean the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=688.4s)]
*  nuns, you mean you. So when you're here, there's just no question that you're going to go on to [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=695.52s)]
*  college. College is all they talk about. And Arizona State University. Principal Rogers announces to [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=703.36s)]
*  her 615 students the colleges where every senior has been accepted. So for 17 years, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=711.36s)]
*  you've had a 100% graduation rate and a 100% college acceptance rate. That's correct. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=718.72s)]
*  Last year, when Nikaia and Kelsey graduated, all their classmates went to college and got scholarships. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=728.72s)]
*  Nikaia got a full ride to the pharmacy school at Xavier University in New Orleans. Kelsey, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=735.68s)]

*  So wait a minute, neither one of you is going to pursue a career in math? No, no. I may take up a [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=747.92s)]
*  minor in math, but I don't want that to be my job job. Yeah, people might expect too much out of me [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=754.0799999999999s)]
*  if I'm a mathematician. But math is not completely in their rear view mirrors. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=761.9200000000001s)]
*  This spring, they submitted their high school proofs for final peer review and publication [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=767.9200000000001s)]
*  and are still working on further proofs of the Pythagorean theorem. Since their first two, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=773.9200000000001s)]
*  we found five and then we found a general format that could potentially produce at least five [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=780.0s)]
*  additional proofs. And you're not math geniuses? No, no. I'm not buying it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=785.12s)]
*  In the world of skiing, there are two kinds of skiers. Those who like to stay on groomed runs [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=797.92s)]
*  and be guided gently around obstacles, and those who like to ski the whole mountain and ski towards [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=803.28s)]
*  the obstacles. That is called freeriding. Man-made jumps, rails, and half pipes are rejected [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=808.88s)]
*  in favor of the drops, jagged cliffs, and deep chutes created by Mother Nature. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=816.16s)]
*  The sport of freeriding took off in the 1990s and is now one of the fastest growing disciplines in [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=821.92s)]
*  skiing. Given the risks inherent with the terrain, it attracts some of the bravest and most adventurous [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=827.68s)]
*  skiers in the world. But as we first reported last March, even among that group, 15-year-old [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=833.92s)]
*  Jacob Smith stands out. We thought you should see what he does because he cannot. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=840.4s)]
*  This is Big Sky, Montana, home to some of the steepest and most challenging ski slopes in the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=849.1999999999999s)]
*  country. And that is Jacob Smith, who is blind. Three years ago, he was just 12 years old as he [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=855.52s)]
*  made his way to the top of the 11,000-foot high Lone Peak to ski down it. Watch this. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  Dropping in three, two, one. Jacob drops into the big couloir, a narrow rock-walled [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=871.6s)]
*  1,400-foot chute. That dot is him making his way turn by turn. A wrong move can be catastrophic. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=878.72s)]
*  The run has a 50-degree slope, which means if you slip down the couloir, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=888.32s)]
*  there's little chance you can stop yourself. When you're standing at the top, you feel like if you [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=893.2800000000001s)]
*  move, you're going to die. And that's the moment most people would say, you know what, maybe not [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=898.24s)]
*  a good idea. Yeah, but I'm kind of just like, well, I'm already up here, so I've got to make [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=902.1600000000001s)]
*  it down somehow. He did and became the only legally blind athlete to ski the legendary run. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=905.7600000000001s)]
*  You did it. That was awesome. History just has been made. Forever. How'd you feel when you made [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=914.32s)]
*  it to the bottom? Excited that I did it. I didn't crash. I thought it was awesome. Well, I guess we [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=921.2800000000001s)]
*  made it four more times, so I just wanted to do it again. You were testing your luck that day. Yeah. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=926.72s)]
*  We got Jacob Smith on course. Jacob is still testing his luck and good sense. We met him [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=931.6800000000001s)]
*  in January at a junior regional freeride tournament in Big Sky. That's him, now 15 years old, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=937.84s)]
*  competing against 40 other teenage daredevils, all of whom can see perfectly well. Coming right [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=945.2800000000001s)]
*  off the top of that. Finding pretty good landing. This time, the background for all the competitors' [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=951.76s)]
*  spectacular experiment with gravity was another triple diamond shoot, appropriately named DTM. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=958.8000000000001s)]
*  DTM stands for? Don't Tell Mama. It is an insane run, like a 45-degree slope. Yeah. Do the judges [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=967.2s)]
*  give you any slack for being blind? No, zero. Do you think they should? No, I don't. I want to be [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=976.8s)]
*  treated normal so I compete with other sighted skiers. It's not an insignificant difference. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=983.44s)]
*  We worked with his doctors and our graphic artists to show roughly what Jacob can see on a run. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=990.72s)]
*  He has extreme tunnel vision and no depth perception on top of that. It's blurry. His [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=996.96s)]
*  visual acuity is rated 2,800, four times the level of legal blindness. Think of the big E on the eye [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1002.88s)]
*  chart. He would need it to be blown up four times in order to see it from 20 feet away. Fantastic ski [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1010.64s)]
*  technique. You wouldn't be able to tell he's visually impaired. So how does Jacob ski like this? His [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1018.24s)]
*  family keeps him on course. Go up with your right feet really far. On competition days, his little [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1024.88s)]
*  brother Preston patiently helps him hike to the top of the venue. It's so high the lifts won't [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1030.5600000000002s)]
*  take you there. First down, down, perfect, perfect, keep going. Then his father Nathan helps him get [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1037.2s)]
*  down. Nice turns, nice turns. Jacob has a two-way radio turned up high in his pocket. His dad is on [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1044.0800000000002s)]
*  the other end at the base somehow calmly guiding him down. Okay right, right, right. It's on me to [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1052.88s)]
*  make sure I don't let him down that I get him in trouble. You know that I have to guide him through [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1060.72s)]
*  narrower chutes or not go off a cliff. You have to be his eyes. Yeah. And there can't be a delay. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1065.3600000000001s)]
*  He can't say you're sure dad. No. Have you ever missed it? Have you ever said oh gosh I forgot [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1072.24s)]
*  to tell him about that or I didn't see that? Oh yeah all the time but his adaptation is pretty [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1076.5600000000002s)]
*  amazing. How much do you trust him? Well I mean enough to turn right when he tells you. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1081.76s)]
*  Jacob's just putting his all into my dad's voice. It's crazy skiing just listening to someone turn [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1087.6s)]
*  there, turn there. Could you ski like that? It's like closing your eyes basically. It would be so [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1093.92s)]
*  hard. Jacob's siblings are all competitive skiers. That's Andrew who's 17 doing a 360. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1099.2s)]
*  Preston is 14 and Julia is 12. Do the other competitors know that he's blind? Some do but [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1107.04s)]
*  they always like announce it over the intercom that like blind skier Jacob coming down the hill. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1114.48s)]
*  He is the only ever I have to say blind skier. That's when everyone turns and looks. Oh it's a [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1120.72s)]
*  miracle. Look at him. Would you know if you didn't know? He's such a good skier for legally blind. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1127.28s)]
*  They just get mad at him if he's in the way. If we tell anybody that he's legally blind [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1133.5200000000002s)]
*  then nobody believes us. They just give us a bad look. Jacob was born with vision. Soon after he [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1138.4s)]
*  learned to walk he was on skis. Family vacations were spent bombing down the trails in big sky [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1145.2s)]
*  with his family but it was back home at their ranch in North Dakota that an unexpected obstacle [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1151.1200000000001s)]
*  changed Jacob's life. He started getting headaches and began bumping into things. He was eight years [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1158.48s)]
*  old. I like ran into a wall or something that my mom saw and then it was like two days after I went [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1164.5600000000002s)]
*  to the eye doctor and I took one look at my eyes looked at my mom and then just asked like which [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1170.0s)]
*  hospital you want because my octave nerve was swelling and bleeding. Did you have any sense [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1178.8000000000002s)]
*  that things were going wrong up until that point? No. That day Jacob was flown here to the Masonic [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1183.84s)]
*  Children's Hospital in Minneapolis where he underwent an emergency 12-hour surgery after an MRI [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1191.4399999999998s)]
*  revealed a cancerous brain tumor the size of a softball that was crushing his optic nerve. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1199.1999999999998s)]
*  It's the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life. It looked like half his brain was a tumor. So at [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1205.84s)]
*  that point you're not thinking I'm worried he's going to lose his vision. You're thinking I'm [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1211.52s)]
*  raising a child. You're gonna lose your child. I'm gonna bury a kid. In that first surgery doctors [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1214.8799999999999s)]
*  removed enough of the tumor to relieve the pressure on Jacob's optic nerve to stop his [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1221.84s)]
*  vision from continuing to deteriorate. Here he is leaving a message for his siblings a few days later. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1227.04s)]
*  I miss you all a lot. I really, really do. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1233.2s)]
*  It's getting my vision is getting better. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1241.04s)]
*  I'm coming home and I'm really excited. But Jacob would need three more major brain surgeries [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1248.0s)]
*  over the next three years all before he was 12 years old. My head feels okay. Each time with an [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1255.44s)]
*  extensive rehabilitation. Did you ever get down about it? Like I did but at the same time I just [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1262.88s)]
*  prayed a lot. When you were praying about it were you praying this will be over? Were you praying [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1273.1200000000001s)]
*  I want to get my vision back? Or were you praying I'll stay alive? That I'll stay alive and that'll [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1278.3200000000002s)]
*  get through it and that's what happened. Finally in 2017 a course of radiation eradicated the cancer [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1283.68s)]
*  and Jacob got a clean scan. But his doctor said the radiation increased his lifetime risk [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1291.68s)]
*  of another brain tumor by up to 30 percent. Right now the tumor that we originally targeted [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1298.64s)]
*  is gone. You know so far so good. It doesn't sound like you've exhaled. I don't think you ever exhale. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1306.8s)]
*  Because? Because there's always the what if. You know when you get put into that situation that you [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1315.2s)]
*  never felt you ever should have been or expected. I don't think you're ever going to exhale and go [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1321.12s)]
*  we're done. Whose idea was it to return to skiing? Well my dad's. Turn and go straight through it. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1326.32s)]
*  So we came out here and we kind of just tried it out. Everywhere I went skiing for probably the [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1334.1599999999999s)]
*  first year or two was with either my dad or a coach. You've taught your kids to ski but you've [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1339.84s)]
*  never taught a blind child to ski? No. So you did not know what you were doing? No. So tell me [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1345.76s)]
*  about those early days. Well at first everyone said get a rope and a sign and he's gonna be a blind [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1351.04s)]
*  skier and you're gonna guide him. Like I'm like nope that's not an option we're not gonna do it that [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1356.1599999999999s)]
*  way. Because why? Because I'm not gonna let that define him. Father and son admit they're trying [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1360.08s)]
*  to carve their own path. Sort of figuring it out as they go. Jacob says he's learned to listen for [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1367.68s)]
*  danger, other skiers, the churning of a lift or icy conditions under foot. Andy says he remembers [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1374.64s)]
*  many of the runs from when he could see. Can you feel your way down a run you didn't go on before [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1383.76s)]
*  you lost your vision? I mean yeah I can and I've done it. And how does it work out? It's pretty [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1389.68s)]
*  scary and sometimes takes me a little minute. That's gotta be terrifying. You get used to it. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1397.44s)]
*  How many crashes were there in those early days? I don't even think I didn't count that high. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1406.3200000000002s)]
*  When Jacob was 10 he shattered his femur in 60 places when he skied into a tree. Are you not [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1412.24s)]
*  nervous that there's gonna be a catastrophic accident that he could die doing this? It's not [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1419.3600000000001s)]
*  the way I like vision life. I don't look for the reasons not to do things. I'm not gonna put him [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1425.28s)]
*  in something that I'm not going through first. That the consequences of falling are not going [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1430.24s)]
*  to be life-threatening. What are you fearful of? The only big fear I have is not succeeding. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1436.08s)]
*  You're more afraid of not succeeding than you are of getting hurt. Yes. Why is that? Because [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1443.84s)]
*  I've already lost my vision so a couple broken bones and a couple more mishaps I guess isn't a [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1451.1200000000001s)]
*  big deal to me at all. Clearly he's fearless. As a parent are you not fearful? He's not reckless. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1457.44s)]
*  He knows his limitations. I think he has the ability to ski anything on the mountain but he's [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1466.3200000000002s)]
*  not going to go try to do it by himself. Like he wants to be with somebody he wants to trust. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1472.48s)]
*  He won't ski with people he doesn't trust. Nathan said Jacob is cautious about skiing [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1476.8s)]
*  and competing on low visibility days when he can see even less than usual. Still he finds a way [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1482.3999999999999s)]
*  of keeping up with his siblings. They are an enviable pack on the mountain. Do you see him [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1489.28s)]
*  being like super plugged into everything else right to the sounds? He was saying he like hears [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1495.76s)]
*  the lift, the snow. Yeah. What do you see? His hearing is very like he chooses what he wants to [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1500.56s)]
*  hear so. What do you mean? There's times at home where he'll be like you could say his name a [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1506.1599999999999s)]
*  thousand times and he'll pretend like he didn't hear one word but then skiing it's like you could [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1512.56s)]
*  like flick and he'll like just turn you know. On competition day Jacob suits up and sends it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1518.32s)]
*  Dad drop in three two one. Finishing 19th out of 41 competitors. For Jacob success isn't about [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1525.6799999999998s)]
*  the trophy it's about freedom. Showing others how to negotiate obstacles even when you can't see [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1535.6s)]
*  them coming. Coming to the finish line. There you go. Honestly no matter what gets thrown in front [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1542.6399999999999s)]
*  of you what kind of comes out of nowhere and strikes you takes you off guard a little bit. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1548.3999999999999s)]
*  There is always a way to conquer it to adapt to make it happen and still do what you want to do. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1553.92s)]
*  You can't wave a wand and make intolerance hardship and violence disappear but you can [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1571.76s)]
*  use magic to try. We learned that after visiting a remarkable school in Cape Town South Africa. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1577.04s)]
*  It's called the College of Magic. While it's not an accredited institution it is a real life [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1583.04s)]
*  Hogwarts. A school filled with students ranging in age from 10 to 18 and more importantly reflecting [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1588.6399999999999s)]
*  South Africa. They come from privilege and poverty. Pick a canard any canard sleight of hand juggling [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1594.8s)]
*  ventriloquism card tricks you can learn it all at the College of Magic. But as we first reported two [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1601.04s)]
*  years ago what the school really teaches is also the great superpower of magic itself. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1606.48s)]
*  Rethinking the limits of possibility. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1612.3200000000002s)]
*  It looks like any other campus. Gothic architecture, a diverse student body, a core curriculum. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1621.2s)]
*  All balanced with electives. To become masters of magic these kids must be both tacticians [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1631.44s)]
*  and technicians. Up down a kiss and pull down one at a time. Like any art form this one requires [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1639.2s)]
*  practice, application, discipline. Six spades. There is no magic bullet. While students attend [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1646.4s)]
*  academic school during the week they come here after school on weekends and on holidays. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1657.2s)]
*  It takes six years to earn a diploma. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1662.8s)]
*  Sinatemba Bawuti is a teacher, a graduate and himself now a practicing magician. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1671.2s)]
*  He shows students the tricks of the trade. What is it about magic? What appeals to you so much [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1676.6399999999999s)]
*  about this? I didn't think that I would be doing this as a career or performing it like doing it [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1682.72s)]
*  to support myself. I want to put a smile on people's faces, make them happy, entertain them, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1688.96s)]
*  break eyes. That's what I wanted to do. But then it became my thing that I'm using to feed my [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1693.3600000000001s)]
*  family and myself. And he says he and the school aim to teach the kids honesty, humility and respect. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1697.92s)]
*  Sounds like the tricks and the juggling is only a small part of it. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1706.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's not a college of magic, it's a college of life. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1711.1200000000001s)]
*  For the revered dean and founder David Gore, it's been 40 years since he stopped practicing [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1716.64s)]
*  law and pulled the ultimate bit of misdirection. In his hometown of Cape Town he opened a college, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1721.44s)]
*  the only school of its kind devoted to wonder. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1728.72s)]
*  I'm surely not the first person to make the joke. You gave up law to pursue a career of [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1734.0s)]
*  deception. I like to think of it as deception. We like to think of it as [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1738.88s)]
*  of illusion and wonderment. This is giving some of the game away. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1742.3200000000002s)]
*  Gore's encyclopedic knowledge and love of magic fills the halls, quite literally. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1745.6000000000001s)]
*  Contraptions and memorabilia trace the history of illusion. Even with all the sophistication [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1750.8000000000002s)]
*  around us, there's nothing more exciting than seeing a magician alive and seeing something [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1756.0s)]
*  appear or disappear right under your nose. Well, what do you attribute that to? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1761.0400000000002s)]
*  I think people genuinely are very interested in and curious about how the laws of nature can be [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1764.48s)]
*  suspended. And I think the magician offers that opportunity, that gateway to a world which we all [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1772.4s)]
*  would love to be part of, where gravity is always pulling us to planet Earth where we can float [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1778.96s)]
*  upwards. It's a beautiful feeling. Nothing here is quite as it seems. On our visit here in July [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1784.0s)]
*  2022, students were preparing for the annual Children's Magic Festival. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1789.84s)]
*  We have a dress rehearsal. What do you think? Turban or notes? I like the turban. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1793.9199999999998s)]
*  Whoa. Turn up your card, please. Turn it up? Yes. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1810.08s)]
*  Very good. That was a winner. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1813.68s)]
*  Coming to our close-up theater. Come inside. Michael Barta has been teaching here for decades. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1821.92s)]
*  I teach children how to use their hands. And this, this, I do. Okay, I was juggling three [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1828.0800000000002s)]
*  balls. Somebody's taken my ball. The school was always conceived to go beyond hocus pocus. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1835.2s)]
*  Is magic about what you see or what you miss? Barta thinks it's both. So how many balls do I [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1841.76s)]
*  have? Magic develops skepticism and curiosity. Those two things are needed in education. But [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1847.8400000000001s)]
*  that's great. You come here, there's a healthy skepticism. How did he do that? Yeah. And it's [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1855.2s)]
*  mixed with this curiosity, this wonder. How did he do that? I know. How did he do that? Wow. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1859.52s)]
*  From the school's beginning, it reflected a cross-section of South Africa. Now, as then, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1866.3200000000002s)]
*  students come from the most wealthy suburbs and from Cape Town's most impoverished townships. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1871.4399999999998s)]
*  Duma Mccorkie's day starts at dawn in the tin shack he shares with his grandmother and aunt. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1877.6799999999998s)]
*  Duma's mother was murdered four years ago. The sprawling shanty town, like so many others in [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1884.1599999999999s)]
*  the country, is pocked by violence and drugs. Some of them are carrying guns and some of them [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1890.6399999999999s)]
*  are carrying knives, like busy robbing old people, like being on drugs and stuff. So like, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1896.48s)]
*  I have to be in those because, hey, gunshots. You're describing gunshots and knives and drugs [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1903.44s)]
*  and gangs. And you come here, it must be a bit of a relief. It helped me a lot. Like, it saved me [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1913.2s)]
*  from doing those stuff because I became an artist and like I became to take care of myself. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1920.88s)]
*  You say artist. Yeah, you're a magician and you're an artist because it's art. Yeah. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1930.16s)]
*  In the townships, you don't come across many bow ties, so when Duma passes by, he draws attention. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1937.68s)]
*  A quick bit of whiz. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1947.3600000000001s)]
*  And gee whiz. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1950.88s)]
*  And he's off. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1961.92s)]
*  The school arranges transportation when needed, shuttling the kids on the long journey into the [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1965.1200000000001s)]
*  city. There is no uniform as such, but students are encouraged to dress as smartly as they can. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1970.3200000000002s)]
*  For many, going to the school marks a rare opportunity to get out of the township. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1977.92s)]
*  Tuition is $350 a year, unaffordable for most of the 130 students. The college, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1986.48s)]
*  a nonprofit, raises funds for scholarships, breakfast and lunch included. You have some [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1993.76s)]
*  kids coming here who are malnourished. You have to feed. You have other kids getting [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=1999.1200000000001s)]
*  picked up by parents in fancy sports cars. Is that hard for you to watch? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2004.08s)]
*  Yes, I think it's an important part of our nation building and for understanding that young people [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2008.08s)]
*  get to understand how each other is living and how we think and how we approach life. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2014.0s)]
*  These are going to be the young people who are going to drive this nation forward. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2020.0s)]
*  I can see some people watching this saying this college of magic is all well and good and you're [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2024.6399999999999s)]
*  teaching kids to make coins disappear, but why aren't you teaching them coding or something [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2028.64s)]
*  more practical? I think the most important skill in the 21st century is going to be [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2033.1200000000001s)]
*  imaginative thinking because no matter which career you select to go into, it's going to [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2039.1200000000001s)]
*  no longer be your knowledge around that because that knowledge is so freely available now on the [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2044.88s)]
*  internet. It's going to be how you use that knowledge and there is no better topic or subject [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2049.36s)]
*  than magic to explode the whole idea of imagination. They trade their cape for a three-piece suit or [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2054.16s)]
*  for a sports jersey or for a nurse's attire. You're okay with that? Absolutely. 15-year-old [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2061.6s)]
*  Nakane Ntame is a rising star at the college, but four years ago she had to beg her mother [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2068.24s)]
*  to allow her to enroll. And then I was like, mom, I would like to join this. What are you talking [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2074.0s)]
*  about? I want to become a magician. And she thought I was crazy, but here I am today. Here you are. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2079.52s)]
*  Your mom said you were crazy for wanting to be a magician. Because they do not believe in magic. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2086.96s)]
*  Not only that, for many in the townships, magic is associated with the occult or witchcraft. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2094.08s)]
*  The first time I performed, I performed for my grandmother, right? So she does not understand [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2100.0s)]
*  magic at all. And every time she would see magic, like, which means darkness, you know, evil powers [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2105.84s)]
*  and stuff like that. People are saying, I don't understand. Explain it to me. What do you tell them? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2112.08s)]
*  Oh, that magic is not black magic. We do not practice any kinds of spells, dark spells. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2116.96s)]
*  There are actually secrets behind the magic and it takes time to practice and master it. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2123.92s)]
*  This effect you must follow very, very carefully because a lot of things happen. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2130.88s)]
*  Milo Dreher-Smith says his mom had to convince him to enroll. Before I came to College of Magic, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2135.28s)]
*  I was very shy. So I couldn't dance even in front of my brother and sister. I would just kind of go [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2140.96s)]
*  high behind my mom. And my mom said I need to learn SI skills. SI is social intelligence. Yes. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2147.2000000000003s)]
*  And then when we learned about the College of Magic, she was like, that is the perfect spot. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2153.28s)]
*  Firstly, you'll get into a good high school because you have lots of different talents. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2157.28s)]
*  And secondly, it's SI skills. I'm going to go out on a limb here. I'm going to take a risk. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2160.5600000000004s)]
*  You came here for more social intelligence to come out of your shell a little bit. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2165.6000000000004s)]
*  It seems like it's working. Yeah, it is working. Being a magician, do you feel like you're part of [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2169.2000000000003s)]
*  a secret society, a secret club? Yes. Like a secret agent of a big force. Let's do a roleplay. Milo, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2174.4s)]
*  Milo, tell me how you do that trick. No. Why not? Because you're a dunderhead and you wouldn't be [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2182.32s)]
*  able to understand. I'm a dunderhead. Yes, you are. Never give up your secrets though, right? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2190.32s)]
*  Actually, all my family has learned all of it by now because when I practice for a performance, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2195.84s)]
*  they pick up my mistakes. Your family can keep a secret? I'm not sure about my sister. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2202.56s)]
*  Ten miles and an incalculable distance from where Milo lives, meet Lulo Stofile, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2210.32s)]
*  Lulo the Great as he calls himself. He lives in a one-bedroom home with his father, Sean, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2217.04s)]
*  mother, Belinda and little sister, Lolu. He too transformed after joining the College of Magic. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2223.52s)]
*  Was he always that way? No, he was too shy like his sister. This guy was shy? Very, very shy. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2233.12s)]
*  I don't believe it. Very, very shy. But for Belinda and Sean, magic is more than a tool to [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2241.2s)]
*  get Lulo out of his shell. It might also be his path out of poverty. Bravo. I said to Lulo, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2246.56s)]
*  each and every day, continue with your magic. Continue with your magic. Yes. Fly wherever you [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2252.96s)]
*  want to go to. It's your life, it's not my life. But the only thing that I want from you [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2260.56s)]
*  is to succeed in life. That's it. One day you're going to be a famous magician. Is that what you [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2265.44s)]
*  want? Yes, any 12 will help me. Three Lulo. But first things first, tomorrow is the Children's [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2275.04s)]
*  Magic Festival and Lulo can barely contain himself. What's the goal tomorrow? The goal [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2281.84s)]
*  tomorrow is to show people who I am, I'm Lulo the Great, the Jagler, spinning rings, all that stuff. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2288.08s)]
*  Cards, juggle, dancing. What doesn't Lulo the Great do? Lulo the Great doesn't do only one thing, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2295.44s)]
*  many stuff. A man of many talents. Many talents. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2304.0s)]
*  There was an abundance of talent on display and there was an abundance of wide-eyed wonder. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2311.76s)]
*  One, two, three, go, best, go, best. Kids and parents and this correspondent converged on the college. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2316.88s)]
*  Dumo Mukorki was among the showstoppers. Some of them, it's the first time to see this. I bring [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2328.6400000000003s)]
*  happiness to the kids. That's why I feel happy because I'm making them happy. Everybody, the magic [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2334.4s)]
*  plot. You're not just making them happy, you're making them wonder. You're expanding their idea [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2340.1600000000003s)]
*  of possibility and imagination. Yeah, it's a great feeling. It's a great feeling. But you don't give [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2345.76s)]
*  it up when they say, how'd you do it? It's magic. It's magic. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2352.32s)]
*  It sounds like the setup for a joke. At an illustrious Ivy League university, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2367.28s)]
*  famous for taking itself seriously, one student magazine staff devotes itself to publishing parody, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2372.08s)]
*  pulling pranks, and causing general mayhem. Yet here's the punchline. 142 years after its founding, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2378.72s)]
*  the Harvard Lampoon remains as relevant as ever. The wellspring of so much comedy in America today. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2386.08s)]
*  Over the years, the Lampoon has changed in some ways. A long-time male preserve, three of its [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2392.96s)]
*  last five presidents have been women. In other ways, it stayed true to its roots, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2398.16s)]
*  poking fun at the powerful, including the current occupant of the Oval Office, the recent victim of [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2403.12s)]
*  a sly Lampoon prank. While their straight-laced and straight-faced classmates may aspire to become [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2408.64s)]
*  Supreme Court justices, hedge fund titans, and cures of cancer, for a core group of Harvard [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2415.2s)]
*  undergrads, the Lampoon offers vocational training for careers as comedy writers. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2421.2s)]
*  We got a rare glimpse inside the place this winter and caught up with some of the Lampoon's [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2426.8799999999997s)]
*  cast of characters, past and present. A winter night in Cambridge, Massachusetts. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2431.8399999999997s)]
*  As the temperature drops, a line of undergraduates forms outside the castle at 44 Bow Street. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2439.9199999999996s)]
*  This is the headquarters of the Harvard Lampoon. Part comedy magazine, part secret society. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2446.56s)]
*  And these students want in. Akin to rushing a fraternity, the pledges are called compers for [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2452.48s)]
*  the competencies they'll have to demonstrate before landing a spot on the magazine staff [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2459.04s)]
*  and literally scoring keys to the castle. The first test, can they make their upperclassmen [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2464.0s)]
*  judges laugh? Make room for the cameraman please. Our cameras were invited into the castle library [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2470.32s)]
*  to watch upperclassmen put compers on the spot. And right off the bat, Lampoon staffers seized [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2476.0800000000004s)]
*  the opportunity to poke fun at us too. Using a fake microphone, they subjected compers to spoof [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2481.76s)]
*  TV news interviews. Action. So in the fourth grade. Protting them to tell their best stories and [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2488.6400000000003s)]
*  playfully reminding them of our presence. 30 minutes. I like had a bottle of whipped cream [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2494.64s)]
*  with me. Wait 30 minutes or 60 minutes? It's a girl. But the real criteria for admission here, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2499.2799999999997s)]
*  applicants must be funny on paper. They submit six pieces of humor writing to be critiqued by [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2505.52s)]
*  Lampoon members, including Liana Spiro, the current Lampoon president. It's a whole semester [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2511.2s)]
*  of writing comedy and then having other people earnestly read it and spend a lot of time, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2517.12s)]
*  you know, telling you what they think about it. I believe in it strongly. I think people are [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2522.24s)]
*  funnier by the end. But only the funniest survive. Out of about a hundred pledges last semester, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2526.3999999999996s)]
*  six compers made the cut. The semester before that, only three. The initiated will see their [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2532.7999999999997s)]
*  name on the masthead of the Harvard Lampoon, an eclectic periodical full of original illustrations [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2539.52s)]
*  and niche advertising. One recent issue on the theme, just friends, those two words no college [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2546.16s)]
*  kid ever wants to hear includes a dialogue piece on chance encounters, a comic about phone etiquette [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2552.64s)]
*  and in a typical random beat in owed to TV meteorologists. The Lampoon is published five [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2559.2799999999997s)]
*  times a year with a circulation barely extending beyond Harvard's gates. Members are under no [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2566.8799999999997s)]
*  illusions about the magazine's impact. There's a sense here that we are writing the magazine for [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2572.8s)]
*  ourselves and that no one is reading it. And that I think actually is one of the most beautiful [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2578.2400000000002s)]
*  things about the Lampoon that we feel like no one is watching and we can just dance however we want. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2582.4s)]
*  You're doing this for yourself, not the kid across the hall or the kid at the dining hall. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2587.76s)]
*  Yeah, we could print, you know, five copies of the magazine and it would still be worthwhile. And I [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2592.2400000000002s)]
*  think everyone would still be here just as much trying to be just as funny. Officially, members [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2597.36s)]
*  major in everything at Harvard from math to poetry, but the Lampoon is their real area of [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2602.08s)]
*  concentration. Take Alice Ju, philosophy student and former Lampoon president. What percent of your [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2606.72s)]
*  time here at Harvard is devoted to Lampoon versus regular schoolwork? Like 99 percent Lampoon and [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2612.96s)]
*  then one percent sleep I guess and then zero percent regular schoolwork. Your parents are [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2619.2799999999997s)]
*  pleased to hear that. Yeah, I mean they've already given up so I have a younger sister who will be [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2623.7599999999998s)]
*  like doing all the right things while I do this. Most aspire to a career in comedy and the Lampoon [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2628.24s)]
*  serves as their first writer's room. Just as iron sharpens iron, you might say that here irony [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2634.3999999999996s)]
*  sharpens irony. The Lampoon has a rich history of deploying that irony in special edition parodies [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2640.0s)]
*  of other publications. Name a popular magazine and be assured it's been the victim of a Lampoon [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2646.08s)]
*  send-up. This parody of Cosmo complete with Henry Kissinger's centerfold endures as a classic in the [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2651.52s)]
*  genre. Their latest is an absurdist parody of Harvard's daily student newspaper The Crimson, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2658.32s)]
*  but that's just the physical product. Pranks. Cooking them up and then carrying them out are [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2664.4s)]
*  as much a part of the Lampoon tradition as actual humor writing. Lampoon staff invited us to see how [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2671.44s)]
*  it's done. We watched as they fanned out across campus taking that parody issue and scheming to [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2678.0s)]
*  swap it out with the real Crimson. It's a kind of thing they live for. Great. Perfect. For decades [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2684.48s)]
*  the Crimson has been the butt of Lampoon hijinks. Leona Spiro's crowning achievement so far when Mark [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2691.52s)]
*  Zuckerberg returned to Harvard to give a commencement address she hacked into the Crimson's website. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2697.76s)]
*  And we wrote up hundreds of these fake headlines about Mark Zuckerberg in the silliest comedic tone [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2703.28s)]
*  possible. Extremely dumb. Basically the crux of the humor was just changing his name to like mink [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2710.0800000000004s)]
*  sinkletonk like over and over again. Our amusement went unshared by the Harvard Crimson. How upset [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2716.96s)]
*  were they? They were fairly upset. My roommate actually is on the Crimson and this was the only [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2724.7200000000003s)]
*  time that she really was upset at me. She had worked weeks on a very long piece like 10,000 words [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2730.56s)]
*  about some corner of Harvard's administration and then I had worked you know two hours on some [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2737.36s)]
*  headlines about mink zinkletonk and but I'm super pro pranking them all the time. Every once in a [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2742.48s)]
*  while the Lampoon will pull off a prank so bold it achieves comic glory and Tom Wadde currently a [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2750.32s)]
*  senior may have set the new standard. This one started late one night. Wadde recruited some Lampoon [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2756.88s)]
*  conspirators to break into the Crimson headquarters and steal the paper's famous president's chair. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2763.44s)]
*  It was the summer of 2015 and Donald Trump had just announced he was going to run for president. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2769.84s)]
*  Pretending to represent the Crimson, Wadde contacted the Trump campaign and offered up the [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2775.76s)]
*  student newspaper's endorsement. Would Mr. Trump like to pose for the accompanying photo in the [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2780.96s)]
*  Crimson's chair? They say this seems like something that Mr. Trump would be very interested in. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2786.4s)]
*  Waddeck and crew raced from Harvard to Manhattan and parked a few blocks from Trump Tower. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2792.0s)]
*  They lugged the chair in a freight elevator and made it to the 25th floor. By the way the chair is [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2797.28s)]
*  about like 150-200 pounds so it takes like two or three people to to carry it anywhere. With an eye [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2802.2400000000002s)]
*  on the chair Trump welcomes students he believed to be Crimson editors. It's very nice he had his [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2808.48s)]
*  hair fixed. While you were there? While we were there they had they had sort of hairspray and [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2814.24s)]
*  combed it over and stuff and he said people don't think my hair is real but you can all testify this [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2819.04s)]
*  is very real. Once the cosmetics were complete it was time to capture the moment. So he said everyone [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2823.9199999999996s)]
*  do the thumbs up so we're all doing his sort of signature thumbs up around him and I was just like [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2830.8799999999997s)]
*  we got it. Not quite. A few days later as he was preparing to publish the endorsement Waddeck [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2835.7599999999998s)]
*  received a call from Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen. The Trump campaign realized they'd [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2842.24s)]
*  been had. He says you know I'm gonna come up to Harvard you're all gonna get expelled if this photo [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2847.7599999999998s)]
*  gets out you'll be out of that school faster than you know it I can be up there tomorrow. What's that [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2853.3599999999997s)]
*  like? It was I mean it was terrifying he actually he asked me to send my Harvard ID so it could have [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2858.16s)]
*  my identity my information. Did you send it? And I sent it right away I was so afraid that if I didn't [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2863.9199999999996s)]
*  he might actually be crazy enough to fly up here. The Trump campaign never did follow up. The Crimson, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2869.2799999999997s)]
*  Good Sports That They Are, published the story of the prank later that summer complete with photo [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2875.2s)]
*  and with that Tom Waddeck and company gained a measure of lampoon immortality which is saying [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2880.32s)]
*  something given the alumni roles. Early generations count everyone from William Randolph Hearst to [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2886.4s)]
*  George Plimpton to John Updike. What the hell is wrong with you people? The modern era produced [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2892.48s)]

*  from SNL to Seinfeld. He's currently the show runner for HBO's Veep. Veep? Emmy winner for [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2913.44s)]
*  outstanding comedy series three years running. This is for chubby Jews from the Upper West Side. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2920.32s)]
*  What made you want to join the Lampoon? The building. You kind of you can't help but notice [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2926.8s)]
*  it. You know you see a lot of other organizations you go to a lot of other meetings and there's this [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2931.84s)]
*  one place that happens to have a castle and it definitely hits you. It's hard to overstate the [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2937.1200000000003s)]
*  importance of the castle. Built in 1909 in a style described as mock Flemish whatever that means [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2941.6000000000004s)]
*  the exterior almost winks at you foreshadowing farce and inside the Great Hall site of lampoon [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2948.64s)]
*  parties so legendary movies have been made about them. In real life the Great Hall along with most [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2955.44s)]
*  of the castle is strictly off limits to non-members. Our cameras weren't permitted anywhere but the [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2963.04s)]
*  library no matter how many times we asked. We did however track down the unofficial godfather of the [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2969.2799999999997s)]
*  place. Jim Downey class of 74 cuts a mythical figure within Harvard Lampoon circles. The [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2975.68s)]
*  centerfold. The guy responsible for that Kissinger centerfold fondly recalls his late nights at the [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2981.9199999999996s)]
*  castle. We thought it was the funniest thing on earth to pointlessly put the word frankly [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2987.44s)]
*  into any answer to questions so it could be like um what bus goes up 10th Avenue? Frankly the M11 [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=2994.0s)]
*  or what what uh what planet has the most eccentric orbit? Frankly Mercury. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3001.36s)]
*  Downey made a career of mining humor from the mundane. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3010.4s)]
*  Frankly he's also written some of the most enduring political satire of the last 40 years. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3014.4s)]
*  Sum up in a single word the best argument for his candidacy. Governor Bush? Strategy. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3020.32s)]
*  For decades Downey sketches cold open Saturday Night Live. Yet asked him Downey about his most [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3027.12s)]
*  memorable moment in comedy and he harkens back to January of 1974 when he and the Lampoon invited [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3036.08s)]
*  John Wayne to campus and it became news. The Lampoon challenged conservative Wayne to come to Harvard. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3042.4s)]
*  Wayne not only accepted he rode through town on a tank that Downey and accomplices had borrowed [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3049.8399999999997s)]
*  from a nearby military installation. You still recall the party that night? It's traditional for [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3055.28s)]
*  people to get up and dance on the table and Wayne was was right up there with with didn't have to be [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3060.2400000000002s)]
*  coaxed. Downey's most lasting contribution he opened an employment pipeline hiring and referring [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3065.1200000000003s)]
*  countless Lampoon alumni who now fill writers rooms that shows from Curb Your Enthusiasm to Silicon [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3071.36s)]
*  Valley. Al Jean class of 81 came through the Downey pipeline and now runs the Simpsons the longest [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3077.6800000000003s)]
*  running comedy in television history. Half his writing staff is former Lampoon. So it is that [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3084.8s)]
*  more than a few subversive references to their alma mater make their way into Simpson's episode. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3091.1200000000003s)]
*  I better get a little respect once I get that Harvard diploma. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3097.36s)]
*  I'll be honest I read scripts to hire people and um I'll read a script and go oh that's great and [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3102.2400000000002s)]
*  then I'll look at the background of the person and I'll go oh no Lampoon I didn't want to hire [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3107.52s)]
*  Why oh no? Well because I wanted the show to be much more diverse. You're not actively seeking out [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3112.2400000000002s)]
*  Lampoon alumni? Never actively. We found a motley crew when we visited the castle last May [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3118.48s)]
*  but the Lampoon pipeline to TV writers rooms has been called a mafia one that favors Lampoon alumni [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3124.7200000000003s)]
*  to the exclusion of more diverse voices. When alumni come back they're almost all men sometimes [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3130.6400000000003s)]
*  they all feel like clones of each other it's like white men of varying ages who are into comedy [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3136.88s)]
*  and you just feel like none of these people look like me. What do we do about that? I think just [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3141.68s)]
*  like saying to the world that we have noticed that we're not diverse and that we aren't happy [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3146.72s)]
*  with that and want to change could do a lot. Back in Hollywood David Mandel is watching and reading [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3152.0s)]
*  this current generation. He has two pieces of sage advice. Make me laugh that's all I care about make [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3158.08s)]
*  me laugh is it funny and then just kind of hoping that the undergrads don't burn the place down. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3165.2s)]
*  You're carrying the torch now your job is not to burn down this place. Yes. Can you handle that [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3171.44s)]
*  challenge? Well the fire alarm has gone off four times in the last year so that would indicate [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3175.84s)]
*  perhaps no but the Lampoon is still standing so we'll see. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1CGR2TuA7s&t=3180.7200000000003s)]
