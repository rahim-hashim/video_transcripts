**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls)
*  Over the years, we've reported on the more than half a million U.S. servicemen and women [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=0.0s)]
*  who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=12.68s)]
*  I couldn't even make sense of it, but... [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Tonight, you'll hear PTSD can be contagious. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=20.52s)]
*  The worst of it was in seventh grade. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=25.16s)]
*  I kind of decided that my family would be better off without me here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=27.68s)]
*  NVIDIA has had a blistering ride to the top of the stock market. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Bill, look at this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=38.44s)]
*  How does NVIDIA's technology make artificial intelligence possible? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=39.24s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=43.0s)]
*  I am Fiona, a representation of mother nature. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=43.72s)]
*  It does quadrillions of calculations a second. It's just insane numbers. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  And medical researchers and high-tech companies tell us this technology will affect our lives [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=53.04s)]
*  in ways we can only imagine. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=59.12s)]
*  This is wild. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=61.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=62.72s)]
*  It's an incredible feat. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=65.64s)]
*  Pearl Harbor's Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=67.6s)]
*  Seven miles of tunnels cut through volcanic rock built to hold 250 million gallons of fuel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=71.4s)]
*  So this is one of the tanks. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=79.24s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  And to give you kind of a reference point, the Statue of Liberty, not the base, but the statue itself, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=82.56s)]
*  can fit in here with enough room. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=87.48s)]
*  Tonight, you'll hear what happened at this once secret site [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=90.56s)]
*  and how it's affected thousands of military families. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=94.8s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=100.80000000000001s)]

*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=105.08s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=107.72s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=109.08s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=110.56s)]
*  Two million Americans served in Afghanistan and Iraq, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=121.88s)]
*  and at least 600,000 have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=126.11999999999999s)]
*  For the most part, the U.S. is doing better, recognizing and treating these wounded warriors. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  But less well-known are millions more who are in need but remain hidden. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=137.96s)]
*  They are the children living with injured veterans. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  In a profound sense, PTSD can be contagious. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  Many children have become caregivers confronting depression and fear. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  And you will hear tonight that the stress can be so great, it can lead to attempts of suicide. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=158.44s)]
*  You're about to meet two courageous families who spoke to us [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=165.64s)]
*  so that others can know that help is on the way for America's children of war. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=169.83999999999997s)]
*  In 2011, Chuck Rotenberry was a Marine on patrol in Afghanistan [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=178.48s)]
*  when an improvised landmine detonated a few feet away. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  Which sent me down a hill 20, 30 feet, knocked me out. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=189.11999999999998s)]
*  Caused catastrophic injuries to the Marine behind me and the Marine behind him. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=196.6s)]
*  It was Rotenberry's second combat tour after Iraq. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  What happened to the Marine behind you who had stepped on the IED? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=206.27999999999997s)]
*  He lost both his legs above the knee. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=210.32s)]
*  You and the medic put the tourniquets on him? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=215.27999999999997s)]
*  You saved his life? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  I helped out, yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  When Rotenberry came home from his seven-month deployment, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=221.2s)]
*  his wife Liz was pregnant with their fourth child. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=224.92s)]
*  Chuck was suffering with a brain injury from a concussion and PTSD. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=228.56s)]
*  Chuck was struggling to just be in the house [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=234.24s)]
*  because he was dealing with so many emotions mentally and physically. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=237.88s)]
*  He was hiding in, you know, back rooms and I'd find him crying. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=244.6s)]
*  And he didn't understand why he was crying. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=248.84s)]
*  I didn't know whether I was coming or going. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=252.04s)]
*  Chuck kept a video diary as he dealt with self-isolation, anxiety, depression and denial. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=255.36s)]
*  One second I'm up super high and the next I'm not. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=264.44s)]
*  Chuck, who was that man who came home? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=270.0s)]
*  In my head, it was me. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=273.6s)]
*  But I was very far from it, I think. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=276.48s)]
*  At age seven, his son Christopher pitched in. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=281.36s)]
*  Over the years, he tried to shield his dad from triggers that set him off [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  and shield his sisters from the emotional trauma. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=290.32s)]
*  I was just worried about a lot of different things. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=294.0s)]
*  Things that kids, I guess, at that age should not be worried about. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=297.04s)]
*  And it kind of evolved into kind of like a helplessness. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=304.8s)]
*  He was becoming almost like my husband. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  There were times where he wouldn't be able to go to school [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  because he was so stressed internally from everything happening [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  and I don't think he knew how to process it and understand it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=323.6s)]
*  I knew Christopher was starting to struggle with the weight of it all. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=326.76s)]
*  The weight grew as Chris turned 12. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=332.84000000000003s)]
*  The worst of it was in seventh grade. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=336.72s)]
*  I think I had kind of decided that my family would be better off without me here. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=339.6s)]
*  I remember looking back on those days, it was just chaos all the time. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  And I... [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=353.6s)]
*  I remember taking one of the dog's leashes upstairs [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=366.0s)]
*  and tied one into the bunk bed that we had, my little brother's bunk bed. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=373.68s)]
*  I tried hanging myself and it was working. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=379.35999999999996s)]
*  And my mom walked in on me, kind of, and I think I was kind of about to pass out. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=386.08s)]
*  I was kind of losing consciousness. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=393.67999999999995s)]
*  Walking in and seeing what was happening to him [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=398.64s)]
*  and what he was really struggling with, I knew everything else had to stop. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=401.28s)]
*  Everything just had to stop and my focus had to be Christopher. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=406.64s)]
*  Liz became the warrior fighting for her family. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=410.72s)]
*  Christopher went to intensive therapy. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=414.96s)]
*  Then he and his sisters enrolled in a clinic for military children confronting PTSD. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=417.68s)]
*  It's hard as a military family to own that. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=425.2s)]
*  When you're built with such pride and strength [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=427.44s)]
*  and you're seen as resilient as the word is in our community, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=432.32s)]
*  but it's okay to not be resilient and it's okay to ask for help. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=436.0s)]
*  Therapy saved your family. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=441.92s)]
*  It did. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=443.44s)]
*  Little was known about families like the Rotenberries [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=447.2s)]
*  until the wife of a wounded warrior spent 10 months [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=451.04s)]
*  at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=455.28s)]
*  Elizabeth Dole, former senator and transportation secretary, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=459.04s)]
*  heard these families while caring for the late senator Bob Dole. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=463.84s)]
*  I met all of these young spouses, mothers, dads, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  who were caring for their wounded warriors. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  I don't think America is aware of what's happening. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=475.11999999999995s)]
*  Most Americans have no idea what's happening in these military families. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=478.0s)]
*  Less than 1% are serving in the military today. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  Less than 1% are protecting our freedom and our security. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=486.88s)]
*  And it's so important for us to raise awareness [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=490.72s)]
*  of their challenges and their needs and provide them with the support. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=493.6s)]
*  Dole created a foundation that commissions studies of military caregivers. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=498.24s)]
*  The studies discovered that more than 1 million [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=504.32000000000005s)]
*  are caring for those injured during the war since 9-11. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=507.92s)]
*  Nearly half said they were overwhelmed. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=512.4s)]
*  They felt guilty really that they were leaning on their children [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=516.48s)]
*  needing their support and that this was causing problems for the children. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=521.52s)]
*  There are 2.3 million military children living in the homes of wounded warriors. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=526.8s)]
*  One of them is Elizabeth Cornelius. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=533.04s)]
*  And I just need to make sure everybody's okay, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  because if my mom isn't okay, everything's going to just fall. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=538.7199999999999s)]
*  Elizabeth has helped her mom, Ariel, as long as she can remember. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=542.8s)]
*  Even before she was born, her dad brought terrifying memories home from a combat tour in Iraq. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=547.76s)]
*  Ariel told us his first episode came with a pizza delivery. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=555.68s)]
*  The delivery man came up to the door and knocked on the door. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=561.1999999999999s)]
*  And my husband didn't expect it and he had an immediate flashback and threw me to the floor [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=564.56s)]
*  and was yelling, get down, get down, get down, get down. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=570.8s)]
*  Even with that, he deployed to Iraq again in 2007 and to Afghanistan in 2011. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=573.6800000000001s)]
*  Ariel is a schoolteacher. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=583.28s)]
*  Her husband is completely disabled by PTSD. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=584.96s)]
*  He can't work and wasn't up to speaking with us. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=588.88s)]
*  16-year-old Elizabeth has become something of a co-parent to a brother and sister at home in [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=593.36s)]
*  Montana, shielding them, she told us, from episodes and arguments. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=599.12s)]
*  I just try to shield them as much as I can, as my mom did for me, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=604.9599999999999s)]
*  and she did it for a very long time. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  A lot of it falls on myself, and then she goes out and helps pick up the pieces that I can't. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=610.0s)]
*  Her husband's worst crisis came on the anniversary of an attack that killed several of his fellow [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=615.8399999999999s)]
*  Marines. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=622.88s)]
*  Um, oh gosh. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=624.0s)]
*  He was extremely suicidal because of all the memories that came back. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=626.56s)]
*  He was barely hanging on and it's just that regret. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=632.56s)]
*  It's the flow of memories that come in. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=636.48s)]
*  Extremely suicidal, but Ariel found beds for inpatient mental health care can be scarce. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=641.28s)]
*  You know, Helena is an hour and a half, two hours away. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=649.36s)]
*  Casper, Wyoming is eight plus hours away, and they didn't have a bed. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=653.2s)]
*  We then looked at Idaho, they didn't have a bed. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=657.44s)]
*  We looked at Oregon, they didn't have a bed. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=659.84s)]
*  We still ended up having to wait three weeks before he could get the support he needed [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=661.76s)]
*  in Puget Sound, Washington, and you know, that's 10 hours away. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=666.32s)]
*  Three weeks during this time, you felt like he could commit suicide? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=671.6s)]
*  At any point in time. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=676.0s)]
*  And we couldn't get help. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=679.36s)]
*  Chasing care in a crisis and navigating government health insurance raised stress for everyone. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=681.36s)]
*  It's rough on her because she's been on the phone for hours and hours reading pamphlets, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=689.04s)]
*  trying to find us help. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=696.48s)]
*  In 2018, Elizabeth Dole watched President Trump sign a law that expanded VA benefits [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=698.8s)]
*  for caregivers of the severely disabled. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=705.12s)]
*  It offers a stipend, access to health insurance and counseling. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=708.56s)]
*  The Dole Foundation's studies found that at least 100 other organizations are providing support, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=713.68s)]
*  which now include the Dole Foundation itself. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=721.28s)]
*  Steve Schwab is the CEO. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=724.64s)]
*  How does the Foundation help these children? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=726.96s)]
*  One of the first things that we do is we offer emergency financial support to anybody who needs [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=730.08s)]
*  it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=734.0s)]
*  Second is peer support. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=734.56s)]
*  We're building a first of its kind peer support model that will link these children with other [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=736.4s)]
*  children like them for the first time in their lives. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=741.36s)]
*  We offer on the ground, respite care, backup care in the home to provide a trained health care [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=744.8s)]
*  worker to come in and back up that mom or dad so that that family can take a break together. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=750.0s)]
*  One Dole Foundation partner called Our Military Kids paid fees to help keep the Cornelius children [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=755.68s)]
*  in sports. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=763.36s)]
*  Their mom, Ariel, says that even the little things help her husband. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=764.72s)]
*  He is an amazing man and I can't wait for him to get past, and I know he'll never get past the PTSD, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=771.12s)]
*  but for him to heal enough to enjoy life and to be able to enjoy the family dynamics and those [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=778.72s)]
*  just being around. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=786.08s)]
*  You have hope for that? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=788.32s)]
*  I sure do, yeah. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=789.6s)]
*  Today, Liz Rotenberry leads a Dole Foundation initiative to train caregivers to be public [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=791.1199999999999s)]
*  advocates, for example, on Capitol Hill. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=797.5999999999999s)]
*  Husband Chuck is recovering and works as a dog trainer for the Secret Service, and son [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=801.68s)]
*  Christopher recovered and has applied to follow his father into the military. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=808.0799999999999s)]
*  After all the things that Chris did to help the family during your troubles, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=814.32s)]
*  what would you like your son to know? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=822.0s)]
*  First of all, everybody, everybody that's in my life now, I wouldn't be here without them. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=826.6400000000001s)]
*  I tell him I love him all the time, and he replies. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=834.1600000000001s)]
*  And he replies. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=838.88s)]
*  But I never really say why. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=843.28s)]
*  Watching him grow, being aware of other people, there's plenty of proud dad moments for me. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=846.8000000000001s)]
*  But I'm proud of you every day. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=859.6800000000001s)]
*  All the time. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=866.64s)]
*  You owe me nothing but to be happy. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=869.44s)]
*  More than just about anything, these families told us they want the nation to simply see [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=879.28s)]
*  and know the children living with disabled vets who are, in a sense, still fighting [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=885.76s)]
*  America's post-9-11 wars. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=892.88s)]
*  Only four companies in the world are worth more than $2 trillion – Microsoft, Apple, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=898.48s)]
*  Alphabet, parent company of Google, and computer chip maker Nvidia. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=911.12s)]
*  The California-based company saw its stock market value soar from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in just [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=916.24s)]
*  eight months this past year, fueled by the insatiable demand for its cutting-edge technology, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=923.44s)]
*  the hardware and software that make today's artificial intelligence possible. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=929.7600000000001s)]
*  We wondered how a company founded in 1993 to improve video game graphics turned into a [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=935.12s)]
*  titan of 21st century AI. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=941.6s)]
*  So we went to Silicon Valley to meet Nvidia's 61-year-old co-founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=944.72s)]
*  who has no doubt AI is about to change everything. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=952.24s)]
*  At Nvidia's annual Developers Conference this past March, the mood wasn't just upbeat. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=965.04s)]
*  It was downright giddy. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=972.88s)]
*  More than 11,000 enthusiasts, software developers, tech moguls, and happy shareholders [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=975.04s)]
*  filed into San Jose's pro-hockey arena to kick off a four-day AI extravaganza. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=982.08s)]
*  They came to see this man, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=989.9200000000001s)]
*  What was it like for you to walk out on that stage and see that? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=999.12s)]
*  You know, Bill, I'm an engineer, not a performer. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1002.72s)]
*  When I walked out there and all of the people going crazy, it took the breath out of me. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1005.6800000000001s)]
*  And so I was the scariest I've ever been. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1011.2s)]
*  I'm still scared. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1013.6s)]
*  You'd never know it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1015.84s)]
*  Clad in his signature cool black outfit, Jensen shared the stage with Nvidia-powered robots. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1017.44s)]
*  Let me finish up real quick. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1023.9200000000001s)]
*  And shared his vision of an AI future. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1025.3600000000001s)]
*  A new industrial revolution. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1028.32s)]
*  It reminded us of the transformational moment when Apple's Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1030.64s)]
*  Jensen Huang unveiled Nvidia's latest graphics processing unit, or GPU. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1037.04s)]
*  This is Blackwell. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1043.2s)]
*  Designed in America, but made in Taiwan, like most advanced semiconductors, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1044.56s)]
*  Blackwell, he says, is the fastest chip ever. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1049.52s)]
*  Google is gearing up for Blackwell. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1053.12s)]
*  The whole industry is gearing up for Blackwell. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1055.6s)]
*  Nvidia ushered in the AI revolution with its game-changing GPU, a single chip able to process [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1058.6399999999999s)]
*  a myriad of calculations all at once, not sequentially like more standard chips. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1066.0s)]
*  The GPU is the engine of Nvidia's AI computer, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1072.16s)]
*  enabling it to rapidly absorb a fire hose of information. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1076.32s)]
*  It does quadrillions of calculations a second. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1080.8s)]
*  It's just insane numbers. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1084.32s)]
*  Is it doing things now that surprise you? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1086.4s)]
*  We're hoping that it does things that surprise us. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1088.8s)]
*  That's the whole point. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1090.64s)]
*  In some areas like drug discovery, designing better materials that are lighter, stronger, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1092.0s)]
*  we need artificial intelligence to help us explore the universe [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1097.8400000000001s)]
*  in places that we could have never done ourselves. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1101.8400000000001s)]
*  Let me show you. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1104.0800000000002s)]
*  Here, Bill, look at this. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1105.2s)]
*  Jensen took us around the GTC convention hall to show us what AI has made possible [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1106.4s)]
*  in just the past few years. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1112.72s)]
*  I'm making you a drink now. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1114.8s)]
*  Some creations were dazzling. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1116.3200000000002s)]
*  This is a digital twin of the Earth. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1118.8s)]
*  Once it learns how to calculate weather, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1121.36s)]
*  it can calculate and predict weather 3,000 times faster than a supercomputer [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1123.36s)]
*  and 1,000 times less energy. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1129.28s)]
*  But Nvidia's AI revolution extends far beyond this hall. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1132.48s)]
*  Blue metallic spaceship. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1137.36s)]
*  And let's generate something. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1141.6s)]
*  Pinar Seyhan Demirda is originally from Istanbul, but co-founded Kubrick near Boston. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1142.72s)]
*  Her AI application uses Nvidia's GPUs to instantly turn a simple text prompt [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1149.6000000000001s)]
*  into a virtual movie set for a fraction of the cost of today's backdrops. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1156.16s)]
*  This isn't something that's already planned. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1161.28s)]
*  No, we're doing it in real time. It's live. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1163.92s)]
*  Is Hollywood knocking at your door? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1166.8s)]
*  We're getting a lot of love. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1169.76s)]
*  Nearby, at Generate Biomedicines, Dr. Alex Snyder, head of research and development, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1171.2800000000002s)]
*  is using Nvidia's technology to create protein-based drugs. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1178.64s)]
*  She was surprised at first to see they showed promise in the lab. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1183.44s)]
*  Initially, when I was told about the application of AI to drug development, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1187.44s)]
*  I sort of rolled my eyes and said, yeah, show me the data. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1191.3600000000001s)]
*  And then I looked at the data and it was very compelling. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1195.44s)]
*  Dr. Snyder's team asks its AI models to create new proteins to fight specific diseases like [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1198.72s)]
*  cancer and asthma. A new way to defeat the coronavirus is now in clinical trials. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1205.68s)]
*  You're now working with proteins that do not exist in nature, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1212.3200000000002s)]
*  that you're coming up with by way of AI? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1216.64s)]
*  Yes. We are actually generating what we call de novo, completely new [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1220.16s)]

*  Do you trust it? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1227.68s)]
*  As scientists, we can't trust. We have to test. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1229.1200000000001s)]
*  We're not putting Frankensteins into people. We're taking what's known [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1231.8400000000001s)]
*  and we're really pushing the field. We're pushing the biology to make drugs that [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1235.52s)]
*  look like regular drugs but function even better. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1240.72s)]
*  This is a technology that will only get better from here. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1243.6000000000001s)]
*  Brett Adcock is CEO of Figure, a Silicon Valley startup with funding from Nvidia. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1246.16s)]
*  Look at his answer to labor shortages, an Nvidia GPU-driven prototype called Figure 1. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1253.04s)]
*  I think what's been really extraordinary is the pace of progress we've made in 21 months. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1260.96s)]
*  From zero to this in 21 months? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1265.28s)]
*  Zero to this, yeah. We were walking this robot [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1266.64s)]
*  in under a year since I incorporated the company. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1269.52s)]
*  Could you do this without Nvidia's technology? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1272.16s)]
*  We think they're arguably the best in the world at this. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1274.96s)]
*  I don't know if this would be possible without them. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1278.16s)]
*  I'm here to assist with tasks as requested. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1280.96s)]
*  We were amazed that Figure 1 is not just walking but seemed to reason. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1284.3200000000002s)]
*  Hand me something healthy. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1290.48s)]
*  On it. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1293.2800000000002s)]
*  Figure 1 was able to understand I wanted the orange, not the packaged snack. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1294.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1299.92s)]
*  It's not yet perfected. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1301.2s)]

*  But the early results are so promising, German automaker BMW [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1303.68s)]
*  plans to start testing the robot in its South Carolina factory this year. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1308.56s)]
*  I think there's an opportunity to ship billions of robots in the coming decades onto the planet. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1313.84s)]
*  Billions. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1320.72s)]
*  I would think that a lot of workers would look at that as this robot is taking my job. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1321.9199999999998s)]
*  I think over time, AI and robotics will start doing more and more of what humans can and better. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1328.96s)]
*  What about the worker? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1335.6799999999998s)]
*  The workers work for companies. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1337.68s)]
*  And so companies, when they become more productive, earnings increase. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1340.0s)]
*  I've never seen one company that had earnings increase and not hire more people. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1345.44s)]
*  There are some jobs that are going to become obsolete. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1351.28s)]
*  Well, let me offer it this way. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1355.68s)]
*  I believe that you still want human in the loop because we have good judgment, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1357.3600000000001s)]
*  because there are circumstances that the machines are not just not going to understand. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1362.16s)]
*  The futuristic Nvidia campus sits just down the road from its modest birthplace, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1365.92s)]
*  this Denny's in San Jose. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1372.08s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1374.48s)]
*  Where 31 years ago, Nvidia was just an idea. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1375.2s)]
*  My goodness. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1379.36s)]
*  When he was 15, Jensen Huang worked as a dishwasher at Denny's. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1380.48s)]
*  As a 30-year-old electrical engineer married with two children, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1385.04s)]
*  he and two friends, Nvidia co-founders Chris Malachowski and Curtis Priem, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1389.52s)]
*  envisioned a whole new way of processing video game graphics. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1395.92s)]
*  So we came here, right here to this Denny's, sat right back there, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1400.56s)]
*  and the three of us decided to start the company. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1404.4s)]
*  Frankly, I had no idea how to do it. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1407.12s)]
*  And nor did they. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1409.68s)]
*  None of us knew how to do anything. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1410.8s)]
*  Their big idea? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1412.8799999999999s)]
*  Accelerate the processing power of computers with a new graphics chip. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1414.56s)]
*  Their initial attempt flopped and nearly bankrupted the company in 1996. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1419.92s)]
*  And the genius of the engineers and Chris and Curtis, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1425.92s)]
*  we pivoted to the right way of doing things. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1430.08s)]
*  And created their groundbreaking GPU. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1432.8s)]
*  The chip took video games from this [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1435.84s)]
*  to this today. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1440.48s)]
*  Completely changed computer graphics, saved the company, launched us into the stratosphere. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1442.4s)]
*  Just eight years after Denny's, Nvidia earned a spot in the S&P 500. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1450.08s)]
*  Jensen then set his sights on developing the software and hardware [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1455.76s)]
*  for a revolutionary GPU-driven supercomputer, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1460.0s)]
*  which would take the company far beyond video games. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1463.92s)]
*  To Wall Street, it was a risky bet. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1468.0s)]
*  To early developers of A.I., it was a revelation. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1470.6399999999999s)]
*  Was that luck or was that vision? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1474.72s)]
*  That was luck founded by vision. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1477.12s)]
*  We invented this capability. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1480.32s)]
*  And then one day, the researchers that were creating deep learning [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1482.56s)]
*  discovered this architecture. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1488.3999999999999s)]
*  Because this architecture turns out to have been perfect for them. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1490.4799999999998s)]
*  Perfect for A.I.? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1493.52s)]
*  Perfect for A.I. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1494.56s)]
*  This is the first one we've ever shipped. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1495.6799999999998s)]
*  In 2016, Jensen delivered Nvidia's A.I. supercomputer, the first of its kind, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1498.4799999999998s)]
*  to Elon Musk, then a board member of Open A.I., [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1504.32s)]
*  which used it to create the building blocks of chat GPT. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1508.3999999999999s)]
*  How are you? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1512.56s)]
*  When A.I. took off, so did Jensen Huang's reputation. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1513.36s)]
*  Can we get a picture? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1519.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1520.72s)]
*  He's now a Silicon Valley celebrity. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1521.28s)]
*  He told us the boy who immigrated from Taiwan at age nine could never have conceived of this. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1524.08s)]
*  It is the most extraordinary thing, Bill, that a normal dishwasher busboy could grow up to be this. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1531.12s)]
*  There's no magic. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1539.1999999999998s)]
*  It's just 61 years of hard work every single day. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1540.2399999999998s)]
*  I don't think there's anything more than that. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1545.84s)]
*  We met a humble Jensen at Denny's back at Nvidia's headquarters in Santa Clara. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1548.1599999999999s)]
*  We saw he can be intense. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1553.9199999999998s)]
*  Let me tell you what some of the people who you work with said about you. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1557.12s)]
*  Demanding, perfectionist, not easy to work for. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1561.12s)]
*  All that sound right? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1565.6799999999998s)]
*  Perfectly, yeah. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1566.7199999999998s)]
*  It should be like that. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1568.8s)]

*  What you can't see is the once-secret storage site [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1763.76s)]
*  that provided fuel for the Pacific fleet and its planes for 80 years. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1767.28s)]
*  It doesn't look like much from the outside. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1772.88s)]
*  Wait till you get inside. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1774.96s)]
*  Vice Admiral John Wade led us through the Red Hill bulk fuel storage facility. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1776.48s)]
*  Seven miles of tunnels cut through volcanic rock built to hold 250 million gallons of fuel. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1782.08s)]
*  So this is one of the tanks. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1789.68s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1791.3600000000001s)]
*  That black hole is a steel-lined fuel tank so deep it's hard to see the bottom 20 stories below. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1793.28s)]
*  To just show you how enormous this is, this tank holds 12.5 million gallons. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1800.64s)]
*  And to give you kind of a reference point, the Statue of Liberty, not the base, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1805.6799999999998s)]
*  but the statue itself can fit in here with enough room. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1808.9599999999998s)]
*  And this is just one of the 20 tanks hidden here. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1813.76s)]
*  This is the Arizona, writhing in death agony. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1818.08s)]
*  When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, construction was already underway [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1821.52s)]
*  to protect the Navy's fuel reserves from an aerial attack. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1826.08s)]
*  The decision was made to embark on a hurling task to build a bulk storage fuel facility [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1830.0s)]
*  inside a mountain in secrecy. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1836.8799999999999s)]
*  And how long did that take to do? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1839.04s)]
*  It was a little less than three years. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1842.0s)]
*  At its peak, there are about 4,000 men working here. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1844.24s)]
*  But this testament to American resolve became a monumental liability after this. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1849.52s)]
*  That's jet fuel spraying from a cracked pipe. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1855.1999999999998s)]
*  The video was recorded by a worker inside Red Hill on November 20th of 2021. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1858.2399999999998s)]
*  The fuel, 20,000 gallons of it, was trapped in a plastic pipe. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1865.1999999999998s)]
*  The weight caused the pipe to sag. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1870.08s)]
*  This trolley hit it and jet fuel spewed for 21 hours, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1872.7199999999998s)]
*  close to the well that supplied drinking water for 93,000 people on and around the base [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1877.52s)]
*  at Pearl Harbor. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1883.92s)]
*  According to Navy investigators, the workers who responded [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1887.2s)]
*  didn't have the right tools to contain the spill. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1890.4s)]
*  They also assumed there was no danger to the drinking water. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1893.04s)]
*  They were wrong. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1896.4s)]
*  At least 5,000 gallons of jet fuel drained into the tunnel floor [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1897.6000000000001s)]
*  and into the Navy water system. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1902.4s)]
*  The next day, the Navy issued a press release about the incident [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1905.3600000000001s)]
*  and told the 8,400 families living in military housing, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1909.1200000000001s)]
*  the water remains safe to drink, even though the Navy had not tested the water yet. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1912.96s)]
*  A week later, residents began to notice a problem. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1919.04s)]
*  When did you get the sense that there was something wrong with the water? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1923.28s)]
*  My husband came into the kitchen and washed his hands and said, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1926.48s)]
*  gosh, the water smells like I just did an oil change. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1930.48s)]
*  Like the water smells weird. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1934.0s)]
*  Brittany Traeger lived on base, about two and a half miles from Red Hill, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1936.0s)]
*  with her daughter and husband, who is a Navy chief petty officer. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1940.0s)]
*  Traeger says she began to feel sick a week after the spill. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1944.48s)]
*  I had a cough. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1948.56s)]
*  My tonsils were very swollen. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1949.84s)]
*  I remember a very distinct moment where I was walking to the car [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1951.84s)]
*  and I had vertigo so bad that I had to hold on to the car. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1955.36s)]
*  The smell was that overwhelming. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1959.2s)]
*  In an email to residents nine days after the spill, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1962.24s)]
*  the commanding officer of the base reassured residents [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1965.44s)]
*  there are no immediate indications that the water is not safe. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1968.72s)]
*  My staff and I are drinking the water. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1972.64s)]
*  Did you stop using water? Did you stop taking baths? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1975.52s)]
*  So I did. My daughter did. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1979.2s)]
*  Just because you had a bad feeling, not because anybody told you to? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1981.6000000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1984.72s)]
*  They gave us an email address that we could send an email to [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1985.44s)]
*  if we wanted to have our water tested. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1989.04s)]
*  So I emailed those people who then emailed me a phone number that I should call [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1991.68s)]
*  and I called that phone number for days and it was just busy. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1995.92s)]
*  They were overwhelmed and inundated with reports. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=1999.44s)]
*  Ten days after the spill, there were more than 200 reports from six neighborhoods across the base [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2004.3200000000002s)]
*  of strong fuel odor coming from kitchen and bathroom faucets. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2010.5600000000002s)]
*  But the Navy said its initial tests did not detect fuel. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2014.88s)]
*  It defied logic, you know, even though there was a leak [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2019.44s)]
*  and even though our water smelled like jet fuel [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2023.2s)]
*  and even though there was sheen on it, they continued to say the tests are coming back negative. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2025.52s)]
*  After 12 days and four statements assuring residents the water was not contaminated with [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2031.52s)]
*  fuel, the Navy reversed course. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2037.3600000000001s)]
*  On December 2, 2021, it announced more comprehensive tests conducted by the Navy [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2040.96s)]
*  had detected jet fuel in the water. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2047.68s)]
*  Three weeks after the spill, tests from Hawaii's Department of Health [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2050.88s)]
*  revealed jet fuel levels 350 times higher than what the state considers safe. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2054.64s)]
*  Rochelle Dietz lives on base with her husband, a Navy chief petty officer, and their two children. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2062.3199999999997s)]
*  Jet fuel is not something that you would even think could happen to be in your water. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2068.24s)]
*  How were people reacting to the news? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2072.96s)]
*  I was so sick to my stomach from that news that I actually threw up when I heard. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2075.6s)]
*  Because why? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2081.44s)]
*  Because my kids had just been poisoned. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2082.72s)]
*  Within a month, the Navy set up medical tents for residents. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2085.3599999999997s)]
*  Some complained of stomach problems, severe fatigue and coughing. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2089.12s)]
*  The military moved more than 4,000 families to hotels. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2093.2799999999997s)]
*  Small studies of military personnel suggest jet fuel exposure [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2098.0s)]
*  can lead to neurological and breathing problems. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2102.64s)]
*  But the long-term impact of ingesting jet fuel is unknown because it's so unlikely to ever happen. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2105.7599999999998s)]
*  Rochelle Dietz told us days after the spill, her daughter's tonsils became inflamed [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2113.44s)]
*  and her son started suffering from chronic headaches. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2118.64s)]
*  I can hear people saying, tonsils, headaches, kids get that stuff. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2122.08s)]
*  How do you know it's related? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2126.4s)]
*  Because they never had it before November of 2021. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2128.64s)]
*  It wasn't an issue. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2132.7999999999997s)]
*  It's unclear how many got sick, but of 2,000 people who responded to a survey [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2134.7999999999997s)]
*  by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 850 sought medical care. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2140.08s)]
*  The water system was flushed over three months and bottled water brought in. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2146.48s)]
*  Brittany Traeger said her four-year-old now suffers respiratory problems, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2153.12s)]
*  which require hour-long treatments at least two times a day. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2157.36s)]
*  That includes a nebulizer and this vibrating vest to clear her lungs. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2161.68s)]
*  Tell me about your daughter's health. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2166.96s)]
*  13 days after the contamination, after our water smelled like jet fuel, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2168.96s)]
*  my daughter woke up in the hotel with a cough and it pretty much never went away. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2177.6000000000004s)]
*  Three months passed before Pearl Harbor's drinking water was deemed safe again. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2186.8s)]
*  The Navy's own investigation into the spill described quote, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2191.84s)]
*  cascading failures and revealed poor training, supervision and ineffective leadership at Red [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2195.44s)]
*  Hill that fell unacceptably short of Navy standards. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2201.36s)]
*  For the last 10 years, Hawaiians have raised concerns about the threat from smaller leaks [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2206.4s)]
*  at Red Hill. The primary water supply for the city of Honolulu is 100 feet below the Navy complex. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2211.36s)]
*  In March of 2022, the Secretary of Defense ordered Red Hill permanently closed. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2220.0s)]
*  Vice Admiral John Wade was brought in to get the 104 million gallons of fuel out of the tanks [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2226.88s)]
*  and move it safely to sites around the Pacific. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2232.96s)]
*  We've got to defuel. That's the imminent threat. There's ongoing and will be continued long-term [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2236.16s)]
*  environmental remediation to restore the aquifer, the land and surrounding area, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2242.48s)]
*  and then there's also a medical component for those that have been impacted. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2248.16s)]
*  You view now this thing that was a lifeline for the fleet is a threat. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2251.6s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2256.48s)]
*  In six months, Wade's team in Hawaii successfully removed almost all of the fuel. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2258.3999999999996s)]
*  But it took two years before the Navy issued disciplinary letters to 14 officers [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2263.92s)]
*  involved in the spill response, including five admirals. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2269.52s)]
*  Was anyone fired because of this? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2273.8399999999997s)]
*  At the time that the accountability came through, we had officers that had already retired, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2275.8399999999997s)]
*  and so they had already separated from service. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2281.3599999999997s)]
*  Meredith Berger is an Assistant Secretary of the Navy. We met her at the Pentagon in November. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2286.3999999999996s)]
*  She told us the Navy has been accountable. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2291.9199999999996s)]
*  We're talking about 20,000 gallons of fuel leak. 90,000 people had their water contaminated. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2295.2s)]
*  Water contaminated. It looks like people retired or were reassigned and no one was fired. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2301.92s)]
*  How is that accountability? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2308.96s)]
*  It's accountability within the system that we have established. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2311.36s)]
*  And we have heard that this was too long and that maybe it didn't go far enough. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2316.1600000000003s)]
*  Two thousand military families agree the Navy didn't go far enough and are suing the government. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2322.4s)]
*  The Tragers and Dietzes have joined the lawsuit, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2328.48s)]
*  alleging they were harmed by negligence at Red Hill. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2331.76s)]
*  Are you angry that it happened or are you angry at what happened after? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2335.44s)]
*  It's a little bit of anger, but it's also this feeling of betrayal. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2340.2400000000002s)]
*  What do you mean betrayal? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2344.0s)]
*  So my husband has been in for almost 18 years. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2345.1200000000003s)]
*  We have moved our family cross country, cross oceans. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2349.1200000000003s)]
*  We gave so much of our life to the Navy for them to ignore warnings [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2352.88s)]
*  and then we were directly and blatantly lied to about it. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2357.6s)]
*  Navy leadership has apologized for the spill but has not said that the contaminated water [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2362.4s)]
*  is the cause of the ongoing illnesses. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2367.84s)]
*  The Navy did set up a clinic on base to collect data [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2370.88s)]
*  and treat anyone who believes they have health issues related to the tainted water. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2374.2400000000002s)]
*  What happens in five or ten or fifteen years? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2379.52s)]
*  Will those services still be available to these families? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2382.88s)]
*  That is part of why we are making sure that we're collecting that information [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2387.52s)]
*  to inform future actions and what the requirements are for those types of needs and care. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2393.28s)]
*  That doesn't sound like a guarantee of care in the future. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2399.92s)]
*  I want to be careful because I don't do the health care part of things [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2404.56s)]
*  and so I don't want to speak outside of where I have any authority or decision. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2408.24s)]
*  So we followed up with the Defense Department which told us it's reviewing the question [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2415.52s)]
*  of long-term health care for military families including more than 3,100 children. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2420.24s)]
*  Two years after the spill some residents have reported water with a smell or sheen. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2427.3599999999997s)]
*  The Navy is conducting daily tests at Pearl Harbor and says it is confident there is no [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2432.4799999999996s)]
*  fuel in the tap water. Rachelle Dietz is still using bottled water. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2437.84s)]
*  The lawsuit she joined with Brittany Traeger and the other military families [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2443.92s)]
*  is scheduled to go to trial tomorrow. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2448.32s)]
*  What is the remedy that you want? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2451.28s)]
*  In our family it's restoring my faith in our nation. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2454.1600000000003s)]
*  That's a big thing to say. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2458.48s)]
*  There's a body of government that failed. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2460.32s)]
*  They contaminated our water. They lied to us. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2462.2400000000002s)]
*  They did not protect us and they did not intervene and accountability looks like [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2465.04s)]
*  a lifelong care plan for me, my family and the people affected [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2469.68s)]
*  and that will restore my faith in my nation. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2475.12s)]
*  Does Red Hills still pose a threat to Honolulu? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2483.04s)]
*  This facility was a disaster waiting to happen. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2486.32s)]
*  At 60minutesovertime.com [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2489.44s)]
*  Now the last minute of 60 minutes. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2495.52s)]
*  Tonight an update of a story we reported this past December. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2501.12s)]
*  Chaos on campus. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2505.04s)]
*  In the wake of Hamas's bloody attack on Israeli civilians on October 7th last year [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2506.88s)]
*  and Israel's deadly bombardment and invasion of Gaza, some American college campuses erupted. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2512.48s)]
*  Charges of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia divided students and faculties alike. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2519.44s)]
*  We also found it didn't have to be that way. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2525.76s)]
*  Dartmouth encouraged conversation between supporters of Israel and supporters of Palestinian [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2529.68s)]
*  rights. Creative faculty members found ways to get the sides together, listen to each other [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2534.88s)]
*  and foster empathy. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2541.04s)]

*  American education might benefit from a few more Dartmouths. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2558.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm Bill Whittaker. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceB5WrkZCls&t=2564.24s)]
