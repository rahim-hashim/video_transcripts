# Reporting on Doomsday Scenarios | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4)
*  If you hear the term survivalist and it conjures images of militants and conspiracy theorists [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=0.0s)]
*  residing on the fringes and on compounds armed to the teeth, well, it's time to reset your [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=17.8s)]
*  doomsday clock. A worldwide community of preppers, those who stockpile goods and skill up for [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=23.04s)]
*  extreme catastrophes, is girding less for the end of days than for a disaster that calls [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=29.18s)]
*  for taking cover. A climate emergency, civil unrest, the possibility of a dirty bond. To [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=34.22s)]
*  say nothing of a global pandemic that suddenly shuts down the world. It was COVID that turned [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=40.18s)]
*  abstract apocalyptic scenarios into a reality. Modern preppers come at it from all angles [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=45.22s)]
*  and for all kinds of reasons. We went high and low talking to a few of the millions of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=51.42s)]
*  Americans who have joined the movement. We're literally going over the edge of the mountain [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=56.1s)]
*  right now. Bradley Garrett led our crew down a narrow trail near his home in Big Bear Lake, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=62.46s)]
*  California. When I moved here, one of my first off-road adventures was to figure out how to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=67.78s)]
*  get off this mountain without using the highway. And that's what we're doing right now. Where are [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=73.22s)]
*  we going? 10 miles an hour? Nine. A former university professor, Garrett wrote a book two [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  years ago about prepping, then became a convert himself. Our country doesn't have the infrastructure [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=85.62s)]
*  anymore to be able to deal with emergencies in a meaningful way. Behind the wheel of his hybrid [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=91.42s)]
*  four by four, he off-roads not for kicks, but to practice what preppers call bugging out, getting [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=96.54s)]
*  out of Dodge in the event of disaster, steering clear of the masses. We'll take these roads and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=105.84s)]
*  make sure that, you know, they're not washed out and we can still use them. Just give it a dry run. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=111.06s)]
*  Test running an escape route to the Mojave Desert sounds like overkill, until it doesn't. Consider [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=116.5s)]
*  this, days before our interview with Garrett, a wildfire forced him to put his bug out plan [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=124.14s)]
*  into action. And it climbed the ridge. I mean, literally right behind us. Literally to right [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=130.06s)]
*  here. My neighbor came and knocked on my door and he said, I think it's time to evacuate. There were [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=135.38s)]
*  helicopters pulling water from the lake and dumping it on the fire and we decided to go. So we passed [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=140.18s)]
*  up the dogs and the guinea pigs and we were out the door. How long it take you to pack 30 minutes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=145.46s)]
*  That fire is a couple of miles from our cabin. The wildfire burned more than a thousand acres, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  but didn't reach Garrett's cabin. We're packing up sleeve. Still, he used the close call to assess [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=155.38s)]
*  his readiness. How do you think you did? Pretty well. We fell down on documents, birth certificates, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=161.26000000000002s)]
*  credit cards. They were all over the house and I had stuff in filing cabinets. It was a mess. I [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=166.34s)]
*  went to get it down to 15, 15 minutes, 15 minutes out the door. Getting the dogs out is no problem. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  The guinea pigs are a little harder to wrangle. The act of gathering up animals in a natural [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=177.22s)]
*  disaster recalls the original prepper. Noah, of course, loaded them into an Ark. But in 2022 AD, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=182.82s)]
*  preppers still confront catastrophes of biblical proportions as varied as they are frequent. In the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=190.1s)]
*  last few months alone, Hurricane Ian showed us the wrath of nature. While Vladimir Putin showed us [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=197.04s)]
*  the wrath of man issuing a warning. He might use nuclear weapons. If and when disaster strikes FEMA, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=203.68s)]
*  the overburdened federal agency charged with leading the responses has warned Americans they [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=210.44s)]
*  should be ready to go it alone for several days. John Ramey is prepared to go it alone for two [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=216.44s)]
*  years. Ramey started his career in Silicon Valley and was an innovation advisor to the Obama [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=222.4s)]
*  administration. From his home in Colorado, he publishes a roundup of threats and how to prep [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=227.88s)]
*  for them. Best practices and bug out bag checklists. His website, The Prepared, is a leading voice for [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=232.96s)]
*  the measured segment of this growing community. We think about 15 million Americans are actively [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=240.0s)]
*  prepping right now. In terms of percentage of households, we are at or about to cross 10% of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=246.6s)]
*  all households. And just a few years ago, that was 2% or 3%. What happened to trigger this? More and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=252.92s)]
*  more people over the last decade that have accepted the reality of climate change and how that impacts [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=260.8s)]
*  the disasters and things that we go through almost every day now. What's happened with our economy [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=266.96s)]
*  since the global financial crisis? What's happened with political discourse and institutional [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=271.92s)]
*  failures? Broadly speaking, more and more people realizing that they are their own first responder. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=277.32s)]
*  This is a bug out bag. Part of Ramey's work entails reviewing the glut of supplies on the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=283.12s)]
*  multi-billion dollar prepping market. It's got unsafe drinking water. Here's a $25 filter. And [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  it will filter a hundred thousand gallons of water. Cell service down. No problem for that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=294.72s)]
*  old faithful ham radio. You at least have the ability to communicate. Ramey says the uptick in [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=300.44s)]
*  prepping cuts across national divides, politics, economics, region. Is there a typical prepper? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=306.28s)]
*  Not anymore. There used to be. Across the country, there is a growing darkness, a belief that the end [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=313.32s)]
*  of days is near. This is Doomsday Preppers. In the past, the reality TV shows that would cover [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=320.44s)]
*  preppers. They'd find someone who had the most extreme fantastical concern, like fascist alien [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=328.08s)]
*  zombies arriving on an asteroid. That is so night and day from where we're at now. In the foothills [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=335.0s)]
*  of Tennessee's Smoky Mountains, we met Heidi Keller in her vegetable garden. A restaurant [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=341.52s)]
*  supply company worker by day, she lives alone and calls herself a homestead prepper, ready to hunker [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=346.52s)]
*  down or bug in in a crisis. You can put raw meat in here. She recently acquired the hottest item for [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=352.96s)]
*  preppers, a freeze dryer. That's a pound of ground beef. This is where I keep all of my canned goods. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  Inside her pantry, Keller has canned, freeze dried and stored enough food to get by for a year without [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=366.32s)]
*  leaving her property. Chicken, meat, roast beef. And it doubles as protection from surging food [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=372.64s)]
*  prices. After fires spread through nearby Gatlinburg during a 2016 drought, Keller says she wanted a [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=378.36s)]
*  backup. When the fires came and made me rethink, my gosh, I can't have everything in my house because [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=385.16s)]
*  if something does happen and there is a fire and my house burns, it can't be all in one location. So [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=390.72s)]
*  the long term storage things I have someplace else. Where is that? In a secure location. It's not here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=396.56s)]
*  Fort Knox? No. How far from here? Not far, within five miles. You give us more hints? Why would I do that? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=405.56s)]
*  You know, I'm not. As a rule, preppers don't like to reveal too much. You might say they also have trust [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=412.68s)]
*  issues with the country's infrastructure and the ability of its institutions to deliver in a crisis. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=419.28s)]
*  If there's some kind of catastrophe, to what extent do you trust the government? I'm not going to down [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=425.0s)]
*  the government. I mean, they do the best that they can, but pretty much the government's not going to take care of you, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=430.84s)]
*  not because they may not want to, but because there's too much going on. That's common sense. You're prepared to go it alone? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=435.47999999999996s)]
*  You have to be to some degree. My biggest concern for two years, it took me to get a wood stove. I didn't have [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  that and I'm all electric. So I was not prepared. And finally, when I got it was like, finally, I feel more [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=448.64s)]
*  comfortable now. I'm okay. If all it takes is a wood stove for Heidi Keller to feel comfortable when the sun rises on post-apocalyptic [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=455.96000000000004s)]
*  America, the money class will find comfort here. We drove to the belly of the country, central Kansas, flat as a countertop, hemmed [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=464.16s)]
*  by soybean and cornfields. Who'd you actually buy this from? Where we met Larry Hall, a former defense contractor turned, shall we say, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=472.92s)]
*  niche property developer. In 2008, he paid $300,000 for this decommissioned nuclear missile silo. He and investors put in $22 million [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=480.68s)]
*  to refashion it as a luxury bunker, the survival condo, considerable thickness for door to a residence inside the 16,000 pound doors, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  an apartment building, we're gonna go down to 14, except this one is jammed 15 stories into the ground, jail burning fireplace over [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=500.76s)]
*  there's room for 75 people. All but three of the 14 private units have been sold. This three bedroom with TV screens posing as windows [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=508.72s)]
*  goes for $2.4 million cash. Who are your clients? These are all self made people. We don't have any lottery winners or old money. We [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=518.4s)]
*  have retired doctors, professional people. Do they share a particular ideology? No, they don't. I know that there's independents and I [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=527.5600000000001s)]
*  know there's democrats and republicans. They got the whole mix here. But what they have in common is they all want to have a safe place for [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=537.36s)]
*  their family. We've got a 75 foot long saltwater pool. The end of the world as we know it, they'll feel fine sitting poolside unless they'd [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=544.04s)]
*  prefer to go rock climbing. No one was living here full time when we visited but Hall says the place was hopping at the onset of the pandemic. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=554.04s)]
*  The owners for the first time ever all came here at the same time. All of them. So 19 kids were here. It's the ball sales pitch reduces to three [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=562.16s)]
*  words. Peace of mind. This is just a common area. With dozens of strangers hold up together in a crisis. Here's our bar. He hired a psychologist to [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=571.16s)]
*  consult on design to avoid a subterranean version of Lord of the Flies. I did notice what looked like a jail cell. We do have a jail cell. That's [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  because we also have a bar and a lounge. And if you have a bad day or you drink too much, you might get an adult time out. Five different power [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=589.36s)]
*  sources keep it all humming. There's a five year supply of stored food and hydroponics to grow more. The survival condo also employs door men, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  that is armed guards at the gate. To what extent are you worried this place could be overrun during an actual crisis? This place was engineered to [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=606.6s)]
*  withstand a 20 kiloton nuclear warhead detonated within a half mile. You know, you can rant and rave and throw smoke bombs and molotov cocktails and [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=615.52s)]
*  you're going to scratch by paint. Paul is converting another silo half an hour away. Most bunkers worldwide are not fortified luxuries. We get a [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  vivid demonstration of their practicality as Ukrainians take cover. In Australia, this man made news when he emerged unscathed from his backyard bunker [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=636.4s)]
*  after a deadly bushfire. Here in the US, one personal bunker manufacturer told us he takes a new order every other day. What do you make of the spike in [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=645.92s)]
*  The vast majority of people should never get to the point of having a bunker. And in fact, I really dislike the bunker narratives because it takes away from the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=656.44s)]
*  conversation that we should be having, which is how do we make our existing homes and our existing communities more resilient rather than, and I'm going to quit society and go live in a [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=667.0s)]
*  decommissioned missile silo. You say you would never build a bunker. Why not? You can only stockpile so much in your bunker. I can only withstand so much time in it. I would be desperate to peek out and see what's happening outside. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=678.32s)]
*  Bradley Garrett won't bunker down, but he has double down on bugging out. He keeps the second truck, this 1972 GMC in his yard in case the lights go out for good, taking out electronics and turning his hybrid escape vehicle into the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=691.4000000000001s)]
*  equivalent of an expensive brick. The specter of massive power grid failure, the result of a nuclear attack or solar storm, preoccupies many Preppers. The current estimates from the government is that it would take two years to rebuild the grid. Two years? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=706.48s)]
*  The wires that goes down for five minutes and everybody panics. Exactly. And Preppers say that it's 72 hours to animal. Meaning what? Meaning that it takes about three days for people to totally lose it. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=721.4000000000001s)]
*  Preppers call this the S H T F scenario, the proverbial S hitting the fan, a breakdown of social norms. John Ramey says, don't panic, just get prepping. If you have two weeks worth of food and water in your home, a radio, some basic supplies, that alone, that little bit of effort and cost covers you for the vast majority of scenarios. That's that minimum threshold that everyone should aspire to. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=732.56s)]
*  As more Americans stock up, bracing for the worst while still intent on surviving it, we may be approaching the day when Prepper isn't a loaded word. Until then, is there a preferred term now? The one that I prefer that's popping up is do more optimist. Sounds like an oxymoron. This is someone that that recognizes that disaster is inevitable, but they're optimistic that they're going to be able to make their way through them. They'll concede the catastrophe, but they'll be okay. Yeah, you have to live with hope. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=760.68s)]
*  You know, if if you don't have hope about the future, there's no point in preparing for it. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=791.16s)]
*  We're going to take you on a journey to the end of the earth to show you a place that might someday save humankind. It's a bank built to last 10,000 years, but it's not money or gold that's on deposit. Currencies rise and fall with civilizations. We were there last month when the world's most important assets were sold. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=795.72s)]
*  The world's most important assets were made safe from climate change and nuclear war locked deep inside the doomsday vault. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=826.24s)]
*  Head toward the top of the planet over the freezing Arctic Ocean, and you'll find a collection of ice covered islands called Svalbard, Norwegian for cold coast. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=835.2s)]
*  They're due north of Europe administered by Norway and among the last bits of land before the North Pole. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=847.1600000000001s)]
*  Down on the water is the northernmost town in the world. Long year been with about 2000 people, but polar bears outnumber the people and reindeer outnumber everything. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=854.96s)]
*  It's an otherworldly place, a twilight zone where sometimes the sun never rises and the moon never sets in the dead of winter. It was the last stop in the 30 year journey of American scientist Carrie Fowler. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=866.96s)]
*  It's a long way from the farm in Tennessee. It's a world away. Did you ever worry that it wouldn't get this far? I was worrying all the time, I think. But here we are. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=883.36s)]
*  From the outside, it looks like a concrete wedge pounded into a mountain. Walk through the door and cross from a hostile wasteland into a safe house for humanity. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=894.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, I've got to say it looks like a doomsday vault. It probably is one. At least we think if there are any big problems on the outside, this is going to survive. This was clearly built to last. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=905.04s)]
*  We built it to last as long as we could imagine. I don't know what was in the minds of the people who built the pyramids. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=917.68s)]
*  Maybe they were building to last forever too. But I can't think of anything that's been built in our lifetime that's been built with this kind of time horizon. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=925.68s)]
*  And all these pipes over our heads? That's the refrigeration units. The refrigeration? Yeah. We're 700 miles from the North Pole and you're air conditioning this place? We're going to freeze it even further. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=933.48s)]
*  Freeze it colder than the permafrost so that if the earth warms and the power goes out, the vault will stay frozen for another 25 years. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=945.4s)]
*  200, 100. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=955.3199999999999s)]
*  The treasures that the vault was built to house approached an airstrip at the base of the mountain nearby. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=958.3199999999999s)]
*  What's in these boxes took 10,000 years to develop and 70 years to collect. Now they were loaded for the last mile to Fowler's frozen Fort Knox. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  This is the coldest place in the mountain. We wanted to take advantage of the naturally frozen temperatures down here and we wanted absolutely the coldest spot we could find. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=982.24s)]
*  It is pretty cold down here. It's cold. It's getting colder actually. These are airlock doors. It keeps the cold air in. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=990.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=999.24s)]
*  It's pretty big. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1002.24s)]
*  So the foundation of humanity ends up here. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1004.24s)]
*  It's about 30 yards long. It's about 10 yards wide and 5 yards high. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1007.16s)]
*  Inside the boxes that came off the plane are millions of silver envelopes. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1013.16s)]
*  Show me what's inside. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1018.16s)]
*  Okay. We'll take a look at these two. They're going to be sealed in the boxes but here's one sample. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1019.16s)]
*  What are they? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1027.16s)]
*  Well these are chickpeas or garbanzos. This is a crop you ought to know. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1028.16s)]
*  Wheat? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1035.16s)]
*  Very good. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1037.0800000000002s)]
*  So what's in all these envelopes is? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1038.0800000000002s)]
*  Seeds. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1040.0800000000002s)]
*  This is a giant vault built in the Arctic just to house seeds. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1041.0800000000002s)]
*  That's right. It's a seed bank. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1045.0800000000002s)]
*  If you could clear away the ice you'd see that officially the bank is called the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1048.0800000000002s)]
*  It's built to warehouse backup copies of all the world's crops. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1056.0800000000002s)]
*  One and a half billion seeds. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1061.0s)]
*  Everything from California sunflowers to ancient Chinese rice. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1064.0s)]
*  If an asteroid strikes the earth, seeds to restart agriculture would come from here. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1069.0s)]
*  But science fiction aside, the main purpose is to protect against a doomsday that is unfolding right now. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1075.0s)]
*  Because the plants we've been eating for 10,000 years are going extinct. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1083.0s)]
*  If you ask somebody how many kinds of apples are there, they're going to say well there's red, there's green, there's yellow, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1088.92s)]
*  there's Macintosh, there's Golden Delicious. They're going to give you an answer like that. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1095.92s)]
*  Maybe 25 I would guess. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1099.92s)]
*  Good guess. But in fact in the 1800s in the United States people were growing 7,100 named varieties of apples. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1101.92s)]
*  7,100 different varieties of apples. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1112.92s)]
*  We've lost about 6,800 of those. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1117.8400000000001s)]
*  So the extinction rate for apple varieties in the United States is about 86 percent. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1120.8400000000001s)]
*  That pattern exists in all crops. Estimates are that every day one crop strain disappears. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1127.8400000000001s)]
*  And here's why. Seeds used to be passed down through families. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1134.8400000000001s)]
*  But today farmers are planting mass produced industrial seeds. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1138.8400000000001s)]
*  The upside is more food, but the downside is that the family variety goes extinct. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1144.76s)]
*  To understand the danger, we visited a U.S. government storehouse in Idaho, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1150.76s)]
*  where Mike Bonman watches over America's collection of wheat seeds. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1155.76s)]
*  Well we have in this room more than 50,000 different what we call accessions or collections of wheat from around the world. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1160.76s)]
*  50,000 different kinds of wheat? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1168.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1170.76s)]
*  I didn't know there were that many. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1171.76s)]
*  I think most people would be surprised. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1173.68s)]
*  Most countries collect seeds in banks for safekeeping. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1175.68s)]
*  And for 110 years the U.S. Department of Agriculture has sent scientists called plant explorers to collect the seeds in these envelopes. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1178.68s)]
*  If there's an Indiana Jones of plant explorers, his name was Jack Harlan, who made one of his greatest finds in the 1940s. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1188.68s)]
*  This is P.I. 1783-83. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1197.68s)]
*  This was a wild variety of wheat growing in Turkey. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1202.6000000000001s)]
*  An old farmer variety that had probably been growing there for thousands of years. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1205.6000000000001s)]
*  In the field it looked dreadful. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1209.6000000000001s)]
*  Harlan wrote in his journal it was hopelessly useless. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1211.6000000000001s)]
*  Useless for food, but as it turned out, inside these seeds is a superhero for fighting wheat disease. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1214.6000000000001s)]
*  Today, the genes of humble P.I. 1783-83 are a foundation of agriculture, bred into much of the bread we eat. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1223.52s)]
*  That's why you have to collect everything. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1233.52s)]
*  Because just by looking at the material in a farmer's field, you might say that one's no good, let's don't collect it. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1235.52s)]
*  But you can't anticipate what value that might have. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1242.52s)]
*  There may be genes in that material that are going to be of immense value in the future. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1246.52s)]
*  This is an example of a rust on a small grain. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1252.44s)]
*  In this case it's oats. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1255.44s)]
*  And in each pustule there are thousands and thousands of spores that are dispersed through the air and can infect other plants. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1256.44s)]
*  In the past, plant diseases like this cause mass starvation. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1263.44s)]
*  Think of the Irish potato famine. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1267.44s)]
*  But today, scientists prevent famines by going through tens of thousands of plants looking for genes to fight disease or drought or any other problem. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1269.44s)]
*  Turns out, some of the rarest and most valuable seeds come from some of the most unstable places. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1281.3600000000001s)]
*  There was an important seed bank in Afghanistan. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1288.3600000000001s)]
*  That's right. It's been destroyed. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1291.3600000000001s)]
*  In the chaos following the fighting there, it was looted and destroyed. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1293.3600000000001s)]
*  The Afghan seeds were thrown away because the looters wanted the glass jars they were kept in. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1298.3600000000001s)]
*  A major rock seed collection was lost in that war. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1306.28s)]
*  And in the Philippines, a typhoon washed away part of an important rice bank. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1309.28s)]
*  Doomsday doesn't have to come in the form of an asteroid. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1314.28s)]
*  Doomsday can come in the form of an equipment failure or a mismanagement, just human mismanagement, or a lack of funding, or a typhoon, or something like that. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1318.28s)]
*  And those kinds of things are happening all the time. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1328.28s)]
*  And once that crop is lost? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1331.28s)]
*  It's lost. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1333.28s)]
*  If it's lost again, and any kind of characteristic that it might have had is gone, it's off the artist's palette. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1335.2s)]
*  It's a color that we can't use anymore. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1340.2s)]
*  It may have the disease or pest resistance that we absolutely need to have to have a viable crop in the future. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1343.2s)]
*  Gone. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1350.2s)]
*  Fowler runs the Global Crop Diversity Trust, set up by the United Nations and Biodiversity International. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1351.2s)]
*  His safe house cost $9 million. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1359.2s)]
*  Norway paid for construction, Bill Gates paid for the shipping, and seeds from nearly every nation are locked inside. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1362.1200000000001s)]
*  Svalbard may seem a strange place to build an ark for plants. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1373.1200000000001s)]
*  We went exploring by the only practical way to get around. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1379.1200000000001s)]
*  The islands are a white desert, barren and chilled to 30 below zero. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1383.1200000000001s)]
*  We're just above 78 degrees north latitude, and the North Pole is just off this way, about 700 miles. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1391.04s)]
*  This is about all the light that you get during this time of year. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1399.04s)]
*  The sun never comes up over the horizon in the wintertime. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1402.04s)]
*  It's ironic that the world's agricultural heritage is being stored in a place with no agriculture at all. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1406.04s)]
*  They don't even have trees on Svalbard. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1414.04s)]
*  But these mountains are just the place to save the resources of life itself, remote from nuclear war, from storms and rising seas. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1417.96s)]
*  These resources stand between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1427.96s)]
*  And we now have, I think, kind of a perfect storm hitting agriculture. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1433.96s)]
*  That perfect storm is crop extinction, population growth and global warming. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1439.96s)]
*  At the University of Washington, Professor David Battisti has calculated that in a hundred years, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1445.88s)]
*  farmers will face temperatures unlike any in human history, temperatures more like millions of years ago. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1451.88s)]
*  What were conditions like then? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1459.88s)]
*  Well, let me describe it this way. You have crocodiles in Ellesmere Island, which is in the edge of the Arctic. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1461.88s)]
*  You have palm trees in Wyoming. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1466.88s)]
*  Battisti's data come from the Nobel Prize-winning climate research of the UN. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1470.8000000000002s)]
*  His work is funded by the National Science Foundation. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1474.8000000000002s)]
*  Battisti projects that the droughts of the past will pale in comparison to what he believes is coming. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1478.8000000000002s)]
*  If you think about the Dust Bowl in the U.S., you think about, well, there was a decade where you had, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1486.8000000000002s)]
*  on the average, maybe 5% reduction in precipitation for the growing season, Southern California, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1494.72s)]
*  the Caribbean, Southern Europe, Northern Africa, Central Asia. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1500.72s)]
*  All of these places, a hundred years now, will typically experience, on average, 20 to 30% reduction in precipitation. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1506.72s)]
*  So that's five times the Dust Bowl. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1514.72s)]
*  Whether it's a dry climate, a new virus, or infestation, the genes to stop a famine may be in one of these boxes. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1518.64s)]
*  When the last of the seeds descends the tunnel, the lights will go out, the vault will be locked, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1526.64s)]

*  If worse comes to worse, this does save the world, but it also has a more mundane feature to it, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1541.5600000000002s)]
*  which is it helps us every day in feeding people. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1547.5600000000002s)]
*  In what year will the human population grow too large for the Earth to sustain? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1559.5600000000002s)]
*  The answer is about 1970, according to research by the World Wildlife Fund. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1566.48s)]
*  In 1970, the planet's three and a half billion people were sustainable, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1572.48s)]
*  but on this New Year's Day, the population is eight billion. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1577.48s)]
*  Today, wild plants and animals are running out of places to live. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1582.48s)]
*  The scientists you're about to meet say the Earth is suffering a crisis of mass extinction [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1588.48s)]
*  that's been so unseen since the dinosaurs. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1595.4s)]
*  We're going to show you a possible solution, but first, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1597.4s)]
*  have a look at how humanity is already suffering from the vanishing wild. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1600.4s)]
*  In Washington state, the Salish Sea helped feed the world. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1608.4s)]
*  With this weather and the way things feel once I get out here, it's time to be fishing. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1615.4s)]
*  That's what it feels like. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1620.4s)]
*  National fisherman Dana Wilson supported a family on the Salish Sea's legendary wealth of salmon. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1622.3200000000002s)]
*  He remembers propellers churning the water off Blaine, Washington, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1628.3200000000002s)]
*  and cranes straining for the state's $200 million annual catch. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1632.3200000000002s)]
*  That used to be a buying station. They're gone now. They don't buy anymore. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1638.3200000000002s)]
*  So that building over there used to buy salmon. They don't buy salmon anymore. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1642.3200000000002s)]
*  It's just not here. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1649.24s)]
*  In 1991, one salmon species was endangered. Today, 14 salmon populations are foundering. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1651.24s)]
*  They've been crowded out of rivers by habitat destruction, warming, and pollution. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1659.24s)]
*  Dana Wilson used to fish all summer. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1665.24s)]
*  Today, a conservation authority grants rare, fleeting permission to throw a net. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1669.24s)]
*  There was a season. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1675.24s)]
*  Now there's a day. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1678.16s)]
*  There's a day. Sometimes it's hours. Sometimes you might get 12 hours, 16 hours. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1679.16s)]
*  That's what we're down to. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1685.16s)]
*  Here, the vanishing wilds scuttled a way of life that began with native tribes a thousand years ago. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1688.16s)]
*  I don't remember anybody doing anything other than salmon fishing. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1695.16s)]
*  Fisherman Armando Briones is a member of the Lummi tribe, which calls itself People of the Salmon. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1698.16s)]
*  He didn't imagine the rich harvest would end with his five fishing boats. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1707.0800000000002s)]
*  All of a sudden you're trying to figure out, well, how am I going to make that paycheck for my family? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1711.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, for me, it was like, well, I have a backup for a backup for a backup for a backup. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1715.0800000000002s)]
*  Briones' backups include his new food truck, switching to crab fishing, and consulting on cannabis farms. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1719.0800000000002s)]
*  His scramble to adapt is being repeated around the world. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1727.0800000000002s)]
*  A World Wildlife Fund study says that in the past 50 years, the abundance of global wildlife has collapsed 69 percent, mostly for the same reason. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1734.0s)]
*  Too many people, too much consumption, and growth mania. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1745.0s)]
*  At the age of 90, biologist Paul Ehrlich may have lived long enough to see some of his dire prophecies come true. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1750.0s)]
*  You seem to be saying that humanity is not sustainable. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1758.0s)]
*  Humanity is not sustainable. To maintain our lifestyle, yours and mine, basically for the entire planet, you'd need five more Earths, not clear where they're going to come from. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1761.92s)]
*  Just in terms of the resources that would be required? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1771.92s)]
*  Resources that would be required, the systems that support our lives, which of course are the biodiversity that we're wiping out. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1774.92s)]
*  Humanity is very busily sitting on a limb that we're sawing off. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1784.92s)]
*  In 1968, Ehrlich, a biology professor at Stanford, became a doomsday celebrity with a bestseller forecasting the collapse of nature. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1790.8400000000001s)]
*  When the population bomb came out, you were described as an alarmist. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1800.8400000000001s)]
*  I was alarmed. I am still alarmed. All of my colleagues are alarmed. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1804.8400000000001s)]
*  The alarm Ehrlich sounded in 68 warned that overpopulation would trigger widespread famine. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1810.8400000000001s)]
*  He was wrong about that. The Green Revolution fed the world. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1818.76s)]
*  But he also wrote in 68 that heat from greenhouse gases would melt polar ice, and humanity would overwhelm the wild. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1822.76s)]
*  Today, humans have taken over 70% of the planet's land and 70% of the fresh water. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1831.76s)]
*  The rate of extinction is extraordinarily high now and getting higher all the time. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1840.76s)]
*  We know the rate of extinction is extraordinarily high because of a study of the fossil record by biologist Tony Barnofsky, Ehrlich's Stanford colleague. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1847.68s)]
*  The data are rock solid. I don't think you'll find a scientist that will say we're not in an extinction crisis. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1857.68s)]
*  Barnofsky's research suggests today's rate of extinction is up to 100 times faster than is typical in the nearly 4 billion year history of life. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1863.68s)]
*  These peaks represent the few times that life collapsed globally, and the last was the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1875.6000000000001s)]
*  There are five times in Earth's history where we had mass extinctions, and by mass extinctions I mean at least 75% three-quarters of the known species disappearing from the face of the Earth. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1884.6000000000001s)]
*  Now we're witnessing what a lot of people are calling the sixth mass extinction where the same thing could happen on our watch. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1900.52s)]
*  It's a horrific state of the planet when common species, the ubiquitous species that we're familiar with, are declining. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1909.52s)]
*  Tony Barnofsky's colleague in the study of extinction is his wife, biologist Liz Hadley, faculty director at Stanford's Jasper Ridge Research Preserve in California. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1919.44s)]
*  You know, I see it in my mind and it's a really sad state. If you spend any time in California, you know the loss of water. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1930.44s)]
*  The loss of water means that there are dead salmon you see in the river right before your eyes, but it also means the demise of those birds that rely on the salmon fishery. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1939.3600000000001s)]
*  Eagles. It means things like minks and otters that rely on fish. It means that our habitats that we're used to, the forests that, you know, 3,000 year old forests are going to be gone. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1949.3600000000001s)]
*  So it means silence and it means some very catastrophic events because it's happening so quickly. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1963.28s)]
*  It means you look out your window and three quarters of what you think ought to be there is no longer there. That's what mass extinction looks like. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1970.28s)]
*  What we see just in California is, you know, the loss of our iconic state symbols. We have no more grizzly bears in California. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1980.28s)]
*  The only grizzly bears in California are on the state flag? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1989.2s)]
*  That's our state mammal and they're not here anymore. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1992.2s)]
*  Is it too much to say that we're killing the planet? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1996.2s)]
*  No. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=1999.2s)]
*  I would say it's too much to say that we're killing the planet because the planet's going to be fine. What we're doing is we're killing our way of life. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2000.2s)]
*  The worst of the killing is in Latin America, where the World Wildlife Fund study says the abundance of wildlife has fallen 94% since 1970. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2011.1200000000001s)]
*  But it was also in Latin America that we found the possibility of hope. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2024.1200000000001s)]
*  Mexican ecologist Gerardo Sevalios is one of the world's leading scientists on extinction. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2031.1200000000001s)]
*  He told us the only solution is to save the one-third of the earth that remains wild. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2038.04s)]
*  To prove it, he's running a 3,000-square-mile experiment. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2045.04s)]
*  In the Colicmo Biosphere Reserve near Guatemala, he is paying family farmers to stop cutting the forest. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2050.04s)]
*  We're going to pay each family a certain amount of money that is more than you will get cutting down the forest if you protect it. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2058.04s)]
*  How much are you paying out every year? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2067.96s)]
*  For instance, each family here will get around $1,000. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2070.96s)]
*  More than enough here to make up for lost farmland. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2075.96s)]
*  In total, the payouts come to $1.5 million a year, or about $2,000 per square mile. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2079.96s)]
*  The TAB is paid through the charity of wealthy donors. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2087.96s)]
*  The payment to protect what is left is really small. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2092.88s)]
*  The payoff on that investment is being collected on Sevalios' jungle cameras. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2097.88s)]
*  Thirty years ago, the jaguar was very nearly extinct in Mexico. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2102.88s)]
*  Now Sevalios says they've rebounded to about 600 in the reserve. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2108.88s)]
*  There are other places where there are reserves around the world where they've been able to increase the populations of certain species. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2113.88s)]
*  But I wonder, are all these little success stories enough to prevent mass extinction? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2122.8s)]
*  All the big success that we have in protecting forests and recovering animals like tigers in India, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2130.8s)]
*  jaguars in Mexico, elephants in Botswana and so on, are incredible, amazing successes. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2138.8s)]
*  But there are grains of sand in a beach. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2144.8s)]
*  To really make a big impact, we need to scale up this 10,000 times. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2149.7200000000003s)]
*  So they are important because they give us hope, but they are completely insufficient to cope with climate change. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2155.7200000000003s)]
*  So what would the world have to do? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2162.7200000000003s)]
*  What we would have to do is to really understand that the climate change and species extinction is a threat to humanity. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2165.7200000000003s)]
*  And then put all the machinery of society, political, economic and social, towards finding solutions to the problems. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2174.64s)]
*  Finding solutions to the problems was the goal two weeks ago at the UN Biodiversity Conference, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2186.64s)]
*  where nations agreed to conservation targets. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2193.64s)]
*  But at the same meeting in 2010, those nations agreed to limit the destruction of the earth by 2020, and not one of those goals was met. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2197.56s)]
*  This despite thousands of studies, including the continuing research of Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2207.56s)]
*  You know that there is no political will to do any of the things that you're recommending. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2215.56s)]
*  I know there's no political will to do any of the things that I'm concerned with, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2223.48s)]
*  which is exactly why I and the vast majority of my colleagues think we've had it, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2228.48s)]
*  that the next few decades will be the end of the kind of civilization we're used to. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2235.48s)]
*  In the 50 years since Ehrlich's population bomb, humanity's feasting on resources has tripled. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2241.48s)]
*  We're already consuming 175% of what the earth can regenerate. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2250.4s)]
*  And consider, half of humanity, about 4 billion, live on less than $10 a day. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2255.4s)]
*  They aspire to cars, air conditioning and a rich diet. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2262.4s)]
*  But they won't be fed by the fishermen of Washington's Salish Sea, including Armando Briones. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2267.4s)]
*  The tribe has been fishing salmon here for hundreds of years. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2274.4s)]
*  And your generation is seeing the end of that. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2279.32s)]
*  It's getting harder and harder. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2282.32s)]
*  I hate to say, I don't want to say it's the end of it. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2285.32s)]
*  Why do you feel so emotionally attached to this? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2291.32s)]
*  It's everything we know. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2297.32s)]
*  I'm fortunate enough to know where I know a lot of different things. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2301.32s)]
*  I've done a lot of different things in my life. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2304.32s)]
*  I've gotten good at evolving and changing. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2309.32s)]
*  But not everybody here is built like that. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2315.32s)]
*  And to some of us, this is what they know. This is all they know. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2317.32s)]
*  The five mass extinctions of the ancient past were caused by natural calamities, volcanoes and an asteroid. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2323.32s)]
*  Today, if the science is right, humanity may have to survive a sixth mass extinction in a world of its own making. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2333.2400000000002s)]
*  In January, Uganda declared an end to the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus that alarmed scientists in 2022. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2352.2400000000002s)]
*  No cases were discovered outside Africa, but Ebola remains among the deadliest of pathogens capable of jumping from wild animals to humans, just as COVID-19 likely did. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2360.16s)]
*  It's called spillover. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2372.16s)]
*  Disease detectives warn the threat of spillover has never been higher as urban populations grow and come into contact with wild animals and their viruses. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2374.16s)]
*  Since 2009, American scientists have discovered more than 900 new viruses. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2385.08s)]
*  As we first reported in October, now the U.S. government is doubling down, sending virus hunters to global hotspots to find the next deadly virus before it finds us. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2391.08s)]
*  We joined a team from the University of California Davis and their Ugandan partners in the rugged, impenetrable forest on the search for pathogen X. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2404.0s)]
*  We landed in Kahihi, a speck of a town in southwest Uganda. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2417.0s)]
*  As we headed off to the impenetrable forest, we soon saw how it got its name. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2423.0s)]
*  It's so thick with trees, vines and roots that Ugandans call it the place of darkness. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2429.92s)]
*  As our 4x4s bumped and swerved along deeply-rudded tracks, we passed tea farmers, loggers, villagers, all living on the edge of the forest, where the risk of infectious disease spilling over from animals is highest. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2437.92s)]
*  Wildlife epidemiologist Christine Johnson handicapped the stakes. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2453.92s)]
*  How would you rate the odds of another pandemic? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2459.92s)]
*  I would say another pandemic is guaranteed. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2463.92s)]
*  Guaranteed? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2466.92s)]
*  It's not a matter of if but when. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2467.92s)]
*  That's why we're so committed to preparation. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2469.92s)]
*  Johnson leads the UC Davis team and has been hunting viruses around the globe for decades. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2473.92s)]
*  We were headed to an abandoned mine shaft to look for bats. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2479.92s)]
*  Johnson told us bats are prime suspects for spillover. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2483.92s)]
*  They harbor more viruses lethal to humans than any other mammal. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2488.84s)]
*  New bat species and new viruses are still being discovered. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2492.84s)]
*  It seems like a really daunting task for you to find pathogen X before it finds us. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2497.84s)]
*  It's definitely achievable. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2503.84s)]
*  It is achievable. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2505.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2506.84s)]
*  It's all here right now, right? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2507.84s)]
*  It's not like we're exploring outer space. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2509.84s)]
*  All of these viruses and all of the wildlife are right here on our planet. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2513.76s)]
*  The bats would start flying at dusk. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2519.76s)]
*  We waited as the UC Davis team and their Ugandan partners hung a fine mesh net across the entrance of the cave. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2522.76s)]
*  We wore masks and goggles to protect ourselves against any early risers. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2530.76s)]
*  Benard Sebade, one of Uganda's top wildlife vets, told us this area used to be all forest. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2536.6800000000003s)]
*  Now villagers had planted a cornfield right up to the mouth of the bat cave, increasing the risk of spillover. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2544.6800000000003s)]
*  As if on cue, we watched women carrying water cut through the cornfield while schoolchildren ran home. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2552.6800000000003s)]
*  The transfer between bats and humans, it's much more likely when you've got people living so close. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2562.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2569.6s)]
*  The population has grown. People have moved into areas they never occupied before. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2570.6s)]
*  That shrinkage of the buffer, the habitat between people and wildlife has become so narrow. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2575.6s)]
*  So that increases the contact. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2582.6s)]
*  So you're talking about people who are now living right on the edge of the impenetrable parts. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2586.52s)]
*  Exactly. Governments cannot stop people from moving in some of these areas because they have nowhere else to go. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2592.52s)]
*  Bats are known to carry coronaviruses, the same virus family that spawned COVID-19, as well as lethal Ebola viruses. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2597.52s)]
*  So we had to dress head to toe in protective gear. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2608.52s)]
*  Once the hazmat suit was on, we added two sets of gloves, a mask and a face shield to guard against flying guano and other toxins. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2613.44s)]
*  Once we begin, I must assume everything is contaminated. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2623.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2626.44s)]
*  The impenetrable forest was soon pitch black, and we had only the light from our headlamps to guide us. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2627.44s)]
*  Soon they'd trapped a large Egyptian fruit bat. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2636.36s)]
*  Wildlife vet Bernard Zebedee gently disentangled it and put it in a fabric sack. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2639.36s)]
*  We followed him back to the makeshift lab, glowing in the dark. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2646.36s)]
*  The bat sacs quivered in the ghostly light. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2651.36s)]
*  It felt like we were on the set of a sci-fi movie. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2654.36s)]
*  Oh, he's a big guy. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2658.36s)]
*  Up close, the bats did little to dispel their fearsome reputations. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2659.36s)]
*  We watched as the fruit bat grew agitated, trying to escape. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2665.28s)]
*  The scientist held its nose to a test tube filled with a mild anesthetic. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2669.28s)]
*  Finally, the bat succumbed. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2675.28s)]
*  Epidemiologist Christine Johnson told us the bat would be swabbed for a suite of viruses. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2677.28s)]
*  Does this hurt the bat at all? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2684.28s)]
*  No, it doesn't hurt the bat. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2686.28s)]
*  We get the right size swab so that we're just doing a real sample. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2687.28s)]
*  It might be a little uncomfortable. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2691.28s)]
*  The bat's wings were examined for parasites and ticks that might also have pathogens. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2694.2000000000003s)]
*  All the samples would be sent to a lab for DNA sequencing. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2700.2000000000003s)]
*  Johnson told us a virus's genetic code can help identify which might cross to humans. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2704.2000000000003s)]
*  After the tests were done, the bats were released, groggy but unharmed. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2710.2000000000003s)]
*  The next day, we joined Tierra Smiley-Evans, a UC Davis epidemiologist and wildlife vet. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2717.12s)]
*  We were looking for monkeys and baboons. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2724.12s)]
*  Like bats, primates carry many viruses that have leapt to people. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2728.12s)]
*  Smiley-Evans told us catching an outbreak early at the point of spillover is vital to containing it. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2733.12s)]
*  It sounds like there's no shortage of viruses that can infect humans that come out of the forest. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2740.12s)]
*  There are probably more pathogens that we don't know about than ones that we do know about. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2746.04s)]
*  We need to gather more information and more intelligence about what may be out there and able to spill over before it does. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2751.04s)]
*  So they come right down to the hospital? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2758.04s)]
*  Yeah, in the back. It's up right against the forest. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2760.04s)]
*  We met her at the Bwindi Community Hospital on the edge of the forest. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2764.04s)]
*  It's really something. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2768.04s)]
*  It's so close, we saw baboons casually strolling on the hospital grounds. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2769.04s)]
*  Sometimes getting into patients' rooms. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2774.96s)]
*  Whenever you're creating a new opportunity for humans to come in contact with wildlife populations that they were never in contact with before, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2777.96s)]
*  you're creating a brand new situation. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2786.96s)]
*  So as human populations grow, that's pushing us into areas we've never been before. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2789.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2794.96s)]
*  Putting us into contact with animals we've never been in contact with before. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2795.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2798.96s)]
*  To find out what viruses the baboons were carrying, Smiley Evans pioneered a simple but groundbreaking method to collect saliva samples. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2800.88s)]
*  The stealth banana. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2809.88s)]
*  Tied to a string, the banana is tossed to the curious baboons. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2811.88s)]
*  But hidden inside is an oral swab, coated in something sweet that the baboons love to chew. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2818.88s)]
*  Smiley Evans and Ugandan wildlife vet Ukamba Nelson had prepared the bananas earlier in the day. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2825.8s)]
*  So we have tried strawberry jam, we've tried mango juice. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2832.8s)]
*  Have you found they like one more than the other? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2835.8s)]
*  The difference is that sometimes they'll chew on that swab for longer periods of time with a different attractant versus another, and that's what we really want. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2837.8s)]
*  It's like bubble gum for primates. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2847.7200000000003s)]
*  When the sweet is gone, the baboons throw the swab away, leaving behind plenty of saliva that can be decoded for viruses. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2849.7200000000003s)]
*  But family politics can sometimes get in the way. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2858.7200000000003s)]
*  Meet the big daddy of this troop. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2861.7200000000003s)]
*  He wasn't about to let anyone else get even a mouthful. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2864.7200000000003s)]
*  Mom hauled the babies out of the way until finally the coast was clear. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2868.7200000000003s)]
*  By then all that was left were soggy leftovers. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2874.64s)]
*  Wildlife vet Ukamba Nelson told us it was worth the wait. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2877.64s)]
*  It was rare to see babies venture this close. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2881.64s)]
*  So you got saliva samples from the babies yesterday? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2885.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2888.64s)]
*  That's unusual? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2889.64s)]
*  It's very unusual. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2890.64s)]
*  So what do you get from the babies that you don't get from the adults? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2891.64s)]
*  You never know. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2896.64s)]
*  I might find a particular disease in this age bracket, which might not be found in the juvenile or the females. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2897.64s)]
*  Sex, age, all that plays a lot in disease intelligence. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2904.56s)]
*  Disease intelligence that also includes training villagers to be on the lookout for any unusual fevers or flu-like symptoms. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2908.56s)]
*  Scientists can then match human illnesses to the animal viruses they've found in the same area. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2917.56s)]
*  Smiley Evans told us it was putting pieces of a puzzle together. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2923.56s)]
*  All the samples are tested in the same way for the same pathogens. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2928.56s)]
*  So the goal is that if we're sampling at the same time in the same area, we can start to connect the dots and understand when there's been transmission of a particular virus. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2933.48s)]
*  One of the most closely monitored species in the impenetrable forest are its star residents, the endangered mountain gorilla. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2943.48s)]
*  Nearly half the world's remaining gorillas are here, 459 at last count. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2951.48s)]
*  They're always on the move. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2958.48s)]
*  So we set off to find them. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2962.56s)]
*  One ridge led to another. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2964.56s)]
*  Each steeper than the last. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2967.56s)]
*  The forest was so dense there was no sunlight and no gorillas. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2969.56s)]
*  Wildlife vet Bernard Zebedee assured us we were on the right path. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2975.56s)]
*  Are you seeing signs of the gorillas around here? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2980.56s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen some already. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2983.56s)]
*  Our porters breezed along unfazed. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2985.56s)]
*  We, not so much. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2988.56s)]
*  Then, hours after trekking, suddenly there they were. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2991.56s)]
*  We spotted a mother first high in the trees gorging on twigs. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=2996.56s)]
*  Soon we were surrounded by all 19 members of an extended family, including a massive silverback and another mother cradling her infant. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3001.56s)]
*  We had put on our masks not to protect ourselves, but to protect the gorillas from any infection we might be carrying. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3012.56s)]
*  Amy Bond is with Gorilla Doctors, an international conservation group. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3020.56s)]
*  She told us how they identify each gorilla. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3025.56s)]
*  Just like humans where we each have our own unique fingerprint that helps us be identifiable as an individual, gorillas have unique nose prints. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3029.56s)]
*  A nose print? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3037.56s)]
*  A nose print. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3038.56s)]
*  And that's what allows us to identify those individuals. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3039.56s)]
*  And so we go through and we make sure we get each individual in the group that we can do a visual assessment looking for signs of illness or injury. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3043.56s)]
*  Bond and wildlife vet Bernard Zebedee told us that gorillas are susceptible to many of the same pathogens that we are, and they can be an early harbinger of disease. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3050.56s)]
*  The gorillas are monitored daily for any warning signs. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3062.56s)]
*  When they're sick, it's very similar, right? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3066.56s)]
*  Running nose, coughing, sneezing. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3068.56s)]
*  They're not moving. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3070.56s)]
*  They don't want to eat. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3072.56s)]
*  If a gorilla is lying down, Zebedee told us, they'll assess if he's resting or if something else is preventing him from moving. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3073.56s)]
*  We spotted one young male on his own, but Amy Bond told us he was likely suffering from a problem of a different sort. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3082.56s)]
*  You can also sometimes tell which silverback is dominated by the number of females around him. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3090.56s)]
*  So this poor guy sitting over here, he's just out. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3096.56s)]
*  He's always second choice. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3100.56s)]
*  Aside from a case of wounded male pride, gorilla doctors Amy Bond told us this family appeared to be thriving. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3102.56s)]
*  But their future isn't guaranteed, and if theirs isn't, neither is ours. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3110.56s)]
*  Bond told us as spillover threats grow, it's impossible to separate human health from the health of the natural world. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3116.56s)]
*  As UC Davis scientists continue their work, the search for pathogen X is a search for what threatens the animals of the impenetrable forest as much as it threatens us. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aUFSOG9jI4&t=3124.56s)]
