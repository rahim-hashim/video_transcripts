# Hide and Seek; An American Down Under; Jeff Koons | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [September 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk)
*  A poet once described Cyprus as a golden green leaf thrown into the sea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=0.0s)]
*  The island, just 140 miles long, is wrapped in sandy beaches and a rich history. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=13.76s)]
*  These turquoise waters, according to legend, were the birthplace of Aphrodite. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=20.0s)]
*  But today, the playground of the gods has become a place to hide billions for sanctioned Russian oligarchs with ties to Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=24.96s)]
*  This football player wasn't just drafted into the NFL. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=33.6s)]
*  No, but at 6'11 he's the tallest player and only American currently playing professional Australian rules football. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=42.72s)]
*  A fast and fierce game that makes ours look like a quilting bee. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=52.56s)]
*  So who is this tall Texas transplant and how, in the name of Walton Matilda, did he become a star down under? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  That's our story tonight. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=63.36s)]
*  I believe the first piece was... [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=67.36s)]
*  Jeff Koons is one of the most prominent and polarizing art stars in the world. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=69.36s)]
*  His creations may look simple, but they can take decades to make and often push the boundaries of technology and sometimes taste. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=73.36s)]
*  Critics may scoff at times, but that's nothing new. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  Jeff Koons has been controversial since he first started showing his art more than 40 years ago. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=84.8s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=92.8s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=94.32s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=95.6s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonzi. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=96.8s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=98.24s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=99.44s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=100.8s)]
*  Those stories tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=102.24s)]
*  After Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. and its allies responded with sanctions targeting companies, oligarchs, and officials with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=110.96s)]
*  Headlines trumpeted the trophies of Russian oligarchs seized throughout Europe, yachts in Italy, villas in the south of France, and priceless art in Germany. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=124.8s)]
*  But those fixed assets are relatively easy to locate. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=134.4s)]
*  Finding the billions of dollars oligarchs have stashed around the world is proving to be more difficult. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  How do you hide that much money from an international community that says it's determined to find it? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=145.12s)]
*  The question led us to Cyprus, a tiny Mediterranean island at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=151.28s)]
*  As we first reported in January, the once bustling vacation spot is in the middle of an international game of hide and seek. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  A poet once described Cyprus as a golden green leaf thrown into the sea. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=168.88s)]
*  The island, just 140 miles long, is wrapped in sandy beaches and a rich history. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=174.32s)]
*  These turquoise waters, according to legend, were the birthplace of Aphrodite. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=180.16s)]
*  But today, the playground of the gods has become a play land for wealthy Russians. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=184.96s)]
*  We headed down the southern coast of the island to Limassol. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=192.32s)]
*  Before the ward was a favorite spot for Russians to thaw. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=195.84s)]
*  A three-hour flight from Moscow, Limassol's mix of designer shops, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=199.36s)]
*  fur stores, Cyrillic signs, and stores serving caviar earned it the nickname Moscow on the Med. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=203.76s)]
*  But Alexandra Atalides, a member of the Cyprus parliament, says after the fall of the Soviet Union, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=211.44s)]
*  the oligarchs who descended on the island weren't here for the beaches. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=217.52s)]
*  There are beautiful beaches in Spain, in Portugal, in Greece. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=221.6s)]
*  There are a lot of beautiful beaches. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=225.28s)]
*  I think that they found a fertile ground here that helped them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  How did the Russian oligarchs use Cyprus? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=233.6s)]
*  After 1989, when they stole the property of the Russian people [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  and they started to build their empires. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  And then maybe they were afraid that someday something will happen, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=243.6s)]
*  so they wanted their assets to be saved outside Russia. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=247.36s)]
*  So they were looking for tax havens and we had a very low tax rate at the time. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  They got a place to hide their assets. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=258.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=259.76s)]
*  Cyprus historically built a financial system to attract overseas wealth. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  Myra Martini is an analyst for Transparency International, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  a non-profit that tracks money laundering around the world. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=271.2s)]
*  She says for decades, if you were an oligarch or just a shady character looking to hide your rubles, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=274.72s)]
*  Cyprus was hard to beat. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=280.72s)]
*  It offers the secrecy and still security. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=282.72s)]
*  And that's what criminals and corrupt individuals are usually looking for. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=286.48s)]
*  What do you mean it offers secrecy? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=291.6s)]
*  So in Cyprus, for many years, you could open a bank account without having a lot of questions asked. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=294.16s)]
*  You can open a company without having a lot of questions asked, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  meaning you can put the money there without needing to tell who you are, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=303.76s)]
*  where the money comes from. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=308.0s)]
*  Cyprus became as famous for its opaque banking as its clear water. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=309.92s)]
*  Soon, like Sun Star of Taurus, foreign money started pouring into the island. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=314.8s)]
*  By 2012, the country of about a million residents had amassed bank deposits of nearly 72 billion euros. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  About 30 percent of those bank deposits came from Russian nationals. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  But in 2013, the tide turned. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=332.8s)]
*  The debt crisis in neighboring Greece threatened to sink the Cyprus economy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=335.6s)]
*  Lawmakers fearing the country would lose all that Russian capital [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=340.32000000000005s)]
*  pushed a scheme other countries had used to attract wealth, a citizenship by investment program. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  Here's how it worked. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=354.0s)]
*  Any foreigner who invested more than two million euros in the country, typically buying real estate, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  could get a Cypriot passport, a coveted possession because Cyprus is part of the European Union. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=360.8s)]
*  So the people who are buying the passport of Cyprus, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=367.12s)]
*  they were buying the European passport. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=370.64000000000004s)]
*  They were buying an open door to 27 countries. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  From 2013 to 2020, Cyprus issued almost 7,000 of those golden passports, nearly half to Russians. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=376.88000000000005s)]
*  Suddenly, the skyline of Limassol was injected with high-rise luxury apartments, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=386.24s)]
*  its port with megayachts, and its stores with uber-wealthy Russians. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=391.44s)]
*  You could see them walking around like princesses moving in the most expensive shops. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=396.48s)]
*  They have their business, they have their houses, they have luxury houses. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=401.52s)]
*  But in 2020, an undercover investigation by Al Jazeera [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=406.72s)]
*  revealed corruption in the passport program. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=410.8s)]
*  No passport date has come out. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=413.6s)]
*  Cyprus had illegally issued hundreds of golden passports, some to criminals and fugitives. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=417.36s)]
*  After protests and under pressure from the EU, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  the Cyprus government shuttered the program weeks later. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  But the passports were still out there. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=431.76000000000005s)]
*  When you give passports to people that later, we realize that they are criminals, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=434.72s)]
*  then you open the door of Europe to criminals. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=440.8s)]
*  The golden passports also opened the door of Europe to Russian elites. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=443.6s)]
*  60 Minutes has learned that at least a dozen of these now-sanctioned [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  Russian oligarchs were issued golden passports. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=452.88s)]
*  Among them, Igor Kiseyev, who owned a Russian arms factory, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=456.08000000000004s)]
*  billionaire Alexander Ponimarenko, who was the chairman of the board of Russia's biggest airport [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=460.64000000000004s)]
*  and who the U.S. government calls one of Putin's enablers, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=466.40000000000003s)]
*  and aluminum tycoon Oleg Deripaska, part of Putin's inner circle. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=470.08s)]
*  According to the U.S. Treasury, he's been investigated internationally for, among other [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=475.2s)]
*  things, money laundering, illegal wiretapping and extortion, accusations he denies. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=479.91999999999996s)]
*  Myra Martini told us a Cypriot passport could make it easier for those sanctioned oligarchs [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  to buy property and move assets and that the cozy relationship between wealthy Russians and Cyprus [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=492.4s)]
*  is raising concern internationally. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=499.2s)]
*  If you are a small country that is very dependent on foreign money coming from one single country, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=501.92s)]
*  this also even may create a conflict, right? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=510.0s)]
*  Really, sanctions are only as strong as the weakest link. Is Cyprus the weakest link here? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=513.6s)]
*  I think Cyprus is one of the weakest links. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=518.64s)]
*  Then Cyprus minister of finance, Konstantinos Petridis, disagrees. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=522.16s)]
*  We first spoke to him last fall. His office oversaw efforts to freeze the Cyprus assets [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=526.72s)]
*  of anyone sanctioned by the EU. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=532.32s)]
*  Who has been sanctioned, specifically individuals within Cyprus? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=534.8000000000001s)]
*  Regarding the citizenship, I think about 10 people were found under restrictive measures, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=540.32s)]
*  and the council of ministers has initiated a process to revoke their passports. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=547.2s)]
*  The 10 people that have been sanctioned, who are they? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=553.28s)]
*  I don't have any names now. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=556.72s)]
*  But would you be able to provide us with that list of names if we asked for it? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=560.32s)]
*  I'm not sure. I would have to see it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=564.1600000000001s)]
*  We sent Minister Petridis a request for those names [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=567.6s)]
*  and the list of any assets of sanctioned Russians that Cyprus has seized or frozen. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=571.12s)]
*  In a series of emails, Petridis' office responded that, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=577.2s)]
*  due to European data protection rules, no detailed list can be made public. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=580.64s)]
*  But other EU countries have publicized detailed lists of their actions. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=586.72s)]
*  So is the expectation that everyone should just trust the Cyprus government [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=591.76s)]
*  that they're implementing the sanctions that they're supposed to on Russians? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=595.12s)]
*  I'm not saying that everybody should trust the Cyprus government. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=599.28s)]
*  The Cyprus government does not need somebody to trust it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=602.08s)]

*  We do admit that in the past there have been mistakes, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=620.08s)]

*  A big number, but just a fraction of the estimated 5.6 billion euros [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=638.08s)]
*  of Russian deposits made in Cyprus last year. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=642.96s)]
*  We also asked Minister Petridis about this. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=646.72s)]
*  The dozens of Cyprus properties and active shell companies [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=649.6s)]

*  Take the case of Roman Abramovich and his planes. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=671.04s)]
*  According to U.S. investigators, they were hidden under five shell companies [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=674.24s)]
*  stacked like Russian nesting dolls with addresses in the BVI and British island of Jersey, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=678.72s)]

*  But footy is a sport that makes American football look like a quilting bee. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=925.76s)]
*  It's a game of almost cartoonishly violent collisions without the benefit of pads. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=930.0s)]
*  It features non-stop trash talk and is played on a field practically the size of a speedway. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  As the name does suggest, Australian rules football is the national sport down under, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=941.04s)]
*  with games that draw 100,000 fans and TV audiences that per capita often outrate the NFL. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=946.0799999999999s)]
*  So why in the name of waltzing Matilda do crowds in Melbourne sometimes break into chants of USA USA? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=953.68s)]
*  The answer, as we first reported in April, they're cheering Mason Cox, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=961.04s)]
*  a Texan who stands nearly seven feet tall, ranks among the best footy players out there, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=965.68s)]
*  and might be the most unlikely success story in global sports today. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=971.04s)]
*  At first glance anyway, Mason Cox comes across as the quintessential Aussie rules or AFL player. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=981.68s)]
*  At age 32, he's logged more than 100 games over eight seasons for the [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=990.24s)]
*  storied Collingwood Magpies, the AFL's equivalent of the Dallas Cowboys, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=994.8000000000001s)]
*  and he is an evangelist for his sport. One played on an oval surface almost double the size of an [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=999.52s)]
*  NFL field. Footy entails players running about 10 miles a game, juking, tackling, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1005.52s)]
*  passing by punching the ball, and scoring by kicking the ball through goal posts. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1018.1600000000001s)]
*  Six points for splitting the center uprights, one point for the side ones. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1023.12s)]
*  It's unlike anything else you've ever seen. It's probably the roughest sport in the world, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1032.24s)]
*  I'd say. It's a mix of basketball, football, it's a mix of soccer, cricket even. There's really no [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1035.52s)]
*  rules. A few sticks at each end, just try to kick it through those and then whoever does that more [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1043.2s)]
*  than the other team wins. Sounds like fun. Yep. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1046.96s)]
*  Cox plays like a human blowtorch, not only catching and kicking, but mastering the art of the speccy, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1054.96s)]
*  a tactic that transforms an opponent's back into a stepladder. Yes, it's legal. It is one of the [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1062.0800000000002s)]
*  major things of AFL that people look at and they go, oh my gosh, that is insanity. To stick your [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1068.16s)]
*  knees on someone else's shoulder, launch yourself up to 15 feet in the air, take a grab, come down, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1072.4s)]
*  and then be looking at this guy going, yep, I just literally jumped on top of you. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1077.3600000000001s)]
*  Like getting dunked on. Yep, it's very similar. Cox already a big target, nose of good hands. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1081.6000000000001s)]
*  But Mason Cox is the most unlikely player in the history of the sport. Never mind that at [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1088.0s)]
*  six foot 11 he's the tallest player ever to suit up, or that he's the only American in the league, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1093.2800000000002s)]
*  he lived the first 23 years of his life without knowing the sport of footy even existed. He may [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1098.96s)]
*  be an Aussie celebrity and may recently have starred in the AFL's equivalent of the Super Bowl, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1104.88s)]
*  but is still mastering the sport's nuances. And he's still fuzzy on basic footy facts, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1110.24s)]
*  as we observed at practice. Kangaroo brand. What's this made out of? Kangaroo skin. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1116.0s)]
*  Roam. Pig skin. What's a pig skin? I should probably learn a few things. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1122.1599999999999s)]
*  Think they give him grief about that? You should hear them ribbing him about his accent. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1128.9599999999998s)]
*  Here's Collingwood captain Darcy Moore. He's kind of this weird fusion between [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1133.9199999999998s)]
*  southern drawl and Aussie accent. That's an interesting mashup. He definitely loves putting [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1138.3999999999999s)]
*  it on in the locker room. That's for sure. The Texas drawl. He puts the Aussie on for us. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1143.84s)]
*  You think the football, made of cowhide by the way, travels in strange trajectories, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1148.3200000000002s)]
*  get a load of Cox's story. What would you say the odds of success were going to be? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1153.28s)]
*  You could comfortably say one in a million. One in a million. Because there's so many talented [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1158.64s)]
*  players all around the country that just never make it. And the odds of succeeding are just so, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1163.3600000000001s)]
*  it's so difficult. Like any professional sport, there are so many things seen and unseen that [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1168.4s)]
*  make it really hard to succeed. No skills, no track record. Yeah. No knowledge. No knowledge. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1174.08s)]
*  Living, you know, thousands of miles from home by himself. It's an extraordinary thing. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1180.32s)]
*  Home for Cox was suburban Dallas, where in high school he had to duck under doorways, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1185.9199999999998s)]
*  but played soccer. It was a great annoyance of classmates who played hoops. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1190.72s)]
*  There's no way that he's not on the basketball team at seven foot. What else could you possibly [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1195.36s)]
*  do at seven feet tall other than play basketball, right? And Mason is a prime example that there's [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1200.08s)]
*  a whole possibility of things you can do at seven foot. That's Marcus Smart, now a Boston Celtic [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1207.1999999999998s)]
*  star, who went to high school with Cox. Here, here, here. Height is wasted on the tall. That's [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1212.72s)]
*  the old saying, you know, he, all this height was wasted on this tall dude for nothing. But as we've [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1217.28s)]
*  seen, it's not wasted at all. After high school, Cox went to Oklahoma State, majoring in engineering. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1222.1599999999999s)]
*  As a sophomore, he was approached about an unusual on-campus job, practicing with the women's [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1228.48s)]
*  basketball team and simulating tall opposing players, including Brittany Griner. When the [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1233.76s)]
*  men's team was short on height, they too called on Cox, which reunited him with Smart, then the team [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1239.92s)]
*  star. Mason Cox back into the game. A walk on, Cox spent part of three seasons as the last option [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1245.76s)]
*  off the bench for OSU. He says he did guard and bead for a little bit. He did guard and bead for [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1252.32s)]
*  a little bit. When he was at KU, he did guard and bead for a little bit. Yes, when OSU once played [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1258.24s)]
*  Kansas, Cox matched up against Joellen Beed, now one of the NBA's best players, and Cox held his [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1264.56s)]
*  own. He's always had a little spunk, a little fire to him. He had moments where, you know, he'd be [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1270.88s)]
*  like, Mason, like, it was like, wow, I didn't know you could, you know what I'm saying, I didn't know you had that in you, like, is everything okay? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1275.6s)]
*  Know a little bit about being a physical athlete. Just a, just a little bit, just a little bit. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1281.04s)]
*  Shortly before graduating in 2014, Cox lined up a six-figure engineering job at Exxon Mobil. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1285.36s)]
*  Then came an intriguing opportunity. A scout hunting for graduating college athletes contacted OSU [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1291.12s)]
*  to see if Cox might want to attend a combine in Los Angeles for this thing called AFL. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1297.36s)]
*  You'd never heard of it? Oh, no, I'd never heard of it. Like, never once had a word have been spoken [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1303.12s)]
*  about in my life. So we Googled it, as everyone does, and then this thing comes up and it's like [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1308.0s)]
*  AFL's biggest hits and it is literally people getting knocked unconscious. And yet you go to [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1312.32s)]
*  this combine. I have no idea what I'm getting myself into. I land in LA, I get picked up in an unmarked [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1316.96s)]
*  white van, thrown in the back, and he goes, we're gonna go to the hotel and we're gonna do three days of training. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1323.04s)]
*  Hand pass from Lester Smith to Matthews, his steady shoots at goal. If Americans know Aussie rules [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1329.36s)]
*  football at all, it's likely because in the 1980s, before it could afford NBA or NFL rights, ESPN [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1334.56s)]
*  aired AFL games. But the sport was founded in the 1800s as a way for cricketers to stay in shape in [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1341.36s)]
*  the off season. It's especially popular in Melbourne, where the MCG, at nearly a hundred thousand capacity, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1347.76s)]
*  the largest stadium in the southern hemisphere, will routinely fill for games. After the combine, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1355.28s)]
*  Cox was summoned to Melbourne, where he impressed Australian coaches with his height and his surprising [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1361.28s)]
*  agility. Soon after, he declined his job at Exxon and signed with Collingwood. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1366.8s)]
*  We get the initial taste of what he's capable of. Can't kick, can't handball, but seven foot tall. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1372.8s)]
*  Craig McRae is now the team's head coach. In 2014, he was the head of development and assigned to [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1378.96s)]
*  Tudor Cox. He'd finished college, he wanted to travel Europe, but he took the football with him. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1385.44s)]
*  I get this video late at night of Mason kicking the ball in some forest in Scandinavia somewhere. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1389.6s)]
*  And there's Mason running really awkwardly carrying the ball like this and then chopping [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1396.8s)]
*  the ball onto his foot. There was progression, but there's still a long way to go. See what he does. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1402.24s)]
*  Cox approached his development like the engineer he was supposed to be. And that's why they pay him [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1407.04s)]
*  the big bucks. Making steady and deliberate progress, solving the physics of using his height [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1411.6s)]
*  as an advantage, not a liability. And he's doing all of this with guys that have been playing their [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1416.3999999999999s)]
*  whole lives. Yeah, well we grew up, you know, sleeping with little footballs. Yeah, we slept [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1423.2s)]
*  and breathed it and idolized the game. Mason had none of that. What made you think he could pull it [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1429.6000000000001s)]
*  off? He's got that chip that, hey, I'm going to prove a lot of people wrong. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1435.8400000000001s)]
*  Present arms! [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1439.44s)]
*  Cox made his big league debut in April 2016 on the hallowed ground of the MCG, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1450.56s)]
*  an annual rivalry game held on Anzac Day, a national holiday. I remember sitting in this [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1456.24s)]
*  locker room just thinking to myself, holy smokes. Like this has happened pretty quickly. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1462.3200000000002s)]
*  You're sitting here about to play in front of the most passionate fans probably in the world [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1469.1200000000001s)]
*  on one of the biggest days and you barely know what this sport is. I still had questions on [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1473.6s)]
*  rules at that point. Like I didn't 100% know what was going on. He was standing arm in arm [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1478.96s)]
*  with his teammates when Australia's national anthem started. I think to myself, I go, I don't know [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1486.16s)]
*  word. And everyone else is belting him out next to me. So I kind of just laughed myself and just [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1491.44s)]
*  kind of hum along. I had no idea. And that kind of took the nerves away. That settled me. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1495.76s)]
*  The game started as if scripted. Cue the sports movie music. A ball spilled out. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1502.32s)]
*  Darcy Moore got the ball and saw Cox in the distance and punted it to the rookie [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1508.16s)]
*  who caught it and scored with his very first kick. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1514.24s)]
*  He rides it home. What a beauty. Can you believe an American in his first game has just kicked the [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1517.52s)]
*  first goal on Anzac Day? That day I think was one of those days that solidified that this might be [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1525.44s)]
*  something I'm going to do for quite a long time. Cox was literally off and running. His breakout [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1531.04s)]
*  performance two seasons later in the preliminary final, like the NFL's Conference Championship [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1535.8400000000001s)]
*  game, suggested he could be a star. Having crossed 15 time zones, Cox's parents were in the stand [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1540.64s)]
*  that day as he scored three times. Can he guide it through? Yes, he can. Three of the very best. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1546.8s)]
*  It's one of the greatest stories I reckon in Australian football unfolding before our very eyes. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1554.56s)]
*  As Mason Cox became a fan favorite, he also developed into what locals would call a fair [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1562.3999999999999s)]
*  dinkum Aussie. This country's really got my heart, I think. I'm still marveling at your accent. Are [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1567.68s)]
*  you the most American Australian or the most Australian American? Probably the most Australian [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1574.0s)]
*  American. I still love America. I'm still American, but I'm half and half now. Flanked by his captain, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1578.24s)]
*  his coach, and his parents, he got his Australian citizenship to prove it. And he's seen more of the [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1585.28s)]
*  country's exquisite landscape than most natives. But as in any sports movie, there were setbacks. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1590.24s)]
*  In this play, he resembled a basketball player who headed down court for getting to dribble. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1596.72s)]
*  When Cox was a rookie new to the sport, these bloopers were part of the Novelty Act. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1604.88s)]
*  When Cox was a veteran, the passionate Collingwood fans were less forgiving. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1610.64s)]
*  You've seen that? Yeah, yeah. The judgment, the criticism. Adding injury to insult, in 2019, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1615.12s)]
*  Cox was raked across the eye in a game and diagnosed with two torn retinas, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1621.68s)]
*  leaving him temporarily blinded. That, he says, was when he felt the distance from home. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1626.72s)]
*  I lost one of my senses all within 48 hours. And I had to figure out if I was ever going to play [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1632.72s)]
*  AFL again, if I was ever going to see again. What's that internal conversation going like? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1638.4s)]
*  You know, did I do the right thing coming here? Now I have something that's probably going to [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1642.56s)]
*  affect me for the rest of my life. Was it worth it? And you feel quite isolated and alone. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1646.24s)]
*  Six surgeries later, he regained most of his vision, but was a diminished player, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1653.52s)]
*  and the great American experiment looked to be fizzling. Then Cox made an equipment change, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1658.16s)]
*  adding another distinguishing feature, becoming the first AFL-er to wear prescription goggles. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1664.0s)]
*  He had one of his best years. This year, Cox's coaches say he's never looked better. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1669.2s)]
*  That's pretty damn good. I'm watching your practice thinking Americans would love this. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1674.72s)]
*  Oh, would go crazy for it. So in 20 years, if there are a dozen Americans playing in the AFL, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1678.8000000000002s)]
*  how's that go over with you? I would love an American to break every single record I've done, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1684.72s)]
*  because it means that I've left a mark, you know? You know how extraordinary and unlikely the story [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1688.96s)]
*  is. I'm going to look back and think, you had the most ridiculous life you could possibly think of [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1694.0s)]
*  that makes no sense. And I took it by the horns. I made the most of it. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1700.08s)]
*  Jeff Koons is one of the most prominent and polarizing art stars in the world. Perhaps [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1715.44s)]
*  you've seen one of his giant balloon dog sculptures, or the stainless steel inflatable [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1720.56s)]
*  rabbit he made that resold for $91 million a few years ago, the highest price ever paid at auction [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1725.1200000000001s)]
*  for work by a living artist. I bought a much less expensive work of his at a charity auction about [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1731.28s)]
*  10 years ago. His creations may look simple, but as we first reported last spring, they can take [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1736.72s)]
*  decades to make and often push the boundaries of technology and sometimes taste. Critics may scoff [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1743.68s)]
*  at times, but that's nothing new. Jeff Koons has been controversial since he first started showing [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1750.48s)]
*  his art more than 40 years ago. You'll find the largest collection of Jeff Koons' work at the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1755.7600000000002s)]
*  Broad Museum in Los Angeles. Visiting it is like showing up at a strange children's party long [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1762.96s)]
*  after the kids have gone to bed. There's a giant painting of a party hat, a porcelain Michael Jackson [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1768.88s)]
*  and his chimp bubbles, a kind of pop culture pieta. The Hulk even makes an appearance. The star [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1774.96s)]
*  attraction, a 10-foot tall stainless steel balloon dog sculpture. I believe the first piece Koons [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1781.6000000000001s)]
*  showed it to us after hours. We had to make machines to make this work. They didn't exist. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1787.3600000000001s)]
*  It may look like it's filled with air, but balloon dog weighs more than a ton [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1793.0400000000002s)]
*  and took Jeff Koons six years to make. I started with a balloon and I blew it up. I twisted a [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1797.2s)]
*  balloon dog. Did you know how to make a balloon dog? No, I just got a little book and I saw how [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1804.16s)]
*  you do it. So I twisted up. I probably made about 50 of them and I made a mold of it and then that [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1809.3600000000001s)]
*  was used to make the stainless steel pieces. You know, originally when I made this piece, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1814.48s)]
*  I thought that I could make it for about $300,000, which still that's a lot of money, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1820.16s)]
*  but it ended up just to create the piece ended up costing me $1.6. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1825.6799999999998s)]
*  Wow. And that was more than what I had sold the work for. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1830.08s)]
*  That's classic Koons. He's famous for going over budget and his obsessive attention to detail is [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1834.7199999999998s)]
*  legendary. He spent 20 years figuring out how to turn this massive aluminum into a 10-foot tall [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1840.6399999999999s)]
*  pile of Play-Doh. To get these basketballs to appear suspended in air, he enlisted the [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1847.36s)]
*  help of a Nobel prize-winning physicist and he used more than 60,000 living flowers to create [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1852.88s)]
*  this 40-foot sculpture of a puppy. Koons often takes famous characters or artworks and plays [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1859.3600000000001s)]
*  with them, adding a gazing ball to the Mona Lisa, or he elevates everyday things, making them larger, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1865.6000000000001s)]
*  shinier or surreal versions of themselves. The rabbit's from 86. 86. Like that rabbit [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1872.96s)]
*  resold a few years ago for $91 million. He made four that look at first as if they're just plastic [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1879.52s)]
*  inflatables, but they're highly polished stainless steel and weigh about 150 pounds. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1885.6s)]
*  It's iconic because it can represent so many different things. I can think of Easter, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1891.44s)]
*  I can think of a politician with a kind of a microphone, somebody making proclamations, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1896.24s)]
*  I can think of a Playboy rabbit, but I think one of the most important things to me, the reason [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1902.08s)]
*  it's reflective and reflecting you, reflecting me, you know, the viewer finishes a work of art. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1907.68s)]
*  It's about your feelings, your experiences, it's about your potential. Maybe you're thinking Jeff [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1914.3200000000002s)]
*  Koons sounds like a phony self-help prophet, plenty of critics do, but he does see art as something [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1922.3200000000002s)]
*  that can help people have a personal transformation. Art can be anything, I mean it really can be. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1928.5600000000002s)]
*  My personal experience of art is that you just don't have to bring anything to it other than [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1934.48s)]
*  yourself. So your message to people is you don't need to have a thesis in art history to interact [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1941.52s)]
*  with art and what you feel from it is valid. It's as valid as anybody else could experience. Why [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1949.3600000000001s)]
*  balloon dogs, why gazing balls, an inflatable rabbit? Memories, you know, around Easter time, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1957.2s)]
*  I would see a lot of inflatable rabbits in the yards. I would see gazing balls in people's yards, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1964.08s)]
*  in their gardens. Our neighbors who do that, I mean how generous they are for us that we're just [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1971.76s)]
*  driving by or walking by and we can look and we can have a little awe and wonderment just for that [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1977.84s)]
*  a second. To me they're symbols of cultural history. Koons grew up outside York, Pennsylvania [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1983.6799999999998s)]
*  in a rural community where you can still find gazing balls in people's yards. He has eight [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1992.24s)]
*  children, six with his second wife Justine to whom he's been married for 22 years. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=1998.0s)]
*  They still live part-time in Pennsylvania in Koons's grandparents house, part of an 800-acre [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2003.76s)]
*  farm where they raise horses and cows. I think most people don't envision that this is the life [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2009.44s)]
*  you have as a world famous artist. You know I'm very involved with my work but on the weekends [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2015.44s)]
*  and summers, holidays, it's a really important part of my life. Koons has been drawing and painting [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2022.8s)]
*  since childhood. In 1974 while studying art in college his mother helped him meet one of his [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2028.8s)]
*  favorite surrealist painters. My mother called me and she said I just saw in a magazine that Salvador [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2034.56s)]
*  Dali spends half his year in New York City at the St. Regis Hotel and I thought oh okay maybe [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2041.68s)]
*  you know I'll call. You just thought you'd call him? I called the St. Regis. I asked for Salvador [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2049.84s)]
*  Dali's room and they put me through. You know I was quite nervous but I told him I was a fan [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2056.4s)]
*  and that I would enjoy very much to meet him and he said can you come to New York this weekend [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2062.0s)]
*  on Saturday and I said yes. He said be in the lobby at 12 o'clock and I'll meet you then and [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2068.72s)]
*  he was spectacular. It would never have occurred to me to like just call Salvador Dali in his hotel [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2075.52s)]
*  room. I had nothing to lose you know. Koons and Dali spent the afternoon together and at the end [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2081.04s)]
*  of it he asked the world-renowned artist to pose for this picture. I remember he put his mustache [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2087.12s)]
*  up and he was telling me you know kid hurry up I can't hold this pose all day but I left [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2093.2s)]
*  New York that evening feeling like I could do this. After finishing school he hitchhiked to New York [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2100.3199999999997s)]
*  and started making art in his Lower East Side apartment buying cheap plastic inflatables and [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2107.3599999999997s)]
*  putting them on mirrors. Koons had grand ambitions but he needed cash to realize them. So eventually [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2112.64s)]
*  I became licensed and registered to sell commodities and mutual funds and so you know that's what I [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2119.36s)]
*  started to do to be able to make more money to make the works. That's not a career move a lot of artists [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2126.08s)]
*  make. Well you know I did it only that I could make enough money to make my vacuum cleaner pieces. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2132.56s)]
*  The vacuum cleaners he's talking about were what first got him noticed in 1980. He bought about 20 [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2139.28s)]
*  brand new vacuums and displayed them in cases with fluorescent lights. It was part of a series [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2145.04s)]
*  called The New. I was showing them for their newness that this was a brand new object it was [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2150.64s)]
*  never used. You can see that it's clean it's pristine its lungs are pure and there's also [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2157.7599999999998s)]
*  some sensual aspects to it too. They can have sensual aspects. Sensual I mean you have the handle [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2164.16s)]
*  and you have the bag right there it could be looked at as masculine or you could look at it [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2170.0s)]
*  and say oh you know the bag is the womb. Art definitely is in the eye of the beholder. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2175.2s)]
*  What did you think of Jeff Koons as an artist when he first sort of came on the scene? I was [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2181.92s)]
*  interested in him and I also was kind of repulsed by him. Robert Storr former dean of the Yale [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2186.88s)]
*  School of Art was a curator at the Museum of Modern Art in New York when it acquired some of Koons's [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2192.64s)]
*  vacuums in 1996. I think some of the work is really unpleasant but it doesn't mean it's not [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2197.76s)]
*  serious. What's unpleasant about it? The imagery is vulgar okay now vulgar means many things it [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2203.28s)]
*  means of the people rather than of the elites. So it's taking an object which the New York elites [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2210.8s)]
*  might look at and think oh that's tacky that's yeah that's trashy that's something you buy in a [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2216.6400000000003s)]
*  gift shop and it's blowing it up and making it perfect and saying that this has value? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2221.7599999999998s)]
*  It has meaning not necessarily value but it has meaning. What is the message of that? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2228.96s)]
*  The message is that it is there to be embraced that it is not to be mocked that one should not [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2232.88s)]
*  be smugly sure of one's own taste to the point of denying the possibility of other tastes. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2238.16s)]
*  And is he being honest about that? I think he's being totally honest and I think that he has made [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2244.0s)]
*  all of that fair game in a way that we have not seen since Warhol. Like Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2250.56s)]
*  has a factory of sorts with an assembly line of painters meticulously following his instructions [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2257.92s)]
*  and dozens of digital assistants, sculptors and craftsmen all over the world helping make [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2263.92s)]
*  his complex pieces which are often inspired by very simple things. This is like a very [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2269.36s)]
*  modern grandmother's closet. Turns out Koons was fascinated by his grandparents porcelain [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2275.2s)]
*  figurines as a child and has collected hundreds of them. Where did you find this? I found it online. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2280.72s)]
*  He decided to make this 150 dollar ballerina into a multi-million dollar eight foot tall marble [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2288.0s)]
*  sculpture but it wound up taking him 12 years. First he used a CAT scan machine to digitally [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2293.3599999999997s)]
*  map every detail of the figurine inside and out. Then it took him five years and the help of MIT [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2299.92s)]
*  scientists to begin translating all those details into instructions for machines to carve the [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2306.16s)]
*  sculpture. The actual carving took another seven years. Now the work will really progress quickly. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2311.84s)]
*  We went with Koons to a workshop in Pennsylvania to check on the progress [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2320.7200000000003s)]
*  and found Ayami Aoyama and her team carefully polishing the ballerina by hand. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2325.2000000000003s)]
*  Do you have a sense of how many hours of work is done on a piece? 33,000 hours. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2330.7200000000003s)]
*  Hours for just the hand work. It must be exhausting. I mean the level of detail and [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2337.6000000000004s)]
*  monotony and difficulty of it is incredible. Yeah it is like a really unique job I would say. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2342.88s)]
*  That looks like a sort of a dental tool. What is this? Yeah that nail polisher that you know [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2350.08s)]
*  that lady sucks. Really? Yeah. You'll notice Jeff Koons isn't doing the sculpting or painting. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2354.4s)]
*  He comes up with the ideas and sets the standards but his artisans do the labor [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2361.68s)]
*  which has led to criticism including from our own Morley Safer. So what do you say to the man? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2366.24s)]
*  30 years ago Morley did a story critiquing contemporary art and likened Koons to a PT [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2371.52s)]
*  Barnault selling to suckers. He doesn't actually paint or sculpt. He commissions craftsmen to do [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2377.12s)]
*  that or he goes shopping for basketballs and vacuum cleaners. Is that a legitimate criticism? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2383.44s)]
*  It's a legitimate criticism if you look at art in a way that you're kind of want everything to [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2389.92s)]
*  be done by the artists themselves but it becomes very limited what you can do within one life [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2396.88s)]
*  if you're being responsible for everything. It's like the production of this program right now. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2404.32s)]
*  Anderson if you had to be responsible for the lighting, if you had to be responsible for [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2411.44s)]
*  editing. If I was responsible for the lighting you would we wouldn't see you or myself. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2415.92s)]
*  But if you'd have to be responsible for everything I mean how many programs would you be able to [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2419.84s)]
*  create? I've designed, worked on the systems so that the whole process at the end of the day it's [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2425.6800000000003s)]
*  as if every mark was made by myself. At 68 Koons has reached a level of commercial success [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2432.8s)]
*  few artists ever imagined. He's helped design cars for BMW, an album cover for Lady Gaga, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2439.76s)]
*  even a super yacht. That one angle. And later this year he hopes to create a permanent art [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2447.36s)]
*  exhibit on the moon. He's made 125 small stainless steel moon sculptures and mounted them on a lunar [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2452.96s)]
*  lander that'll hitch a ride aboard a SpaceX rocket. Is there something about the atmosphere [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2460.24s)]
*  on the moon that would affect the lifespan of a work? Yeah almost everything. You know you have [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2465.2799999999997s)]
*  tremendous radiation, you have the temperature change, at least 250 degrees difference from night [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2471.3599999999997s)]
*  to day. One of the most inhospitable environments that you know you could imagine for a work of art. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2478.72s)]
*  The moon sculptures are for sale of course along with an NFT or non-fungible token which [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2486.48s)]
*  serves as digital proof your artwork is actually up there. You'll also get one of these larger [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2492.4s)]
*  moons to show off here on earth. He won't say how much it'll cost you but with Jeff Koons it's a [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2498.2400000000002s)]
*  safe bet the price tag will be out of this world. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2504.48s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim, we'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2516.48s)]
*  My name is Nora, how are you doing? We go to stories, we travel there because we can bring [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2525.52s)]
*  someone to that story. We can be their eyes, we can be their ears. What's the number one need [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2531.1200000000003s)]
*  for Ukrainians? Body armor and helmets. The amount of devastation is unfathomable. The house was [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2535.76s)]
*  shaken so bad and the roof just flew right past. Oh sweetheart I'm so sorry. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2540.56s)]
*  We lost it all. Oh my god I'm so sorry. We listen to a diverse group of people and people of different [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2547.6s)]
*  viewpoints. Can I ask you about what you're doing here? The cost of feeding a family of four went [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2554.48s)]
*  up from last November to this November. I'm feeding a family of 20,000. That human connection that we [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2559.2s)]
*  create on the broadcast every night is incredibly important. You have spinal issues and you can hit [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2564.0s)]
*  the ball that far. It feels so good. That's so incredible because the news doesn't have to always [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2568.64s)]
*  be depressing. It can be uplifting. Goodie tell me what do you love about running? Energy! [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBDVSuHTOk&t=2574.96s)]
