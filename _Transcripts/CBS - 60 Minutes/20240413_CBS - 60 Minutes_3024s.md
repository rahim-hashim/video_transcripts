# World's Most Interesting Places: Vol. 2 | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I)
*  It turns out Saddam Hussein did possess a weapon of mass destruction, and he used it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=0.0s)]
*  in a slaughter that few people have heard of until now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=18.62s)]
*  After the Gulf War in 1991, Saddam spent untold millions on a weapon designed to exterminate [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=22.72s)]
*  an ancient civilization called the Madan, also known as the Marsh Arabs. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=29.24s)]
*  They lived in Iraq between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, where many biblical scholars [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  placed the Garden of Eden. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=39.58s)]
*  But if this was the place where man fell from grace, Saddam showed just how far man can [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=41.94s)]
*  fall. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=47.76s)]
*  In a spectacular feat of engineering, he used water in a strike against his own people that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=48.86s)]
*  not even an atom bomb could match. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=54.66s)]
*  Recently we journeyed there with an American engineer who's resurrecting this magical [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=57.12s)]
*  land that was turned to dust by Saddam's secret weapon. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=62.4s)]
*  We are now officially inside the marsh. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=67.64s)]
*  And you can see that it's getting denser and denser, taller and taller. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=73.96s)]
*  Azzam Al-Wash grew up in the water world that the Greeks named Mesopotamia, the land between [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  two rivers. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=83.92s)]
*  I've got to tell you, this is not like any part of Iraq I've ever seen before. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=85.48s)]
*  I mean, when you say Iraq, it's a desert, right? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=88.48s)]
*  It's burning oil. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=90.92s)]
*  It's magical is what it is. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  This is magic. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=96.0s)]
*  It's been more than 30 years since he pushed through the reeds with his father, who ran [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=98.42s)]
*  the irrigation office here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=102.68s)]
*  So I have very warm memories of this place. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=104.64s)]
*  In 1978, Al-Wash left to study in America and became a partner in an engineering firm. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=107.64s)]
*  I achieved the American dream, Scott. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  You'd been living in the United States for 25 years. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=116.28s)]
*  You were an American citizen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=118.96s)]
*  You married an American woman. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=120.72s)]
*  Your children are as American as they can be. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=122.64s)]
*  And I'm as American as can be. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=124.84s)]
*  Why did you imagine going back to Iraq after the life you had built? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=126.52s)]
*  I realized at some point in time that money and success in the American dream is not everything. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=132.12s)]
*  Working on passion and something that drives you is everything. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=137.92s)]
*  His passion is a world where mother nature meets father time. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=142.76s)]
*  It's the cradle of civilization outlined by the Tigris and Euphrates, the likely birthplace [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=147.56s)]
*  of agriculture, the written word, and the wheel. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  But once the ancients set civilization on its course, the Medan stayed behind. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  Their villages are primitive. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=165.82s)]
*  They weave a life out of the reeds of the marsh. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=167.84s)]
*  They bind them into homes, feed them to their water buffalo, and burn them to bake their bread. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=171.04s)]
*  There's not much in the way of electricity, education, or health care. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=177.04s)]
*  But elders like Sahih Saleh told us they did just fine until 1991, when they suffered their own kind of holocaust. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=183.04s)]
*  That was when the U.S. and its allies invaded southern Iraq to throw Saddam out of Kuwait. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=196.04s)]
*  But there's another way for the bloodshed to stop. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=204.04s)]
*  The elder President Bush urged Iraqis to overthrow their dictator. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=206.04s)]
*  To take matters into their own hands. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=210.04s)]
*  The Medan and other Shiites in the south supported an uprising to topple Saddam's regime. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=212.04s)]
*  The marshes, known for ages as a smuggler's paradise, turned out to be a perfect place for the rebels to hide [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=219.04s)]
*  with their endless maze of waterways like these on the Iranian border. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=226.04s)]
*  But in 1991, when the allies withdrew, Saddam turned Eden into hell. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=232.04s)]
*  The United Nations Environmental Program called it the biggest engineered environmental disaster of the last century. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=240.04s)]
*  Saddam tried to wipe out the Marsh Arabs by destroying their world. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=246.04s)]
*  He built six canals to divert the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates out into the desert and the Persian Gulf. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=250.04s)]
*  In a five-year project, he drained 90% of the marshes, an area of more than 3,000 square miles. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  As an engineer, I'm telling you, drying up the marshes is definitely not an easy task. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  It's a monumental engineering project. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  He put every piece of equipment available in Iraq under his control at the services of the projects needed to dry the marshes. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=274.04s)]
*  Saddam was using water as a weapon. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=281.04s)]
*  The world was looking for weapons of mass destruction and the evidence was right under its nose. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=284.04s)]
*  This is a Medan village shot by National Geographic in the 1970s when the marshes were the Middle East's largest wetland. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=289.04s)]
*  And this is what most of the region looked like after the man-made drought. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=298.04s)]
*  To get a sense of the scale of the engineering project, we went to have a look with the Illinois National Guard's 106th Aviation Wing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=304.04s)]
*  That's one of Saddam's canals, designed to capture the water, carry it past the marshes and dump it in the Persian Gulf. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=315.04s)]
*  One embankment runs through the middle of the picture, but this man-made canal is so wide you can hardly see the other side more than a mile away. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=325.04s)]
*  In fact, it's wider than the Euphrates itself. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=335.04s)]
*  It's an unbelievable engineering achievement. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=339.04s)]
*  This is my first time seeing it from the air this close up, and it is spectacular. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=342.04s)]
*  No one will ever know how many lives were lost and how many families were left in misery by the genocide that followed. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=349.04s)]
*  They didn't even wait for nature to die a natural death. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=357.04s)]
*  As soon as the embankments were finished, they put light to the reeds of the marshes. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=360.04s)]
*  Set fire to the reeds. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=364.04s)]
*  Set fire to the reeds. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=365.04s)]
*  The cradle of civilization... [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=371.04s)]
*  Where Eden was? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=372.04s)]
*  ...was desiccated. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=373.04s)]
*  Dead? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=374.04s)]
*  We met some of the survivors, like Sheikh Hassan, returning to the rubble left by Saddam's army. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=376.04s)]
*  What happened to the village after everyone was ordered out? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=383.04s)]
*  I mean, what happened to this house? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=386.04s)]
*  The government gave us three days to get out before the tanks came and crushed our houses. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=390.04s)]
*  They destroyed about 180 houses in the area. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=395.04s)]
*  Hassan told us that many of his tribesmen were found in mass graves. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=399.04s)]
*  Across the region, thousands were killed. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=404.04s)]
*  About 100,000 were forced from their homes. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=406.04s)]
*  But then, 12 years later, when Saddam fell, Azam Al-Wash helped launch a counterattack on the fortress of drought. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=409.04s)]
*  We're coming to it right there. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=418.04s)]
*  Oh, this is where you knocked the hole in the dike? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=420.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=422.04s)]
*  So you brought heavy earth moving equipment in and knocked a hole in what Saddam's engineers had built. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=423.04s)]
*  Indeed. I got the last laugh. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=429.04s)]
*  It was the beginning of his group called Nature Iraq that has developed a plan to restore the marshes. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=434.04s)]
*  The thing is, it was a small hole. As the water starts flowing, it started digging its own passageway. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=440.04s)]
*  You just had to break it? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=446.04s)]
*  Just let the water start going. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=447.04s)]
*  So the Euphrates just pushed its way through there once you broke it? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=449.04s)]
*  Yes. Once you let the water go in, it just makes its own way. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=451.04s)]
*  Al-Wash's travels can be dangerous. This is still a war zone. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=455.04s)]
*  We traveled with a security team lent by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and with a squad of Iraqi police. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=459.04s)]
*  Oh, the IP is following us. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=466.04s)]
*  They found us, yeah. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=468.04s)]
*  Al-Wash wasn't sure that just re-flooding the barren earth would resurrect what was lost. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=469.04s)]
*  But when we traveled deeper into the marshes, we saw what sprung up since the waters returned in 2003. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=475.04s)]
*  There. Oh, look at that. Look at that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=482.04s)]
*  We have entered another time. This is the water world in the middle of the desert. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=488.04s)]
*  Wow. All these houses built with nothing but reeds. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=495.04s)]
*  Without reeds, you can't have this way of life. Reeds are the skeleton of these people's lives. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=501.04s)]
*  The house of reeds is called a mudif. Al-Wash wanted one as a meeting hall for his project. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=507.04s)]
*  And we were there to watch the construction. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=514.04s)]
*  It's made of nothing but reeds bound by reeds. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=518.04s)]
*  The arches are planted in the ground and pulled into shape. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=523.04s)]
*  Then woven mats cover the top. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=528.04s)]
*  Al-Wash's mudif is 15 feet tall and 70 feet long. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=531.04s)]
*  It's where we did our interview and where one of the village elders came to entertain us. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=536.04s)]
*  Have a look at the mudif and compare it to this 5,000-year-old carving. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=542.04s)]
*  Turns out they do build them like they used to. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=548.04s)]
*  Near the marshes, the Sumerians erected this temple at the city of Ur. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=552.04s)]
*  The Sumerians thought the marshes were so important, they wrote a story about them. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=558.04s)]
*  The story goes that the gods grew angry at man, so they sent a deluge to cover the earth. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=565.04s)]
*  One of the gods thought that was a terrible idea, so he warned one man to build a boat and save all the animals. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=571.04s)]
*  The people of this region came up with that story hundreds of years before the Old Testament gave us Noah. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=579.04s)]
*  The city of Ur is said to be the birthplace of Abraham. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=587.04s)]
*  The father of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=591.04s)]
*  Now his descendants are returning to a life that he might have recognized. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=594.04s)]
*  This cluster behind us is a cluster of about three islands built by generations, over generations. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=600.04s)]
*  Dirt, reed, dirt, reed. Every time it settles, they add a new layer. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=606.04s)]
*  And that's how they make their islands. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=610.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=612.04s)]
*  That's the Sumerian creation story that God laid down reed, and then he built the island. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=613.04s)]
*  This is the creation story that God laid down reed mats and created man and created the world. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=618.04s)]
*  Indeed, indeed, exactly. They took it from their lives and of course the gods lived the way they do. And this is Eden. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=624.04s)]
*  What's happening now is sort of a second creation story. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=631.04s)]
*  Thousands of Marsh Arabs have returned to this land since the reflooding began. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=635.04s)]
*  And the Medan are rebuilding their islands with a few changes that Abraham would not have imagined. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=640.04s)]
*  These people are restoring the marshes not because they're tree huggers like I am. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=647.04s)]
*  They're restoring the marshes because they are trying to live. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=652.04s)]
*  It's not because they love the birds flying or the reeds look nice. It's about livelihood. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=658.04s)]
*  We saw that when we came up on a reed market. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=668.04s)]
*  Families were bringing their harvest to a place where the new waters spelled the end of Saddam's Road. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=672.04s)]
*  What is your hope for this place? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=680.04s)]
*  My hope is I see the marshes as a destination for ecotourism. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=682.04s)]
*  I see the marshes as a destination for archaeological tourism. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=688.04s)]
*  But that's a very nice picture. But this is a country at war. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=693.04s)]
*  Yeah, okay. So the war is not going to last forever. If you're going to dream, dream big. It's free. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=698.04s)]
*  Alwash is lobbying parliament to make his boyhood home Iraq's first national park. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=705.04s)]
*  But no matter how big the dream, the marshes will never be what they once were. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=711.04s)]
*  Upstream, as far as Turkey and Syria, there are more than 30 dams diverting water. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=717.04s)]
*  There's a serious drought right now and oil has been discovered here. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=723.04s)]
*  Exploration will surely follow. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=728.04s)]
*  Still, about 30% of the marshes have been reflooded. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=731.04s)]
*  The land of civilizations past has a future again. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=735.04s)]
*  One of the most significant efforts to study changes in the climate has been taking place near the top of the world. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=753.04s)]
*  It's a place called Petermann Glacier in Greenland, one of the largest glaciers in the Arctic Circle and a glacier that has experienced dramatic melting. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=759.04s)]
*  It is a harsh and dangerous environment, and it has drawn some of the world's leading climate scientists who are only able to work there a little over a month a year. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=768.04s)]
*  We wanted to see how that work is proceeding, how they're able to move equipment and people in such a hostile place, and what they've discovered so far. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=778.04s)]
*  So we went to the top of the world to find out. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=787.04s)]
*  Our journey took us 700 miles above the Arctic Circle to the U.S.'s Thule Air Force Base in northern Greenland, built at the start of the Cold War to watch for Soviet missiles. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=791.04s)]
*  It is an alien landscape, home to curious Arctic hares and packs of prehistoric-looking muskox. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=804.04s)]
*  From there, we flew even further. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=811.04s)]
*  The destination? Petermann Glacier. It's on the northwest coast of Greenland, just a few hundred miles south of the North Pole. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=819.04s)]
*  To get there in a helicopter took us four hours over a rarely seen landscape that is both severe and serene. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=828.04s)]
*  The last town we'd see was Conak, with 700 residents and more Huskies than people. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=842.04s)]
*  While the ice has locked in by ice nine months of the year, villagers have always hunted seal and narwhal to survive. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=851.04s)]
*  Greenland is three times the size of Texas, and 80% of it is covered in ice. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=860.04s)]
*  But it now loses more ice than it gains in snowfall every year. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=867.04s)]
*  We saw evidence of the imbalance everywhere. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=872.04s)]
*  The ice is covered with ice, and the ice is covered with ice across the ice, rivers of rushing meltwater, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=876.04s)]
*  and the occasional thunderous crack of icebergs dropping into the sea. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=883.04s)]
*  We still had 300 miles to go, and stopped twice to refuel along the way. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=889.04s)]
*  These barrels were left behind for us by the scientists who made the trip to Petermann Glacier three weeks earlier. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=896.04s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=903.04s)]
*  In the middle of nowhere. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=905.04s)]
*  This will keep us going for how much longer? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=907.04s)]
*  Yeah, we can fly two and a half hours. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=909.04s)]
*  Our pilots, native Greenlanders, kept a rifle nearby at each stop to protect us from polar bears. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=911.04s)]
*  Have you seen polar bears out here? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=918.04s)]
*  Yeah, a lot. So now it's ready. Now we're safe. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=920.04s)]
*  Today we arrived at Petermann Glacier. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=926.04s)]
*  There's the camp. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=928.04s)]
*  And spotted the ice camp below. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=930.04s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=933.04s)]
*  So who did you upset to get put out here? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=935.04s)]
*  The gods, the gods. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=938.04s)]
*  Keith Nichols is an expert in drilling in remote places. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=941.04s)]
*  And in terms of remote, this would be really hard to beat. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=945.04s)]
*  It feels like you're on another planet. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=949.04s)]
*  If you take a walk around here you could be expecting Scotty to beam you up. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=951.04s)]
*  It is extraordinary. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=955.04s)]
*  Nichols and a team of scientists were drawn to this remote sliver of Greenland, in part by these satellite images. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=957.04s)]
*  In 2010, a chunk of ice, four times the size of Manhattan, broke off. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=965.04s)]
*  Then, two years later, another large chunk came down. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=971.04s)]
*  The glacier has receded by 20 miles in five years. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=977.04s)]
*  Nichols and his team are trying to drill beneath it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=982.04s)]
*  This is a lot of work in difficult conditions. What do you hope to learn? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=986.04s)]
*  What we're trying to learn is how the oceans are interacting with the ice, how they're melting it. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=990.04s)]
*  We're trying to predict how in the future that melting might change. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=994.04s)]
*  To drill through the ice, they heated melt water from the glacier to make a hot water drill [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=998.04s)]
*  to pierce through the 300 foot thick ice. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1005.04s)]
*  There has to be serious challenge to running equipment like this in this kind of weather. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1009.04s)]
*  The biggest challenge is that we've got water and it's very cold. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1014.04s)]
*  So if you have water freezing in hoses that can be devastating for the projects. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1018.04s)]
*  This is the moment the coring machine struck the bottom of the sea floor. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1024.04s)]
*  A half mile beneath the ice, they made history. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1029.04s)]
*  It was the first time anyone has ever collected sediment from beneath the ice shelf in Greenland. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1033.04s)]
*  The ocean beneath ice shelves is probably the least accessible part of the world ocean. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1040.04s)]
*  And just getting access to that is a triumph, frankly, as far as we're concerned. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1045.04s)]
*  The ice shelf extends out from the glacier and floats on the ocean. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1050.04s)]
*  They believe it acts like a dam, holding back the ice from sliding into the sea. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1054.04s)]
*  If it goes away, sea levels go up. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1059.04s)]
*  Is there a sense of urgency in the work that you're doing? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1062.04s)]
*  So sea level rise is the big question that we're trying to get at. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1066.04s)]
*  And Peter Muglacio, this experiment here, gives us an opportunity to get at those processes, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1070.04s)]
*  to try and understand the basic physics as to how that can happen. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1076.04s)]
*  Our visit to the ice camp was cut short. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1080.04s)]
*  Our pilots warned us something called ice fog was moving in and could strand us here for days. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1083.04s)]
*  We hightailed it back to the helicopter, heading to another outpost of the expedition, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1089.04s)]
*  what the scientists call Boulder Camp, set up on the edge of Petermann Glacier. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1095.04s)]
*  Sean Marcott and a team of geologists have been here for weeks, gathering samples from rocks. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1101.04s)]
*  So this was probably deposited when the ice was maybe a few hundred to a few thousand feet thicker. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1108.04s)]
*  And when it was deposited, you're probably talking about maybe five, six hundred feet of ice above us. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1116.04s)]
*  Above where we are now. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1121.04s)]
*  Petermann would have been much larger, and it would have been dropping these rocks all over the surface. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1123.04s)]
*  To the person at home who's looking at you guys just chipping away at rocks and going, why should I care about this? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1129.04s)]
*  We know that if you warm the planet up, the glaciers respond, they melt. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1134.04s)]
*  The question is, at what rate, how fast is that going to happen, and where is it going to happen, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1138.04s)]
*  and where are the most vulnerable spots of this ice sheet? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1142.04s)]
*  To understand all of that, you have to understand how the ice sheet, what controls an ice sheet. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1145.04s)]
*  We need to understand this glacier so that we can provide a better prediction for the larger ice sheet. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1150.04s)]
*  That matters to us because of sea level. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1154.04s)]
*  If these glaciers can respond dynamically, then we should all be concerned because that can create dynamic changes in sea level and flood infrastructure. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1156.04s)]
*  And we need to know that for planning for the future. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1165.04s)]
*  We camped out next to the scientists. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1169.04s)]
*  With 24 hours of light, we slept in these tents under the midnight sun. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1171.04s)]
*  In the morning, we were shuttled out to meet the Odin, a Swedish icebreaker making its way around Petermann Glacier. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1178.04s)]
*  The Odin supports the scientists on land and acts as a floating laboratory. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1186.04s)]
*  Named after a Norse god who relentlessly sought wisdom, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1192.04s)]
*  it's home to more than 50 climate scientists from around the world with similar convictions. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1197.04s)]
*  Their work is funded mostly by the Swedish government and the US's National Science Foundation. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1204.04s)]
*  Larry Mayer is one of the geologists on the Odin. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1211.04s)]
*  He's using sonar to map the ocean floor, creating the first detailed maps that show how Petermann Glacier slid into the sea. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1214.04s)]
*  You can see it, like skid marks of a car at an accident scene. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1222.04s)]
*  Yeah, the ice went here and the ice went there. And we can see it, oh, it stopped here. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1227.04s)]
*  How much of the world's oceans have been mapped with this kind of detail? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1231.04s)]
*  Probably on the order of 6 or 7 percent. Very, very little. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1235.04s)]
*  You can only make the trip to Petermann Glacier a few weeks each summer when the ice melts enough to allow passage. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1240.04s)]
*  You can see those blocks of ice drifting by. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1247.04s)]
*  Expedition leader Alan Mix is running the ship's coring operation, trying to grab sediment from the sea floor. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1249.04s)]
*  It's actually our coring site right now is under that block of ice and we just can't get there. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1256.04s)]
*  So we're trying to drift with the ice and just sort of sneak up on it gently. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1262.04s)]
*  It's hard to sneak up on anything in an icebreaker. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1268.04s)]
*  The Odin doesn't so much as sail as it does smash the ice like a 13,000 ton hammer. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1271.04s)]
*  Once in position, they throw something called a piston core, like a dart, at the bottom of the ocean. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1279.04s)]
*  Oh, that doesn't sound good. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1285.04s)]
*  After multiple attempts. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1287.04s)]
*  Go to the next one, but we'll hit it with a gravity core. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1289.04s)]
*  A core sample like this is collected. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1292.04s)]
*  Inside the ice is a sample of the ice. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1296.04s)]
*  A sample like this is collected inside the ship's lab. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1298.04s)]
*  The multi-year process of investigating those cores begins. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1303.04s)]
*  What's your best guess? How old is this? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1307.04s)]
*  So the base of this core probably is no more than 10,000 years. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1310.04s)]
*  And Jennings is with the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1315.04s)]
*  She says each core holds clues about Peterman Glacier's past. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1319.04s)]
*  Well, we didn't really expect to find things living under the ice shelf, but we have. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1323.04s)]
*  What have you found? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1328.04s)]
*  This one we found is called Sibisidoides woollerstorfi. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1329.04s)]
*  It has a big name for a little bug. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1334.04s)]
*  It's easy for you to say. It looks like a little seashell. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1336.04s)]
*  And it is a seashell, but it's a single-celled animal. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1339.04s)]
*  That single-celled animal, like all living creatures, is made out of carbon, allowing scientists to determine when it lived. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1344.04s)]
*  Which tells you what? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1351.04s)]
*  We can use it with the sediments. So we can take then the depth scale here and convert it to H. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1353.04s)]
*  And then we can say, when did the ice retreat? How quickly did it retreat? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1358.04s)]
*  Was there a lot of meltwater coming out? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1363.04s)]
*  You can get all that from what looks like mud. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1366.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1368.04s)]
*  After a week in Greenland, we headed home. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1370.04s)]
*  But the scientists kept working, taking advantage of the final days of the short Arctic summer. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1373.04s)]
*  The 66 core samples they collected during their month at sea will be studied by scientists around the world for decades. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1380.04s)]
*  This is the largest core repository in the world. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1388.04s)]
*  Peter Domenical is a paleoclimatologist at Columbia University. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1391.04s)]
*  He says the cores collected in Greenland are like a black box of the Earth's inner workings. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1395.04s)]
*  This one he collected just south of Greenland. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1400.04s)]
*  So this is today's climate. And we've had about 10,000 years of relatively warm climate. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1404.04s)]
*  And then we go 10,000 years in the past. Boom. There's the last ice age. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1410.04s)]
*  This is when Long Island was formed, when Cape Cod was formed. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1415.04s)]
*  Go on and you can just find this color. And this is filled with these rocks, what we called ice rafted detritus. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1418.04s)]
*  Until this period, when whoa, there's another warm phase. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1424.04s)]
*  And then another cold phase. And then another warm phase. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1427.04s)]
*  And then a warm phase. A short cold phase. A longer warm phase. And then boom, another ice age. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1430.04s)]
*  And so you've had cold, warm, cold, warm, cold, warm today. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1436.04s)]
*  How do we know that the warming we're seeing now, how do we not know it's part of this warm, cold, warm, cold? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1444.04s)]
*  That's a great question. These transitions are gradual and kind of almost like a tide wave or something. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1451.04s)]
*  And this transition, when you get to today, goes boom, suddenly very warm. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1456.04s)]
*  Domenico says the cores pulled from Petermann Glacier will fill in a crucial piece of the climate change puzzle. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1461.04s)]
*  How impressive was it that they got to Petermann Glacier? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1468.04s)]
*  It's impressive. What's more impressive is that we haven't been there every year and that we're not doing this every year. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1472.04s)]
*  We should be doing this. We should be monitoring this whole system with much greater focus than we are now. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1478.04s)]
*  How quickly have we seen the changes in Greenland? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1487.04s)]
*  The changes that are happening right now as a result of human activities are remarkable and they're happening incredibly fast. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1490.04s)]
*  And they're, it's not only happening fast, but it's accelerating. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1497.04s)]
*  And it's important to really get our mind around what we're saying there. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1500.04s)]
*  We're not just saying that climate in the Arctic is changing. It's changing at an accelerating rate. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1503.04s)]
*  So it basically means it's starting to melt, but it's melting at a faster and faster clip. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1509.04s)]
*  So anyone who knows what it's like to fall off a cliff, that's what it's doing. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1513.04s)]
*  We're about to visit a place few people have seen firsthand, the Vatican Library, a vast collection of historic treasures beyond compare. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1531.04s)]
*  Founded over five centuries ago when Europe was coming out of the Dark Ages, a period of so-called humanism, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1540.04s)]
*  when the Catholic Church was open to new ideas in philosophy, science, and the human spirit. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1548.04s)]
*  It's the Pope's library, but it contains much more than just church documents. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1554.04s)]
*  There are manuscripts going back nearly 2,000 years on music and math, warfare and exploration, even cookbooks and love letters. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1559.04s)]
*  The library is closed to the public, a place for scholars only. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1568.04s)]
*  But the Vatican agreed to let us in to see some of the priceless artifacts of our collective past. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1573.04s)]
*  Welcome to the 15th century. In Rome, turn a corner and you bump into antiquity, a delicious mixed salad of present and past. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1585.04s)]
*  We arrived at the Vatican to find a medieval costume parade in progress. What better way to begin a trek through history. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1595.04s)]
*  There's about two million printed books. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1605.04s)]
*  Two million printed books. And inside the library, the past surrounded us again, as we were shown the magnificent building and its riches. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1608.04s)]
*  This is the Orbeno Bible. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1618.04s)]
*  This is the Orbeno Bible. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1619.04s)]
*  For instance, this spectacular Bible commissioned in 1476 by the Duke of Orbeno. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1621.04s)]
*  He wanted to have a very fancy Bible. And this is what he got. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1627.04s)]
*  Library curator Timothy Janz tells us the Bible took years to make by hand, letter by letter, picture by picture. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1632.04s)]
*  Decorated with real gold. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1642.04s)]
*  It's just one of the library's 80,000 handwritten manuscripts from the ages before the printing press. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1644.04s)]
*  Add to that those two million or so printed books, Christian and pagan, sacred and profane, in virtually every language known to man. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1652.04s)]
*  There are thousands of prints and drawings, windows on the past. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1663.04s)]
*  This is a papal coin. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1670.04s)]
*  And a huge collection of ancient coins. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1671.04s)]
*  This was the money of Palestine 2,000 years ago, including the kind of silver coins Judas was said to have been paid to betray Christ. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1675.04s)]
*  Here is a map of the world drawn 50 years before Columbus. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1685.04s)]
*  At its edge, the Towers of Paradise. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1690.04s)]
*  And an immediate bestseller, Columbus's description of his voyage to the New World, published in 1493. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1692.04s)]
*  In a certain way, the library is kind of the attic of Western civilization. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1702.04s)]
*  It's so true, and it's like many attics. You know, you put things up all the time. You keep on pushing over boxes to make space for more things. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1708.04s)]
*  Father Michael Collins is an Irish priest who's written extensively about the Vatican, where the library's shelves, if you put them end to end, would stretch for 31 miles. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1715.04s)]
*  Is there anyone, any single person who really knows what the library holds? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1728.04s)]
*  Nobody knows exactly what's there, because it would be impossible for the human brain to understand, to remember the titles, who wrote it, when they were written. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1734.04s)]
*  It is quite a treasure of the humanity that you have here. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1743.04s)]
*  Monseigneur Cesari Pasini presides over the library. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1749.04s)]
*  Its great hall, essentially unchanged over the centuries, is a picture gallery of antiquity. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1754.04s)]
*  Saints, philosophers, and depictions of the great libraries of the pre-Christian world. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1761.04s)]
*  Babylon, Athens, Alexandria, a shrine to learning and to books. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1766.04s)]
*  There's one person who can actually take a book out of the library, correct? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1773.04s)]
*  Yes, the Pope can have every book in the library. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1778.04s)]
*  If St. Peter's Basilica represents the splendor of the church writ large, the library nearby is a testament to the monks and scribes who made magnificent miniatures in times past. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1784.04s)]
*  Here, some devotional music commissioned by Pope Leo X, and the text of the Christmas mass used at the altar of the Holy Sepulcher. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1797.04s)]
*  Here, some devotional music commissioned by Pope Leo X, and the text of the Christmas mass used at the altar by Alexander VI. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1809.04s)]
*  Both manuscripts, five centuries old, written on parchment, treated animal skin. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1817.04s)]
*  You will often see the skin of sheep being used, sometimes goats. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1824.04s)]
*  Christopher Celenza, director of the American Academy in Rome, is a scholar who's often used the library. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1829.04s)]
*  He says that writing on parchment was not only tedious, but expensive. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1834.04s)]
*  If a monastery wanted to produce a Bible that perhaps had 400 pages, it might cost you 400 sheep. It's an investment. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1841.04s)]
*  Beyond the academic work, did you ever just come here to hang out and flip through stuff and see what you might discover? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1851.04s)]
*  I think all of us have come here at one time or another with the hope of discovering something, having a general direction in which we're going, but not quite knowing where we'll wind up. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1860.04s)]
*  You might find, as curator Adelbert Roth showed us, drawings of a German jousting tournament in 1481. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1870.04s)]
*  Or an old cookbook telling us that Roman foodies in the 4th century dined on chicken, veal, seafood, pancakes in milk, and whipped pear cake. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1879.04s)]
*  Or from an 11th century treatise on the art of war, a Byzantine soldier brandishing a flamethrower, something the Greeks invented 1500 years earlier. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1893.04s)]
*  Or Henry VIII's love letters to Anne Boleyn. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1903.04s)]
*  The letters are certainly among the most bizarre and unusual that you'd expect to find in the Pope's archives. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1908.04s)]
*  There are 17 of them, handwritten by the King of England to the woman he would make the second of his six wives, and later have beheaded. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1915.04s)]
*  There's the little heart. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1925.04s)]
*  Henry signs his name with a heart, like a smitten schoolboy. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1926.04s)]
*  He tells of his fervence of love, his great loneliness without her, wishing myself, he says, in my sweetheart's arms, whose pretty duckies I'd trust shortly to kiss. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1931.04s)]
*  Duckies being a term in Henry's day for, well, use your imagination. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1944.04s)]
*  What is that doing in the Vatican Library? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1950.04s)]
*  We don't know how they ended up here in the Vatican. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1952.04s)]
*  It may be that some spy, maybe one of my priestly predecessors, may have stolen these letters and brought them to Rome to present in the case if a trial was made for Henry's request for divorce. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1955.04s)]
*  But the Church refused to let Henry divorce Catherine of Aragon so he could marry Anne. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1968.04s)]
*  He married her anyway, broke with Rome, and took control of the Church of England. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1975.04s)]
*  The country was largely converted to the Protestant faith. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1979.04s)]
*  This is one of the moments in the 16th century that leads to the fracturing of Christianity and to much of the bloodshed and the wars that especially the later 16th century was known for. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1983.04s)]
*  As man explored the planet, a scientific revolution was also underway. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=1999.04s)]
*  By the mid-17th century, navigators had mapped much of the world in remarkable detail. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2003.04s)]
*  Rio de Janeiro, Cusco, Mexico City. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2011.04s)]
*  Galileo turned his eyes and his telescope on the heavens. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2015.04s)]
*  Here, from 1612, are his drawings of sunspots. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2019.04s)]
*  For his insistence that the sun is the center of the universe and the Earth moves around it, Galileo was convinced that the sun was the center of the universe. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2024.04s)]
*  And so, the Church branded him a heretic. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2033.04s)]
*  The Pope at the time, Pope Urban VIII, who was a very good friend of Galileo, said to him, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2037.04s)]
*  look, you know, I agree with you, you're right, but I can't approve of this because I'm the Pope, and if I go against this, it looks as if I'm going against the Bible and I'm going to shake to the foundation the belief of the world and the world's Christians, not just Catholics. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2041.04s)]
*  Just 380 years later, in 1992, Pope John Paul II apologized for the Galileo affair. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2054.04s)]
*  His successor, Benedict XVI, has sought middle ground in the centuries-old skirmishes between the Church and science. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2068.04s)]
*  In a recent sermon, he said, even the Big Bang theory of the creation of the universe is not in conflict with faith because God's mind was behind it. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2077.04s)]
*  This is the tricky part. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2089.04s)]
*  And backstage in the Pope's library, science is brought to bear on crumbling books, as restoration workers deal with water damage, mold, and the ravages of time. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2093.04s)]
*  It seems endless, this work. Yes, obviously. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2104.04s)]
*  Angela Gaetan and the others go inch by inch, patching and strengthening ancient pages, scratching off paste put on by well-meaning restorers centuries ago. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2109.04s)]
*  Paste that's turning acid, eating away at the page. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2120.04s)]
*  Mario Tabertzi seldom reads what he's repairing. It's too distracting, especially if the writer happens to be Michelangelo. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2125.04s)]
*  When I worked on the Michelangelo paper, it was the same as working on Mickey Mouse paper. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2134.04s)]
*  Mickey Mouse, huh? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2142.04s)]
*  A difficult job may take months or even years, but consider the result. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2145.04s)]
*  One thousand years after us, I hope that they can read the same thing that we are reading now. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2151.04s)]
*  The library's most valued documents go back almost two thousand years, nearly to the time of St. Peter, the first pope whose tomb lies beneath the basilica that bears his name. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2157.04s)]
*  His letters to the faithful make up two books of the New Testament. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2173.04s)]
*  And here is a copy written in Greek on papyrus by one of Peter's disciples around the year 200, a mere century or so after his death. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2179.04s)]
*  In the beginning, it was the word, and the word was God. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2191.04s)]
*  And from the same period, the Gospel of Luke and part of the Gospel of John, also written on papyrus, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2195.04s)]
*  venerated by early Christians in Egypt, preserved for centuries in a desert monastery. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2203.04s)]
*  They contain the oldest known copy of the Lord's Prayer, so fragile we were only allowed to see replicas. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2213.04s)]
*  It is the most important treasure of Christianity. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2224.04s)]
*  With our tour nearly over, it seemed as if the library's collection had come to life in the streets of the Eternal City. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2228.04s)]
*  The centurions and crusaders, the centuries of faith and folly, time present and time past. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2237.04s)]
*  Leaving the library, we thought there's something, something almost magical to be immersed in this place, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2244.04s)]
*  to breathe the air and touch the hand of history. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2252.04s)]
*  The Eiger in the Swiss Alps is one of the most forbidding mountains in the world. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2256.04s)]
*  Locals call it the Ogre, and for more than a century, this monster of a mountain has attracted thrill-seekers eager to risk their lives on its nearly vertical slopes. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2272.04s)]
*  More than 60 climbers have frozen or fallen to their deaths. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2281.04s)]
*  Now, a new breed of daredevil is taking on the Eiger, not by climbing up the mountain, but by plunging down it. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2286.04s)]
*  When we heard that after years of planning, a new kind of descent was about to be attempted, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2293.04s)]
*  we went to Switzerland to see firsthand something no one had ever tried before. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2298.04s)]
*  At 13,000 feet, the icy summit of the Eiger is too steep and rocky to simply ski down. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2303.04s)]
*  You ready? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2313.04s)]
*  So JT Holmes is training in three extreme sports to rocket down more of the Eiger than anyone ever has. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2315.04s)]
*  Right now, he's practicing one of those sports, speed riding, on a nearby mountain slope with his friend and cameraman, Valentin DeLoupe. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2324.04s)]
*  To speed ride, JT is using skis, but he's also attached to a glider-like parachute called a SpeedWing. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2334.04s)]
*  It allows him to soar over rocks and ledges impossible to ski. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2342.04s)]
*  You're capable of transitioning in and out of flight at will. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2348.04s)]
*  So you're both skiing and then you're flying. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2351.04s)]
*  And then you're skiing a little bit more. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2354.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2357.04s)]
*  But speed riding will only take JT so far down the Eiger. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2359.04s)]
*  He'll also ski off a cliff and then free fall the rest of the way, all in one long, nonstop, breathtaking ride. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2363.04s)]
*  Three sports, one run. And they're my three favorite sports. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2371.04s)]
*  These are the three things you love? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2377.04s)]
*  Yeah, these are three of the things that I love. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2378.04s)]
*  JT needs perfect conditions for this dangerous descent, and so far he hasn't been lucky. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2382.04s)]
*  Weather on the Eiger is unpredictable. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2389.04s)]
*  Fierce winds whip the slopes and change direction dramatically. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2392.04s)]
*  JT checks the Eiger every day to see if he can finally head to the summit. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2397.04s)]
*  The past two years he's had to cancel plans because wind blew the snow off the top of the mountain. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2401.04s)]
*  Today the conditions are not right. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2408.04s)]
*  Well, yeah, today you can't even see the top of the Eiger. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2410.04s)]
*  So first of all, you couldn't land a helicopter up there. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2413.04s)]
*  How long have you been planning this? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2415.04s)]
*  You know, first kind of thoughts of it were upwards of six years ago, but really focused on it for three. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2417.04s)]
*  Why has it taken so long? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2424.04s)]
*  You put your life in unnecessary risk. So I need the right day. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2426.04s)]
*  JT is well aware of the risk. He started out as a professional skier. The steeper the slope, the better. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2431.04s)]
*  Ready, set, go! [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2439.04s)]
*  Now at 35 he makes a living through endorsements and filming his remarkable feats. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2442.04s)]
*  When we first met him six years ago in Norway, he and his daredevil friends were pioneering the use of wingsuits, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2447.04s)]
*  jumping off mountains and flying at more than 100 miles an hour. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2454.04s)]
*  But in the last several years, a number of JT's friends and acquaintances have died in wingsuit accidents. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2457.04s)]
*  Ilev Rude, who was flying with JT in Norway, was killed in 2012 when he struck a cliff and fell a thousand feet. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2464.04s)]
*  JT won't be wingsuit flying off the Eiger. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2474.04s)]
*  The most dangerous part of his descent will be after he finishes speed riding, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2477.04s)]
*  when he tries to jettison his skis and free fall down the rest of the mountain. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2481.04s)]
*  To practice, he makes base jumps without skis off a tiny slippery piece of rock he calls the mushroom. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2486.04s)]
*  I stepped off the helicopter onto the mushroom and that was fine. I had good grip. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2494.04s)]
*  But then I took another step and there was this really thin ice layer. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2501.04s)]
*  It feels more uneven than I remember it. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2505.04s)]
*  He's off. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2508.04s)]
*  He falls for about 20 seconds, accelerating to 110 miles an hour before opening his parachute. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2512.04s)]
*  He's strutting right toward us. The parachute's open. It's a white parachute. He's red. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2523.04s)]
*  That was amazing. How was it? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2532.04s)]
*  Scary. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2535.04s)]
*  As JT jumps off the cliff on the Eiger, he'll have his skis on. Properly releasing them is critical. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2536.04s)]
*  What's the danger if you can't get the skis off? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2543.04s)]
*  You're at risk of an unstable parachute deployment or a snag. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2546.04s)]
*  So the biggest danger is that the ski is going to get tangled up in the parachute? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2549.04s)]
*  That's the risk. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2553.04s)]
*  That risk is foremost in his mind because of what happened to his best friend, Shane McConkie. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2555.04s)]
*  In 2007, JT and Shane started skiing off mountains, dropping their skis, and then flying away in wingsuits. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2559.04s)]
*  It was a dangerous combination they found thrilling. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2568.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, another wingsuit ski base. Here we go. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2572.04s)]
*  But on this jump in Italy in 2009, Shane McConkie's ski release mechanism jammed. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2576.04s)]
*  He couldn't get his skis to come off. He crashed into the ground at high speed and was killed instantly. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2582.04s)]
*  That's how he died. His skis didn't come off. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2589.04s)]
*  He couldn't get his skis off, struggled in his wingsuit, and crashed. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2592.04s)]
*  When JT is training at the Eiger, he wears a t-shirt with a funny picture of Shane on it. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2597.04s)]
*  This Eiger descent. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2603.04s)]
*  Without his old friend there to help him, he's turned to new friends. Martin Sherman is an experienced Swiss mountain guide. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2605.04s)]
*  It can change very quickly, from good conditions to really nasty. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2612.04s)]
*  It can turn bad very quickly. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2617.04s)]
*  And then you're in trouble. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2619.04s)]
*  One wrong step and you can plunge off. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2621.04s)]
*  You're gone. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2623.04s)]
*  Martin and JT are cautious and methodical, making numerous trips of the Eiger to plan in advance every part of the complex descent. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2625.04s)]
*  Particularly this spot where JT will jump, jettison his skis, and begin to free fall. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2633.04s)]
*  You're standing there on the top of the mountain. What goes through your mind? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2639.04s)]
*  There's two mindsets. There's the evil Knievel, which is kind of kamikaze, and who knows how it's going to work out, and will you hit the landing ramp or not. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2642.04s)]
*  And then there's the James Bond. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2651.04s)]
*  And Bond is composed and dialed, and he uses clever pieces of gear, which he developed with Q to outwit his opponents and pull off tremendous things. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2653.04s)]
*  Which one are you? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2665.04s)]
*  I'm Bond. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2667.04s)]
*  After days of waiting and years of false starts and cancelled attempts, on this visit in April, the weather on the mountain suddenly clears. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2669.04s)]
*  JT decides the time is right. He and his team take a chopper to the Eiger summit. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2679.04s)]
*  I'm checking for landmarks on the way up and kind of confirming my line, my path of descent. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2685.04s)]
*  So you already have a path of descent in your mind? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2690.04s)]
*  It's something that's been memorized. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2693.04s)]
*  The Eiger may be a monster of a mountain, but up close, the summit is shockingly small. Here, there is no room for error. No room for the helicopter. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2696.04s)]
*  It's not big enough for the helicopter to actually land. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2707.04s)]
*  It does what we call a tow-in, where it just puts its nose into the Eiger and it just hovers there. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2710.04s)]
*  How big is the area that you're standing on at the top? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2715.04s)]
*  The top of the Eiger is pretty small. There is no flat spot. Workable space is three ping pong tables. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2718.04s)]
*  Three ping pong tables. That's it. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2726.04s)]
*  Something like that, yeah. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2728.04s)]
*  A mistake here, one wrong step at 13,000 feet, could cost them their lives. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2730.04s)]
*  JT and his team work for almost an hour. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2737.04s)]
*  Wearing crampons on their ski boots, they dig trenches with ice axes so they won't fall down the nearly vertical slope. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2739.04s)]
*  The surface is jagged ice, not powdery snow, and it can easily rip the speed wings. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2746.04s)]
*  I don't like how these things grab the lines. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2752.04s)]
*  They file down the sharp pieces of ice so they won't snag the speed wing lines. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2755.04s)]
*  But the wind kicks up and they have to quickly reposition them. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2760.04s)]
*  JT decides it's now or never. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2763.04s)]
*  Okay, you're good? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2766.04s)]
*  Okay, three, two, one, go! [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2768.04s)]
*  JT launches off the summit. Champion speed rider Valentin DeLoup quickly follows, videotaping for us with a camera on his helmet. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2771.04s)]
*  The ride of a lifetime has begun. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2780.04s)]
*  That's when you turn your skis downhill. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2785.04s)]
*  That's when you turn your skis downhill. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2789.04s)]
*  Doing that, that's very committing because when you point your skis down the Eiger, you're probably not going to stop until the bottom. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2793.04s)]
*  One way or the other? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2800.04s)]
*  One way or the other. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2802.04s)]
*  JT uses the speed wing for much of the descent, flying over outcroppings of rock and icy slopes too steep to ski. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2805.04s)]
*  He reaches an open slope on the Eiger's western flank and lands. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2812.04s)]
*  He cuts loose his speed wing so it won't slow him down. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2817.04s)]
*  Now he relies solely on his skis and skill. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2821.04s)]
*  It's black diamond skiing. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2825.04s)]
*  You're in a really cool place where a few people have skied. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2827.04s)]
*  Really what you're going to try to do is just gather as much speed as possible and just propel yourself off the cliff. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2830.04s)]
*  The cliff he'll ski off is coming up on the summit. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2836.04s)]
*  This is the most dangerous part of JT's descent. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2839.04s)]
*  There is no stopping. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2843.04s)]
*  He completes a double backflip to stabilize himself, releases his skis, then free falls. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2845.04s)]
*  His nylon suit is aerodynamically designed, propelling him forward so he doesn't crash into any rock ledges. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2854.04s)]
*  He falls nearly 2,000 feet, finally opening up to the top. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2862.04s)]
*  He falls nearly 2,000 feet, finally opening his parachute. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2866.04s)]
*  He drifts safely to the ground, landing more than a mile below the Eiger's summit. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2879.04s)]
*  Oh my god. That was pretty intense, man. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2891.04s)]
*  Nailed it. Nailed it. Nailed it. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2894.04s)]
*  I don't have words to describe how it felt to go and pull that off after so much time. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2898.04s)]
*  You know, it's kind of a twisted style of having fun, but it was really fun. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2904.04s)]
*  If you're too fast, it's a little just kind of scary. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2910.04s)]
*  We assumed JT would call it a day after making it down the Eiger in one piece. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2913.04s)]
*  But after catching his breath and repacking his equipment, he decides to head back to the summit and do the whole run down the mountain once again. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2918.04s)]
*  Three, two, one, go. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2927.04s)]
*  His speed ride off the summit goes perfectly. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2931.04s)]
*  He flies over trouble spots and builds up speed as he approaches the cliff edge. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2936.04s)]
*  But when he tries to release his skis, one of them won't come off. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2947.04s)]
*  This is what killed his best friend Shane McConkey. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2952.04s)]
*  JT struggles for several agonizing seconds, then finally manages to drop the ski. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2955.04s)]
*  It's a close call, but it doesn't seem to stop him from enjoying the rest of the ride. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2967.04s)]
*  Could you give it up? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2973.04s)]
*  I believe that I could, because I don't feel that I'm addicted to this sort of adrenaline or this sort of high risk activity. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2974.04s)]
*  You're not an adrenaline junkie, you don't think? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2986.04s)]
*  Absolutely not. I prefer adrenaline enthusiasts. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2988.04s)]
*  I truly believe that I don't have to do this, and I truly believe that I enjoy doing this. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2990.04s)]
*  That's pretty clear. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=2999.04s)]
*  I think the day will come when I tone it down significantly. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=3000.04s)]
*  But that day's not here yet. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=3005.04s)]
*  It's not today. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mash2sLzM1I&t=3007.04s)]
