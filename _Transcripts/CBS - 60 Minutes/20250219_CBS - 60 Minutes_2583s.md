# 28 Days;  Policing the Internet; Timothée Chalamet | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg)
*  It's too soon to tell how serious President Trump is in defiance of the Constitution, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=0.0s)]
*  but in just 28 days, he's reinterpreted the 14th Amendment and closed agencies that Congress [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=12.76s)]
*  mandated by law. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=20.16s)]
*  The president says he has the authority to shut down an independent agency like USAID. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=22.64s)]
*  He most definitely does not. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=28.44s)]
*  While America is relaxing policies around social media and the internet, Germany is [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  cracking down. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=39.0s)]
*  We were with the German police as they conducted early morning raids on citizens who'd been [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  accused of hate speech, threats and inciting violence online. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=47.52s)]
*  In the United States, a lot of people look at this and say this is restricting free [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=52.32s)]
*  speech. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=56.2s)]
*  It's a threat to democracy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=57.2s)]
*  Free speech needs boundaries. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=58.56s)]
*  Timothee Chalamet pre-recorded all the Dylan songs he'd sing in the movie. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=69.28s)]
*  They were supposed to be played back on set during filming. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=73.32s)]
*  It always sounded too clean. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=76.28s)]
*  The recording equipment's too clean now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=78.28s)]
*  The guitars are too good. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=79.68s)]
*  Bob Dylan was drinking two bottles of red wine a day, sometimes smoking 30 packs of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=82.08s)]
*  Did you drink two bottles of wine and smoke 30 packs of anything like it? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=85.48s)]
*  The smoking I did, the wine I held back on more. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=88.48s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=94.04s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=98.16s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=100.84s)]
*  I'm Nora O'Donnell. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=103.48s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  It's too soon to tell how serious President Trump is in defiance of the Constitution. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=116.48s)]
*  In his first 28 days, he signed an order to nullify birthright citizenship for some, a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, and he has closed agencies and frozen spending [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=129.24s)]
*  that Congress mandated by law. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  Lower courts are holding up many of the President's priorities, but nothing has risen to the Supreme [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=139.16s)]
*  Court where these battles over presidential power could rewrite history. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=144.08s)]
*  Presidents often push limits, FDR's New Deal, for example, and voters in this last election [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  wanted change. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=156.68s)]
*  But the scope and speed of Trump's reach for power may be unprecedented. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=158.56s)]
*  One example is a 63-year-old agency created by Congress, codified in law, and eviscerated [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=164.28s)]
*  by Trump in a matter of days. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=172.42s)]
*  People are really scared. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=176.66s)]
*  I think that, you know, 12 days ago people knew where their next paycheck was coming [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  from. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=182.54s)]
*  They knew how they were going to pay for their kids' daycare, their medical bills, and then [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=183.54s)]
*  all gone overnight. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=188.5s)]
*  All gone overnight for Christina Dry and Adam Dubard, fired this month in the chaotic shutdown [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  of foreign aid distributed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  More than 8,000 USAID employees were sent home by the administration. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=206.22s)]
*  They're not looking for competency, they're not looking for if you're good at your job, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=213.06s)]
*  they're looking for pure loyalty tests, and if you don't give it, you will be punished. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=216.22s)]
*  And they had to leave the building. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=221.38s)]
*  And these are folks who had decades and decades of public service serving USAID across administrations, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=223.86s)]
*  from, you know, George Bush to Obama to the first Trump administration, and they were [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  never able to walk back in the building again. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=236.68s)]
*  There was no process, no one explained to them why they were being relieved. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=238.66000000000003s)]
*  To my knowledge, they received an email, and then if they didn't leave the building, they [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=243.34s)]
*  were escorted out of the building. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=247.14000000000001s)]
*  USAID was dismantled on Trump's order, even though it was mandated by Congress and its [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=249.26s)]
*  funding was required by law. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=256.54s)]
*  The president says he has the authority to shut down an independent agency like USAID. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=259.18s)]
*  He most definitely does not. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=264.98s)]
*  Andrew Natsios is a former member of the Republican National Committee. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=267.38s)]
*  He's a professor of government at Texas A&M University, and in the Bush White House, he [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=272.26s)]
*  was administrator of USAID. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=278.21999999999997s)]
*  He cannot rescind federal law by executive order, and AID is a statutory agency. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=281.65999999999997s)]
*  The Foreign Assistance Act, I believe, is 300 or 400 pages long. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=288.06s)]
*  You can't rescind that without an act of the Congress, and the Congress has not acted. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=291.97999999999996s)]
*  Acting on his own, the president started by destroying USAID's image. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=298.34s)]
*  In online posts, the administration smeared USAID as, quote, a criminal organization, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=305.65999999999997s)]
*  and called employees worms. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=313.06s)]
*  USAID, it's a disaster. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=316.06s)]
*  The people radical left lunatics. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=320.34s)]
*  About USAID, President Trump has said, quote, billions of dollars have been stolen. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=323.02s)]
*  The whole thing is a fraud. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=330.17999999999995s)]
*  It's utter nonsense. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=333.26s)]
*  The most accountable aid agency in the world is USAID. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=335.06s)]
*  I've written actually widely on this subject. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=338.18s)]
*  Forty percent of the staff are accountants and lawyers and people trying to make sure [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=340.9s)]
*  no money is stolen. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=345.18s)]
*  We've created systems to monitor that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=347.3s)]
*  What they did was they went back 20 years to try to find things. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=349.96s)]
*  If you have to go back 20 years to find abuse, that means there isn't that much abuse. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=354.14s)]
*  USAID's spending in 2023 was $38 billion. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=359.38s)]
*  That's less than 1% of the federal budget. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=363.58000000000004s)]
*  Natsios told us there is waste and occasional fraud like any big agency. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=366.98s)]
*  Think of the Pentagon. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=372.70000000000005s)]
*  But the money, he says, is watched by officials, including those in the OMB, the Office of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=374.20000000000005s)]
*  Management and Budget. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  The question is, why did the Congress approve all these contracts and grants and programs [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=381.76s)]
*  all these years? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=387.54s)]
*  Why did OMB approve them? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=388.78s)]
*  Why did the State Department, F Office, the F Office controls all foreign aid spending? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=390.61999999999995s)]
*  Every line item in the USAID budget is approved by three different bodies, the F Office, OMB, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=395.26s)]
*  and the Congressional Oversight Committees, of which there are four. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=401.94s)]
*  No one caught all these horrible abuses. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=405.47999999999996s)]
*  That's just not believable. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=409.53999999999996s)]
*  Instead of asking Congress to change the law, Trump handed the budget acts to billionaire [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=411.5s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=417.34s)]
*  Musk is racing through the government, cutting jobs and budgets with his own newly created [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=419.02s)]
*  organization. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=424.9s)]
*  He calls DOJ, or the Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=426.17999999999995s)]
*  The people voted for major government reform, there should be no doubt about that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=431.53999999999996s)]
*  DOJ was authorized by Trump. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=437.82s)]
*  And beginning in January, DOJ engineers rapidly gained wide access to the computer networks [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=440.46s)]
*  of the U.S. Treasury. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=446.9s)]
*  A longtime Treasury official who tried to stop them was put on leave. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=448.78s)]
*  Now DOJ has accessed at least 19 other agencies. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=453.94s)]
*  You're principally reporting on what's happened to USAID. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=459.54s)]
*  It's a dress rehearsal. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=462.94s)]
*  Chris Coons is a Democratic Senator from Delaware, a member of the Committees on Appropriations [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=464.5s)]
*  and Foreign Relations. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=470.7s)]
*  Next up is the Department of Education. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=472.74s)]
*  They're going to take it down next. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=474.62s)]
*  They're already talking about getting into and going after the Department of Labor, the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=476.38s)]
*  Veterans Administration, the Department of Defense, the Social Security Administration. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=480.54s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=485.54s)]
*  Do you believe you have a sense of what DOJ is doing? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=486.54s)]
*  No. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=489.98s)]
*  I think DOJ is an unelected, unofficial, small group of young tech bros who are charging [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=490.98s)]
*  into different federal agencies, getting into their core computer systems, doing things [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=497.74s)]
*  with them that at least I don't know the full details of, copying and downloading reams [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=503.5s)]
*  of data. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=508.62s)]
*  What does it matter that DOJ has access to U.S. government computer systems? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=509.94s)]
*  What matters is that the U.S. government has information about you, about me, our Social [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=514.98s)]
*  Security information, our Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Benefit payments, things that matter [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=519.86s)]
*  to us, obviously our tax filings. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=525.1800000000001s)]
*  And if they have access to it and control it, they can change it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=527.82s)]
*  DOJ demanded and received total control of USAID's unclassified computer network, including [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=533.02s)]
*  all financial and personnel files. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=541.22s)]
*  One USAID employee told us that a DOJ engineer used the computer to give himself access to [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=544.9s)]
*  classified spaces in the building. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=553.3s)]
*  That USAID employee told us they didn't know that the DOJ engineer entered those spaces. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=556.82s)]
*  But the employee said that is the problem with all of this. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=563.34s)]
*  We don't know what's been compromised. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=567.22s)]
*  What are they going to do with the information? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=570.46s)]
*  We don't know who these people are. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=573.22s)]
*  We don't know what controls have been placed on the information. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=574.7800000000001s)]
*  Randy Chester has worked for USAID 21 years under four presidents, two Democrats, two [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=577.62s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=584.74s)]
*  He represents the agency workforce for the American Foreign Service Association. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=586.46s)]
*  DOJ arrived at USAID January 27th and that same day USAID's top 58 managers were given [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=592.9000000000001s)]
*  45 minutes to get out. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=604.3000000000001s)]
*  The 58 senior managers, how would you describe them? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=606.82s)]
*  They're the best professionals I've had the privilege to work with or work under. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=612.94s)]
*  Their integrity is without question. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=619.1800000000001s)]
*  I think to a person they believe in the mission of USAID and they believe in the ideals of [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=621.74s)]
*  public service. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=627.3800000000001s)]
*  USAID's signage was hastily covered in what employees saw as a gleeful put down. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=628.7800000000001s)]
*  But this past week there was a partial reprieve. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=636.1800000000001s)]
*  A judge temporarily restored funds to USAID's partners working overseas. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=640.34s)]
*  Already at least 67 lawsuits have been filed against the new administration. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=647.7s)]
*  In the Oval Office with Musk, Trump said quote, I always abide by the courts. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=653.6600000000001s)]
*  But he also said this. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=660.7800000000001s)]
*  We want to weed out the corruption and it seems hard to believe that a judge could say [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=663.0600000000001s)]
*  we don't want you to do that. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=667.62s)]
*  So maybe we have to look at the judges because that's a very serious, I think it's a very [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=670.4200000000001s)]
*  serious violation. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=674.74s)]
*  We've seen flash points in these fights before. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=676.82s)]
*  We've never seen this fight unfold across such a broad front and at such a basic level [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=679.58s)]
*  where a president is claiming so much of Congress's constitutional powers. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=685.1s)]
*  Stephen Vladeck is a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University Law Center. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=689.5s)]
*  Fraud doesn't negate statutes that Congress has enacted. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=696.46s)]
*  Fraud just provides an excuse for revisiting them. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=699.7s)]
*  And so the problem is that you see these claims of fraud by President Trump, by Elon Musk, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=702.4200000000001s)]
*  that really feel like they're fig leafs. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=706.94s)]
*  If it's a fig leaf, what are they covering up? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=709.4200000000001s)]
*  I think what we're really seeing is a consolidation of power. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=711.86s)]
*  And so fraud provides a plausible sounding reason for running over what had been historical [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=715.3000000000001s)]
*  constraints whether they were statutes or norms, limiting the president's ability to [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=721.1s)]
*  centralize power. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=724.94s)]
*  The end game here seems to be controlling every single apparatus of the federal government [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=726.9000000000001s)]
*  directly out of the White House. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=731.62s)]
*  And that's just never been how we've understood executive power. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=732.62s)]
*  In your view, what would the founders think of where we are today? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=736.46s)]
*  I mean, the founders were they, not it. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=739.82s)]
*  Even James Madison changed his mind about 17 times between when he wrote the Constitution [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=743.0200000000001s)]
*  and when he was president. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=747.2600000000001s)]
*  So I think it's hard to generalize. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=748.46s)]
*  I do think the founders would be very worried about just how much the tension that I think [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=749.86s)]
*  they thought they were creating among the branches has broken down. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=756.46s)]
*  I mean, the idea is that we want a zealous executive. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=759.6600000000001s)]
*  We want a zealous Congress. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=762.74s)]
*  We want a zealous courts because if they push at each other, that's how we'll find the limits. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=764.7s)]
*  That's how we'll ensure that there's healthy checks and balances. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=769.2600000000001s)]
*  But I think we can no longer dispute that Congress, which is supposed to be providing [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=772.0200000000001s)]
*  rigorous oversight of the executive branch, which is supposed to be reining in abuses [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=776.54s)]
*  by the executive branch, by the courts too, has largely stopped doing any of that. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=780.5799999999999s)]
*  Neither Elon Musk nor Doge responded to our request for an interview. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=785.9s)]
*  It was Musk who called USAID employees worms. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=791.42s)]
*  In a post, he gloated about feeding the agency into the woodchipper. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=796.3399999999999s)]
*  The world's richest man had cut off assistance to the world's poorest families. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=801.42s)]
*  Musk spent nearly $250 million to get Trump and other Republicans elected. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=807.9799999999999s)]
*  He collects billions in taxpayer dollars for his SpaceX rockets. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=813.6999999999999s)]
*  I think we're creating a system that violates the separation of powers and the checks and [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=819.74s)]
*  balances that are intended in the Constitution. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=825.26s)]
*  Even Andrew Nazios, former head of USAID, spoke to us in Washington in part because [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=829.06s)]
*  he is not hearing public appeals to reason from fellow Republicans. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=836.42s)]
*  I am not a moderate Republican. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=842.42s)]
*  I am a conservative Republican and a strict constructionist. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=844.18s)]
*  The reason they're not saying anything, I think they're afraid. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=849.14s)]
*  Musk has said that he would spend $100 million in primaries on anybody who opposed the president [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=851.66s)]
*  on anything. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=856.9399999999999s)]
*  So I think there's a lot of fear in the city right now. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=857.98s)]
*  How do you view this moment in history? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=860.98s)]
*  I don't want to be too pessimistic, but it does appear we may be headed towards some [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=865.5s)]
*  sort of a Constitutional crisis. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=873.54s)]
*  I hope that doesn't happen. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=876.9s)]
*  I pray it doesn't happen, but it's certainly concerning to me what's going on in the city [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=878.86s)]
*  right now. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=883.54s)]
*  Is the Constitutional order breaking down? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=884.66s)]
*  We'll see if they refuse to enforce a court order by the Supreme Court. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=887.5s)]
*  If it gets to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court rules against the administration on [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=892.98s)]
*  something and they refuse to enforce it, then we will have a Constitutional crisis. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=897.5799999999999s)]
*  What happens then? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=901.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=902.6999999999999s)]
*  No one knows. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=904.5s)]
*  No one knows. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=905.5s)]
*  If you've ever dared to read the comments on a social media post, you might start to [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=915.02s)]
*  wonder if civilized discourse is just a myth. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=920.06s)]
*  Aggressive threats, lies, and harassment have unfortunately become the norm online, where [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=924.2199999999999s)]
*  anonymity has emboldened some users to push the limits of civility. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=930.26s)]
*  In the United States, most of what anyone says, sends, or streams online, even if it's [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=935.3399999999999s)]
*  hate-filled or toxic, is protected by the First Amendment as free speech. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=940.86s)]
*  But Germany is trying to bring some civility to the World Wide Web by policing it in a [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=946.66s)]
*  way most Americans could never imagine. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=951.86s)]
*  In an effort, it says, to protect discourse, German authorities have started prosecuting [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=955.22s)]
*  online trolls. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=960.74s)]
*  And as we saw, it often begins with a pre-dawn wake-up call from the police. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=962.54s)]
*  It's 6.01 on a Tuesday morning, and we were with state police as they raided this apartment [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=969.06s)]
*  in northwest Germany. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=976.9799999999999s)]
*  Inside, six armed officers searched a suspect's home, then seized his laptop and cell phone. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=981.4599999999999s)]
*  Prosecutors say those electronics may have been used to commit a crime. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=989.02s)]
*  The crime? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=993.66s)]
*  Posting a racist cartoon online. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=994.66s)]
*  At the exact same time across Germany, more than 50 similar raids played out. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=999.06s)]
*  Part of what prosecutors say is a coordinated effort to curb online hate speech in Germany. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1006.8599999999999s)]
*  What's the typical reaction when the police show up at somebody's door and they say, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1013.4599999999999s)]
*  hey, we believe you wrote this on the internet? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1018.4599999999999s)]
*  They say, in Germany we say, das wird man wohl nochmal sagen dürfen. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1021.66s)]
*  So we are here with crimes of talking, posting on the internet, and the people are surprised [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1026.06s)]
*  that this is really illegal to post these kind of words. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1031.6599999999999s)]
*  They don't think it was illegal? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1036.86s)]
*  No, they don't think it was illegal. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1037.86s)]
*  And they say, no, that's my free speech. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1040.06s)]
*  And we say, no, yeah, free speech as well, but it also has its limits. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1042.26s)]
*  Interpreting those limits is part of the job for Dr. Matthias Fink, Svenia Mininghaus, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1047.46s)]
*  and Frank-Mihai El Lau, a few of the state prosecutors tasked with policing Germany's [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1052.96s)]
*  robust hate speech laws online. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1058.56s)]
*  After its darkest chapter, Germany strengthened its speech laws. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1064.3600000000001s)]
*  As prosecutors explain it, the German constitution protects free speech, but not hate speech. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1068.56s)]
*  And here's where it gets tricky. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1075.16s)]
*  German law prohibits any speech that could incite hatred or is deemed insulting. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1077.06s)]
*  It's illegal to display Nazi symbolism, a swastika, or deny the Holocaust. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1082.76s)]
*  That's clear. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1088.36s)]
*  Is it a crime to insult somebody in public? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1089.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1092.36s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1093.36s)]
*  And it's a crime to insult them online as well? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1094.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1096.36s)]
*  The fine could be even higher if you insult someone in the internet. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1097.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1102.36s)]
*  Because in internet it stays there. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1103.36s)]
*  If we are talking face to face, you insult me, I insult you, okay, finish. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1106.36s)]
*  But if you're in the internet, if I insult you or a politician... [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1110.36s)]
*  It sticks around forever. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1113.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1115.36s)]
*  The prosecutors explain German law also prohibits the spread of malicious gossip, violent threats, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1116.36s)]
*  and fake quotes. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1123.36s)]
*  If somebody posts something that's not true, and then somebody else reposts it or likes [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1124.36s)]
*  it, are they committing a crime? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1131.36s)]
*  In the case of reposting, it is a crime as well because the reader can't distinguish [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1133.36s)]
*  whether you just invented this or just reposted it. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1138.36s)]
*  That's the same for us. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1141.36s)]
*  The punishment for breaking hate speech laws can include jail time for repeat offenders. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1143.36s)]
*  But in most cases, a judge levies a stiff fine and sometimes keeps their devices. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1148.36s)]
*  How do people react when you take their phones from them? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1155.36s)]
*  They are shocked. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1158.36s)]
*  It's a kind of punishment if you lose your smartphone. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1160.36s)]
*  It's even worse than the fine you have to pay. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1163.36s)]
*  Because your whole life is typically on your phone now. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1166.36s)]
*  The application of Germany's decades-old speech laws to the online world was accelerated [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1169.36s)]
*  after an assassination, fueled by the internet, sent shockwaves through the country. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1175.36s)]
*  In 2015, a video of a local politician named Walter Lubke went viral after he defended [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1181.36s)]
*  then-Chancellor Angela Merkel's progressive immigration policy. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1188.36s)]
*  People with a very right political worldview. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1192.36s)]
*  They started hating him on the internet. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1195.36s)]
*  They started insulting him. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1198.36s)]
*  They started to incite people to kill him. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1200.36s)]
*  And that went on for about four years. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1204.36s)]
*  Online? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1206.36s)]
*  Yes, until in 2019, so four years after he gave that speech, he was shot in his head [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1207.36s)]
*  and instantly dead. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1213.36s)]
*  So that was one of the cases where we see that online hate can sometimes find a way [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1215.36s)]
*  into real life and then hurt people. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1221.36s)]
*  After a man with links to neo-Nazis was arrested, Germany ramped up the creation [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1225.36s)]
*  of its online hate task forces. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1230.36s)]
*  There are 16 units across the country, each with a team of investigators. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1233.36s)]
*  Frank Mihai El Lau, a career criminal prosecutor, leads the Lower Saxony Unit. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1238.36s)]
*  How many cases are you working on at any time? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1244.36s)]
*  In our unit, we have about 3,500 cases per year. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1248.36s)]
*  Nine investigators work out of this office in a converted courthouse. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1253.36s)]
*  Lau says they get hundreds of tips a month from police, watchdog groups and victims. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1258.36s)]
*  You must see a lot of crazy stuff. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1263.36s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1265.36s)]
*  The worst of the internet is wrapped in red case folders, stuffed with printouts of online [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1266.36s)]
*  slurs, threats and hate. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1271.36s)]
*  This is a criminal offence. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1274.36s)]
*  What does that say? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1276.36s)]
*  Kletterpark vor Flüchtlinger. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1277.36s)]
*  So they're suggesting that the refugee children play in the electrical wires. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1279.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1283.36s)]
*  In this case, the accused had to pay 3,750 euros. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1284.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1289.36s)]
*  It's not a parking ticket. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1290.36s)]
*  Yeah, not a parking ticket. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1291.36s)]
*  To build their cases, investigators scour social media and use public and government data. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1292.36s)]
*  Lau says sometimes social media companies will provide information to prosecutors, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1298.36s)]
*  but not always. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1303.36s)]
*  So the task force employs special software investigators to help unmask anonymous users. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1304.36s)]
*  So this is suggesting you kill people seeking asylum here. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1311.36s)]
*  Lau says his unit has successfully prosecuted about 750 hate speech cases over the last [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1314.36s)]
*  four years. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1321.36s)]
*  But it was a 2021 case involving a local politician named Andy Groot that captured [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1322.36s)]
*  the country's attention. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1328.36s)]
*  Groot complained about a tweet that called him a pimmel, a German word for the male anatomy. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1330.36s)]
*  That triggered a police raid and accusations of excessive censorship by the government. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1336.36s)]
*  As prosecutors explained to us in Germany, it's okay to debate politics online, but it [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1342.36s)]
*  can be a crime to call anyone a pimmel, even a politician. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1348.36s)]
*  So it sounds like you're saying it's okay to criticize a politician's policy, but not [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1353.36s)]
*  to say, I think you're a jerk and an idiot. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1360.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1364.36s)]
*  Commands like you're son of a bitch, excuse me, for using, but these words have nothing [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1365.36s)]
*  to do with political discussions or a contribution to a discussion. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1369.36s)]
*  Civility is more than a commandment. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1375.36s)]
*  For Germans, rules are gospel. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1377.36s)]
*  Even on a quiet street, the crosswalk signal is adhered to with the devotion of a monk. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1380.36s)]
*  But some here worry by policing the internet, Germany is backsliding. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1386.36s)]
*  The criticism that, you know, this feels like the surveillance that Germany conducted 80 [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1392.36s)]
*  years ago. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1396.36s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1397.36s)]
*  There is no surveillance. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1399.36s)]
*  Josefine Ballon is a CEO of Hate Aid, a Berlin based human rights organization that supports [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1400.36s)]
*  victims of online violence. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1407.36s)]
*  In the United States, a lot of people look at this and say, this is restricting free [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1409.36s)]
*  speech. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1413.36s)]
*  It's a threat to democracy. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1414.36s)]
*  Free speech needs boundaries. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1415.36s)]
*  And in the case of Germany, these boundaries are part of our constitution. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1420.36s)]
*  Without boundaries, a very small group of people can rely on endless freedom to say [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1425.36s)]
*  anything that they want while everyone else is scared and intimidated. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1432.36s)]
*  And your fear is that if people are freely attacked online, that they'll withdraw from [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1437.36s)]
*  the discussion. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1444.36s)]
*  This is not only a fear, it's already taking place. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1445.36s)]
*  Already half of the internet users in Germany are afraid to express their political opinion, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1447.36s)]
*  and they rarely participate in public debates online anymore. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1453.36s)]
*  Half of the internet users. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1457.36s)]
*  We know hate speech is becoming. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1458.36s)]
*  Renate Kuhnast is a prominent German politician. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1460.36s)]
*  In 2015, this meme of the Green Party member appeared on Facebook, falsely implying that [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1463.36s)]
*  she said every German should learn Turkish. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1469.36s)]
*  You never said that. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1472.36s)]
*  I never said that. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1473.36s)]
*  And this harms my reputation because people think she's a bit crazy, Kaush. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1475.36s)]
*  How can she say that? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1480.36s)]
*  Kuhnast, a 40-year politician, says she began receiving threats and hate-filled comments [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1482.36s)]
*  from anonymous users online. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1488.36s)]
*  You've spent your life in politics. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1490.36s)]
*  What was different about what took place online? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1494.36s)]
*  The first point was it was much more personal. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1498.36s)]
*  You are looking so ugly. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1501.36s)]
*  You are an old woman. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1503.36s)]
*  We know where you live. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1505.36s)]
*  Or even you should be raped by a group of men so that you see what all these immigrants are doing. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1507.36s)]
*  So this was not elevated conversation. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1514.36s)]
*  This was very personal and very hateful. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1517.36s)]
*  It was very personal. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1519.36s)]
*  Kuhnast asked Metta to delete all the false quotes attributed to her worldwide. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1521.36s)]
*  And they were astonished. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1526.36s)]
*  What? We cannot do it. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1528.36s)]
*  They said just by software, the software is not able to deal with all this. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1529.36s)]
*  And we have to get a lot of new employees. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1534.36s)]
*  And I said, yes, it's my personal right. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1537.36s)]
*  It's my reputation. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1540.36s)]
*  Kuhnast sued Facebook and won. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1542.36s)]
*  Last year, in a landmark case, a German court ruled Metta had to remove all the fake quotes attributed to her. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1545.36s)]
*  Metta is appealing. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1552.36s)]
*  This court said in case of public servants which have public offices and jobs, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1554.36s)]
*  it's public interest that their personal rights are protected because otherwise no one would go for these jobs that would harm democracy. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1562.36s)]
*  After all this, are you seeing less hateful comments now on your social media feeds? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1572.36s)]
*  Yes, there are less hateful comments. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1578.36s)]
*  And there was one tweet which says, don't say that to her. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1581.36s)]
*  She will take you to court. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1586.36s)]
*  You might sue them. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1588.36s)]
*  Last year, the European Union implemented a new law that requires social media companies to stop the spread of harmful content online in Europe or face millions of dollars in fines. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1590.36s)]
*  But Josefine Ballon of Hate Aid says some social media companies are still not complying with the new law. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1603.36s)]
*  I would love social media companies to be a safer place than they are right now. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1611.36s)]
*  But what we see is that their content moderation is not comprehensive. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1617.36s)]
*  Sometimes it seems to be working well in some areas, but in many areas it's just not. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1622.36s)]
*  The European Commission is currently investigating whether Elon Musk's social media company, X, has breached the EU digital content law. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1629.36s)]
*  Musk, who has been criticized for using X to promote Germany's far-right party ahead of next week's elections, accused the EU of censorship and hating democracy. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1639.36s)]
*  But in Lower Saxony, prosecutors argue they are protecting democracy and discourse by introducing a touch of German order to the unruly worldwide web. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1650.36s)]
*  You're doing all this work. You're launching all these investigations. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1662.36s)]
*  You're finding people, sometimes putting them in jail. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1666.36s)]
*  Does it make a difference if it's a worldwide web and there's a lot of hate out there? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1671.36s)]
*  I would say yes, because what's the option? The option is to say we don't do anything? No. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1677.36s)]
*  We are prosecutors. If we see a crime, we want to investigate it. It's a lot of work. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1683.36s)]
*  And there are also borders. It's not an area without law. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1689.36s)]
*  What's the best way to get to the bottom of this? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1696.36s)]
*  The best way to get to the bottom of this? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1701.36s)]
*  Bob Dylan is not just a singing and songwriting legend. He's one of the most enigmatic and reclusive musicians of our time. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1705.36s)]
*  Playing him in a movie based on his life would be a daunting task for any actor. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1712.36s)]
*  But when Timothée Chalamet was offered the role, he was 23 and says he knew practically nothing about Dylan. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1717.36s)]
*  A lot of people told him not to do it, but Chalamet likes a creative challenge. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1723.36s)]
*  The film, called A Complete Unknown, came out in December and received eight Oscar nominations, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1728.36s)]
*  including Timothée Chalamet's second best actor nod. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1733.36s)]
*  He's never met Bob Dylan, but because of the pandemic, strikes in Hollywood and other film commitments, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1737.36s)]
*  Chalamet ended up having about five years to study the man and his music, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1742.36s)]
*  determined like Bob Dylan was at his age to make it great. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1747.36s)]
*  I give 170% in everything. I'm doing no but there. I'm giving it my all. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1752.36s)]
*  Something like the Dylan Project, these aren't watered down experiences. I'm going Daniel Day Lewis on all of them. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1758.36s)]
*  I'm not saying in process, but I'm saying level of commitment. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1765.36s)]
*  And I don't know, man, it sounds like I'm desperate saying that or something, but... [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1768.36s)]
*  No, it sounds like you're a professional and you want it to be the best it can possibly be. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1772.36s)]
*  Yeah, and increasingly I don't want to shy away from saying that. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1775.36s)]
*  Chalamet, who's 29 now, didn't just need to figure out how to sing like Dylan, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1783.36s)]
*  he also learned how to play harmonica and guitar in about 40 Bob Dylan songs, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1788.36s)]
*  far more than were originally called for in the script. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1793.36s)]
*  It's a heartbreak, it's gonna fall. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1797.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1803.36s)]
*  The movie, set in the early 1960s, follows Bob Dylan's rapid rise from obscurity to stardom, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1806.36s)]
*  something Timothy Chalamet could relate to. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1812.36s)]
*  I was young when I left home and I'd been out rambling around. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1815.36s)]
*  Dylan was 19 when he arrived in New York from Minnesota. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1821.36s)]
*  With his complete unknown, he quickly became an icon in the world of folk music. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1825.36s)]
*  How many roads must a man walk down before you call him a man? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1830.36s)]
*  Poetic and political, his songs spoke to the times, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1839.36s)]
*  in a young generation demanding change. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1843.36s)]
*  And the first one now will later be last for the times they are exchanging. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1846.36s)]
*  Dylan got his start in New York at a nightclub called Café Waa in Greenwich Village. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1856.36s)]
*  This was one of his jump points, this was really a place where you could just go play folk music in the 60s, early 60s, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1861.36s)]
*  and I went during the movie, during the production, and it ain't the same. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1867.36s)]
*  What were they playing? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1870.36s)]
*  They were playing the Aerosmith covers and the ACDC, also worthy art. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1871.36s)]
*  But different. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1878.36s)]
*  Very different. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1879.36s)]
*  When Chalamet started researching Dylan, he did what many millennials likely would. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1880.36s)]
*  He looked him up on YouTube. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1885.36s)]
*  He found this clip particularly insightful, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1889.36s)]
*  Dylan performing on stage with Joan Baez, with whom he'd had a romantic relationship. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1891.36s)]
*  What I love about the It Ain't Me performance is how playful it is and what a laugh he's having. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1902.36s)]
*  He was the one, at least in the footnotes of history, that wasn't particularly, let's say, faithful with Joan. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1908.36s)]
*  So I get it from his perspective that he's having such a laugh. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1915.36s)]
*  On YouTube now you can play things at .5 speed or .75 speed, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1918.36s)]
*  and that was when I really slowed down because it's fascinating the way Bob observes her [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1922.36s)]
*  and how he refuses eye contact in that video. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1929.36s)]
*  This is Chalamet's version, with Monica Barberow playing Joan Baez. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1933.36s)]
*  You weren't trying to imitate Bob Dylan. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1949.36s)]
*  No, totally. That was the tension for me in doing a biopic on somebody so beloved and so well known was, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1951.36s)]
*  all right, where does my heart and where does my soul fit into this? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1956.36s)]
*  Can it fit into this, particularly with someone who is so masked? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1959.36s)]
*  I put myself in another place, but I'm a stranger there. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1962.36s)]
*  To connect with what might be behind Dylan's mask, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1969.36s)]
*  Chalamet disconnected from his own life for the two and a half months of filming. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1972.36s)]
*  He wouldn't use his cell phone or have visitors on set. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1979.36s)]
*  I never approached a character so intensely as Bob because I had such respect for the material [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1982.36s)]
*  and I knew I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I remembered that I was lazy on a day where something went wrong. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1986.36s)]
*  Chalamet pre-recorded all the Dylan songs he'd sing in the movie. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1995.36s)]
*  They were supposed to be played back on set during filming. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=1999.36s)]
*  It always sounded too clean. The recording equipment is too clean now. The guitars are too good. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2002.36s)]
*  Bob Dylan was drinking two bottles of red wine a day, sometimes smoking 30 packs of cigarettes. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2007.36s)]
*  Did you drink two bottles of wine and smoke 30 packs of that and like it? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2011.36s)]
*  The smoking I did, the wine I held back on more. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2014.36s)]
*  So Chalamet decided he wanted to try and sing and play live instead. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2018.36s)]
*  This scene was the first time he did it. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2023.36s)]
*  Dylan's just arrived in New York and visits his terminally ill hero, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2025.36s)]
*  folk music legend Woody Guthrie, played by Scoot McNary. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2029.36s)]
*  Edward Norton is Pete Seeger. On his first take, director James Mangold knew Chalamet nailed it. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2033.36s)]
*  Hey, hey Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2040.36s)]
*  There's a moment in that scene, right at the last stanza, where he holds a note. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2044.36s)]
*  Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men that come. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2050.3599999999997s)]
*  That would never have happened if we'd used the playback track. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2061.3599999999997s)]
*  Was that in the song originally? Because I mean there was... [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2063.3599999999997s)]
*  No. No. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2066.3599999999997s)]
*  The dust intergun with the wind. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2070.36s)]
*  He just did it. What I see Timmy executing in the scene is the growth of confidence within the song. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2075.36s)]
*  So by the end of the song, not only is he finishing it looking right at Woody, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2083.36s)]
*  but he's also holding it, which is like what a grand diva would do in the spotlight. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2087.36s)]
*  You can't tell someone to do that. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2093.36s)]
*  I'm not even sure Timmy completely plans it intellectually. That is that kind of talent. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2096.36s)]
*  Did you know you were going to do that? Was that a planned thing? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2105.36s)]
*  No. And it would be disingenuous to my, you know, the way I like to act or my approach to stuff. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2108.36s)]
*  You don't have any clue why you did it? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2114.36s)]
*  No, I think it just happened, yeah, truly. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2115.36s)]
*  Come on, give it to me. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2118.36s)]
*  That may be true or it may not. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2123.36s)]
*  Like Dylan, Chalamet is reluctant to talk about how he does what he does. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2126.36s)]
*  If there's magic in acting, Timothee Chalamet doesn't want to give it all away. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2131.36s)]
*  What's the concern about revealing the magic? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2136.36s)]
*  It's nobody's business how I go about these things. It's within the law. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2139.36s)]
*  It's within the law. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2143.36s)]
*  Yeah, and otherwise it might not be as interesting as people think, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2145.36s)]
*  or it could be a lot more interesting than people think. It might be more interesting than what I'm doing. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2149.36s)]
*  She's our friend. I'm her friend. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2152.36s)]
*  What Chalamet's done in nearly two dozen films has been plenty interesting. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2154.36s)]
*  In the Dune series, he transformed himself from the privileged son of a duke into a menacing messiah. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2158.36s)]
*  I am Paul Mardiva Trades, Duke of Arrakis. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2164.36s)]
*  It's no use, Joe. Joe, we've got to have it out. I have loved you ever since I've known you, Joe. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2168.36s)]
*  He's played Laurie in Little Women and a love-struck teenager in Call Me By Your Name. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2173.36s)]
*  Ah, where'd you learn to do that? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2178.36s)]
*  He took a risk reinventing Willy Wonka. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2184.36s)]
*  And his shape shifted between an adult drug addict and a reluctant King Henry V. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2194.36s)]
*  So you basically grew up in the theater district? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2199.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2201.36s)]
*  As a child, Chalamet didn't dream of becoming an actor, though he was surrounded by them. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2202.36s)]
*  He lived in this rent-subsidized apartment complex in Manhattan full of artists. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2207.36s)]
*  Oh, Izzy. How you doing, man? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2212.36s)]
*  What are you doing here? What's going on, man? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2214.36s)]
*  Doing a little interview, baby. Good to see you. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2216.36s)]
*  Growing up in this building certainly seems to have made an impression. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2218.36s)]
*  This building truthfully made me scared of acting because it's a tough lifestyle and a lot of people aren't doing fantastically. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2221.36s)]
*  It's a hard way to go about it. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2231.36s)]
*  You would think growing up here, it would encourage you to be an actor, but actually... [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2232.36s)]
*  No, it actually terrified me of becoming an actor. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2235.36s)]
*  His mom, Nicole Flender, was a dancer and works with the Actors' Equity Association. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2237.36s)]
*  His sister, Pauline Chalamet, is an actress, and Timmy, as his friends and family call him, booked occasional acting jobs as a child, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2242.36s)]
*  though he told us he really wanted to be a professional soccer player. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2250.36s)]
*  This is him on Law and Order when he was 12. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2254.36s)]
*  Could you please not tell Mom and Dad about us playing Xbox? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2257.36s)]
*  But his father, Marc Chalamet, a French journalist, wasn't exactly pushing him to act. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2261.36s)]
*  My dad, I think he very, very, very correctly, rightfully was wary growing up. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2266.36s)]
*  It's no place for a child. It really isn't. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2271.36s)]
*  You know, cameras and people going, hey, do the thing where we recognize you as cute in your own head. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2274.36s)]
*  I think my dad was more just like, be normal. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2280.36s)]
*  These days, that's easier said than done. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2282.36s)]
*  Do you have 12 zone pens? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2285.36s)]
*  That was amazing. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2286.36s)]
*  I appreciate it, man. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2287.36s)]
*  When we went to get a slice of pizza, he told us a turning point in his life was getting into LaGuardia High School, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2288.36s)]
*  a famously competitive public school for the performing arts. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2294.36s)]
*  It's a school that champions the arts, so there I doubled down. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2297.36s)]
*  I was not a distracted kid as a teenager, like maybe to a fault. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2301.36s)]
*  You know, I wasn't like partying or I don't say that to come off straight-laced, like to a fault. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2304.36s)]
*  I was like very focused and driven. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2309.36s)]
*  He was cast as the lead in school musicals. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2313.36s)]
*  I'm the bravest individual I have ever met. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2316.36s)]
*  And developed routines for LaGuardia's talent show as a rapper named Lil Timmy Tim. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2323.36s)]
*  Timmy Tim, Timmy Tim, Tim. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2328.36s)]
*  This is humiliating, but I'll show you guys. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2331.36s)]
*  He took us to the practice room in his building's basement where he'd rehearse. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2333.36s)]
*  How old were you there? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2337.36s)]
*  Here I'm 15, but I look like I'm seven. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2338.36s)]
*  These are two good friends of mine, Sheree and Desiree. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2341.36s)]
*  They're the only people in the world that did this talent show actively. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2343.36s)]
*  I probably asked 35 people. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2347.36s)]
*  He did go to college, Columbia University for a year and then some classes at New York University. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2349.36s)]
*  But he dropped out, wanting to focus on acting full-time. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2355.36s)]
*  Listen man, I was struggling. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2359.36s)]
*  I was struggling. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2363.36s)]
*  I was struggling with identity and I was struggling with your sense of self-respect, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2364.36s)]
*  your sense of drive or where you want to be pales in comparison to where you are. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2369.36s)]
*  Call Me By Your Name changed everything. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2377.36s)]
*  He was 21 when it came out. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2380.36s)]
*  Around the same age, Bob Dylan was when his career started to take off. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2382.36s)]
*  Chalamet became the youngest person nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in nearly 80 years. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2386.36s)]
*  We thought he'd relate to something Bob Dylan said about the meaning of destiny to Ed Bradley [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2394.36s)]
*  in a rare interview on 60 Minutes more than 20 years ago. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2399.36s)]
*  It's a feeling you have that you know something about yourself nobody else does. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2403.36s)]
*  The picture you have in your mind of what you're about will come true. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2409.36s)]
*  That's kind of a thing you kind of have to keep to your own self because it's a fragile feeling [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2415.36s)]
*  and you put it out there and somebody will kill it. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2420.36s)]
*  So it's best to keep that all inside. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2422.36s)]
*  Man, wow. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2427.36s)]
*  You watch this interview a lot. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2429.36s)]
*  Yeah, probably a thousand times, yeah. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2430.36s)]
*  I always love what he said about self-destiny being fragile. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2432.36s)]
*  You believe that too, that if... [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2435.36s)]
*  I believe that especially early on in life and your career when you're in your early 20s or late teens. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2437.36s)]
*  And if you can find a way to keep it quiet but also have a lot of confidence, it's the best path, you know. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2442.36s)]
*  It's interesting to me that you still haven't met Bob Dylan. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2447.36s)]
*  No, no. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2449.36s)]
*  Is that weird to you? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2451.36s)]
*  I mean, it's not, you know. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2452.36s)]
*  He doesn't seem like he wants to be bothered by not me but by everyone the last 60, 70 years. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2454.36s)]
*  What would you say to him? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2459.36s)]
*  I would say thank you. I would just say thank you. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2460.36s)]
*  You know what? That's f***ed. I'm going to take that back. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2462.36s)]
*  I wouldn't, you know, honestly, I would honestly just be like, I would play it super cool, you know. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2464.36s)]
*  Because I feel like he's probably used to so much hyperbole and praise. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2470.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2474.36s)]
*  Maybe I would try to out... [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2475.36s)]
*  Out cool him? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2477.36s)]
*  Out Bob him. Not cool, out Bob him. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2478.36s)]
*  Yeah. Just like strangely not bring anything up around him. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2480.36s)]
*  Not even mention that you did. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2484.36s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe just talk about like... [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2486.36s)]
*  The weather. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2487.36s)]
*  The weather and, you know, what his favorite sandwich is or something like that. Yeah. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2488.36s)]
*  When I watch Timothy... [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2497.36s)]
*  Now, the last minute of 60 minutes. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2505.36s)]
*  Last September, we went inside the National Archives with Colleen Shogan, the Chief Archivist of the United States. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2507.36s)]
*  She was fired by President Trump on February 7th. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2515.36s)]
*  No cause was given for her dismissal. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2518.36s)]
*  The Archivist is responsible for protecting America's heritage, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2521.36s)]
*  and 13 and a half billion other documents, including eventually those of the current Commander in Chief. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2528.36s)]
*  All those records ultimately belong to the American people. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2535.36s)]
*  We asked Shogan last year what made the independent federal agencies work so important. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2539.36s)]
*  In a democracy, we rely upon transparency. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2545.36s)]
*  We rely upon accountability of the state, the state's administration, the state's administration. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2550.36s)]
*  We rely on accountability of our officials. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2557.36s)]
*  And records are one way that we hold our elected officials and hold our government accountable. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2560.36s)]
*  I'm Nora O'Donnell. We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1B_uxq8pg&t=2567.36s)]
