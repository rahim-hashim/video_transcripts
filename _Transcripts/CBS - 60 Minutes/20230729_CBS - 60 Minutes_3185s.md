# Encounters with UFOs; Search for ancient life on Mars; James Webb Space Telescope | Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY)
*  We have tackled many strange stories on 60 Minutes, but perhaps none like this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the story of the U.S. government's grudging acknowledgement of unidentified [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=18.8s)]
*  aerial phenomena, UAP, more commonly known as UFOs. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=23.32s)]
*  After decades of public denial, the Pentagon now admits there's something out there, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=29.5s)]
*  and the U.S. Senate wants to know what it is. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=35.14s)]
*  The Intelligence Committee has ordered the Director of National Intelligence and the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=38.26s)]
*  Secretary of Defense to deliver a report on the mysterious sightings by next month. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=42.18s)]
*  So what you're telling me is that UFOs, unidentified flying objects, are real? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=49.7s)]
*  Bill, I think we're beyond that already. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=58.86s)]
*  The government has already stated for the record that they're real. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=61.540000000000006s)]
*  I'm not telling you that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=63.900000000000006s)]
*  The United States government is telling you that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=64.9s)]
*  Luis Elizondo spent 20 years running military intelligence operations worldwide in Afghanistan, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=67.5s)]
*  the Middle East, and Guantanamo. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=74.22s)]
*  He hadn't given UFOs a second thought until 2008. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=76.74s)]
*  That's when he was asked to join something at the Pentagon called the Advanced Aerospace [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=81.06s)]
*  Threat Identification Program, or ATIP. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=85.58s)]
*  The mission of ATIP was quite simple. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=89.38s)]
*  It was to collect and analyze information involving anomalous aerial vehicles. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=90.94s)]
*  What I guess in the vernacular you call them UFOs. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=96.74s)]
*  We call them UAPs. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  You know how this sounds. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=101.24s)]
*  It sounds nutty, wacky. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=102.74s)]
*  Look, Bill, I'm not telling you that it doesn't sound wacky. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=105.06s)]
*  What I'm telling you is real. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=109.38s)]
*  The question is what is it, what are its intentions, what are its capabilities? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=110.9s)]
*  Buried away in the Pentagon, ATIP was part of a $22 million program sponsored by then [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=115.58s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to investigate UFOs. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=122.06s)]
*  When Elizondo took over in 2010, he focused on the national security implications of unidentified [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=126.92s)]
*  aerial phenomena documented by U.S. service members. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=133.48s)]
*  Imagine a technology that can do 600 to 700 G-forces, that can fly at 13,000 miles an [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=137.76s)]
*  hour, that can evade radar, and that can fly through air and water and possibly space, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=143.88s)]
*  and oh, by the way, has no obvious signs of propulsion, no wings, no control surfaces, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=152.28s)]
*  and yet still can defy the natural effects of Earth's gravity. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=157.2s)]
*  That's precisely what we're seeing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=160.56s)]
*  Elizondo tells us ATIP was a loose-knit mix of scientists, electro-optical engineers, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=162.16s)]
*  avionics and intelligence experts often working part-time. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=168.56s)]
*  They combed through data and records and analyzed videos like this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  Oh, go ahead. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=177.68s)]
*  A Navy aircrew struggles to lock on to a fast-moving object off the U.S. Atlantic coast in 2015. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=182.8s)]
*  Hold it right there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=189.32s)]
*  Look at it cry. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=190.32s)]
*  Recently released images may not convince UFO skeptics, but the Pentagon admits it doesn't [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  know what in the world this is. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=198.4s)]
*  Or this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=201.68s)]
*  Or this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=203.32s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=204.32s)]
*  So what do you say to the skeptics? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=205.32s)]
*  It's refracted light, weather balloons, a rocket being launched, Venus. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=207.6s)]
*  In some cases, there are simple explanations for what people are witnessing, but there [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=215.6s)]
*  are some that are not. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=220.56s)]
*  We're not just simply jumping to a conclusion that's saying, oh, that's a UAP out there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=223.88s)]
*  We're going through our due diligence. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=228.04s)]
*  Is it some sort of new type of cruise missile technology that China has developed? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=229.52s)]
*  Is it some sort of high-altitude balloon that's conducting reconnaissance? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=233.4s)]
*  Ultimately, when you have exhausted all those what-ifs and you're still left with the fact [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=237.8s)]
*  that this is in our airspace and it's real, that's when it becomes compelling and that's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=243.88s)]
*  when it becomes problematic. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=249.24s)]
*  Former Navy pilot Lieutenant Ryan Graves calls whatever is out there a security risk. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  He told us his F-18 squadron began seeing UAPs hovering over restricted airspace southeast [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=258.16s)]
*  of Virginia Beach in 2014 when they updated their jet's radar, making it possible to zero [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=265.16s)]
*  in with infrared targeting cameras. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=271.64000000000004s)]
*  So you're seeing it both with the radar and with the infrared, and that tells you that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=274.16s)]
*  there is something out there. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=279.68s)]
*  Pretty hard to spoof that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=282.44s)]
*  These photographs were taken in 2019 in the same area. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  The Pentagon confirms these are images of objects it can't identify. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=288.24s)]
*  Lieutenant Graves told us pilots training off the Atlantic coast see things like that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=293.44s)]
*  all the time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=298.56s)]
*  Every day. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=300.6s)]
*  Every day for at least a couple years. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=301.92s)]
*  Wait a minute, every day for a couple of years? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=306.6s)]
*  I don't see an exhaust pool. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=307.6s)]
*  Including this one, off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida in 2015 captured on a targeting camera [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=309.92s)]
*  by members of Graves' squadron. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  Look at this thing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  It's rotating. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  My gosh. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  They're all going against the wind. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  The wind's 120 knots to the west. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  Look at the whole thing, dude. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  You can sort of hear a surprise in their voices. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=330.56s)]
*  You certainly can. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=332.56s)]
*  They seem to have broke character a bit. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=333.56s)]
*  And we're just kind of amazed at what they were seeing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=335.56s)]
*  What do you think when you see something like this? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=338.56s)]
*  This is a difficult one to explain. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  You have rotation. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  You have high altitudes. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=344.36s)]
*  You have propulsion, right? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=345.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=346.84s)]
*  I don't know what it is, frankly. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=347.84s)]
*  He told us pilots speculate they are one of three things. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  Secret U.S. technology, an adversary spy vehicle, or something otherworldly? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=354.8s)]
*  I'd say, you know, the highest probability is it's a threat observation program. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=360.8s)]
*  Could it be Russian or Chinese technology? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=365.8s)]
*  I don't see why not. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=369.28s)]
*  Are you alarmed? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=370.28s)]
*  I am worried, frankly. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=371.88s)]
*  You know, if these were tactical jets from another country that were hanging out up there, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=374.08s)]
*  it would be a massive issue. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=376.88s)]
*  But because it looks slightly different, we're not willing to actually look at the problem [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=378.96s)]
*  in the face. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=382.28s)]
*  We're happy to just ignore the fact that these are out there watching us every day. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  The government has ignored it, at least publicly, since closing its Project Blue Book investigation [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=388.68s)]
*  in 1969. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=393.8s)]
*  But that began to change after an incident off Southern California in 2004, which was [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=395.6s)]
*  documented by radar, by camera, and four naval aviators. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=401.0s)]
*  We spoke to two of them, David Fravor, a graduate of the Top Gun Naval Flight School, and commander [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=406.12s)]
*  of the F-18 Squadron on the USS Nimitz, and flying at his wing, Lieutenant Alex Dietrich, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=412.36s)]
*  who has never spoken publicly about the encounter. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=418.96s)]
*  I never wanted to be on national TV, no offense. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=422.48s)]
*  So why are you doing this? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=426.36s)]
*  Because I was in a government aircraft, because I was on the clock, and so I feel a responsibility [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=428.2s)]
*  to share what I can, and it is unclassified. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=434.56s)]
*  It was November 2004, and the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group was training about 100 [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=439.64000000000004s)]
*  miles southwest of San Diego. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=446.0s)]
*  For a week, the advanced new radar on a nearby ship, the USS Princeton, had detected what [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=448.52000000000004s)]
*  operators called multiple anomalous aerial vehicles over the horizon, descending 80,000 [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  feet in less than a second. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=460.88s)]
*  On November 14, Fravor and Dietrich, each with a weapons system officer in the backseat, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=464.56s)]
*  were diverted to investigate. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=470.24s)]
*  They found an area of roiling white water the size of a 737 in an otherwise calm blue [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=473.0s)]
*  sea. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=479.72s)]
*  So as we're looking at this, her backseater says, hey, skipper, do you? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=481.12s)]
*  And about that got out, I said, dude, do you see that thing down there? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=487.72s)]
*  And we saw this little white tic-tac-looking object, and it's just kind of moving above [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=491.56s)]
*  the white water area. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=496.03999999999996s)]
*  As Dietrich circled above, Fravor went in for a closer look. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=497.56s)]
*  Sort of spiraling down? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=502.36s)]
*  Yep. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=503.36s)]
*  The tic-tac still pointing north-south, it goes, and just turns abruptly and starts mirroring [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=504.36s)]
*  me. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  So as I'm coming down, it starts coming up. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=510.59999999999997s)]
*  So it's mimicking your moves. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=512.24s)]
*  Yeah, it was where we were there. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=514.0s)]
*  He said it was about the size of his F-18, with no markings, no wings, no exhaust plumes. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=515.8s)]
*  I'll see how close I can get. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  So I go like this, and it's climbing still. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  And when it gets right in front of me, it just disappears. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=526.52s)]
*  Disappears? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=529.76s)]
*  Disappears. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=530.76s)]
*  Like gone. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=531.76s)]
*  It had sped off. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=532.76s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=534.12s)]
*  So your mind tries to make sense of it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=536.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to categorize this as maybe a helicopter or maybe a drone. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=538.16s)]
*  And when it disappeared, I mean, it was just... [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=543.72s)]
*  Did your backseaters see this too? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=546.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=548.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=549.32s)]
*  There was four of us in the airplanes literally watching this thing for roughly about five [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=550.32s)]
*  minutes. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=553.28s)]
*  Seconds later, the Princeton reacquired the target, 60 miles away. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=554.28s)]
*  Another crew managed to briefly lock onto it with a targeting camera before it zipped [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=559.84s)]
*  off again. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=564.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, I think that over beers we've sort of said, hey man, if I saw this solo, I don't [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=565.8000000000001s)]
*  know that I would have come back and said anything because it sounds so crazy when I [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=571.76s)]
*  say it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=575.12s)]
*  Do you understand that reaction? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=576.12s)]
*  I do. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=578.2s)]
*  I've had some people tell me, you know, when you say that, you can sound crazy. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=579.2s)]
*  I'll be honest, I'm not a UFO guy. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=582.08s)]
*  But from what I hear you guys saying, there's something. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=585.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=589.52s)]
*  Oh, there's definitely something that... [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=590.52s)]
*  I don't know who's building it, who's got the technology, who's got the brains, but [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=592.52s)]
*  there's something out there that was better than our airplane. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=597.52s)]
*  The air crew filed reports. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=601.76s)]
*  Then, like the mysterious flying object, the Nimitz encounter disappeared. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=603.76s)]
*  Nothing was said or done officially for five years until Lou Elizondo came across the story [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=609.68s)]
*  and investigated. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=616.56s)]
*  We spend millions of dollars in training these pilots and they are seeing something that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=618.4s)]
*  they can't explain. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=622.92s)]
*  Furthermore, that information is being backed up on electro-optical data, like gun camera [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=624.64s)]
*  footage, and if I rate our data, now to me, that's compelling. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=628.76s)]
*  Inside the Pentagon, his findings were met with skepticism. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=633.36s)]
*  ACHIP's funding was eliminated in 2012, but Elizondo says he and a handful of others kept [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=636.84s)]
*  the mission alive until finally, frustrated, he quit the Pentagon in 2017. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=643.1999999999999s)]
*  But not before getting these three videos declassified. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=649.64s)]
*  And then things took a stranger turn. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=654.16s)]
*  I tried to help my colleague Lou Elizondo elevate the issue in the department and actually [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=657.12s)]
*  get it to the Secretary of Defense. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=660.96s)]
*  Christopher Mellon served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence for [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=662.8s)]
*  Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush and had access to top secret government programs. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=667.4s)]
*  So it's not us. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=673.74s)]
*  That's one thing we know. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=674.8199999999999s)]
*  We know that. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=676.12s)]
*  I say that with a very high degree of confidence, in part because of the positions I held in [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=677.24s)]
*  the department and I know the process. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=681.12s)]
*  Mellon says he grew concerned nothing was being done about UAPs, so he decided to do [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=683.96s)]
*  something. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=690.52s)]
*  In 2017, as a private citizen, he surreptitiously acquired the three Navy videos Elizondo had [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=691.52s)]
*  declassified and leaked them to the New York Times. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=698.08s)]
*  It's bizarre and unfortunate that someone like myself has to do something like that [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=702.84s)]
*  to get a national security issue like this on the agenda. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=708.24s)]
*  He joined forces with now civilian Lou Elizondo and they started to tell their story to anybody [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=711.32s)]
*  who would listen, to newspapers, the History Channel, to members of Congress. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=717.4000000000001s)]
*  We knew and understood that you had to go to the public, get the public interested, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=722.8000000000001s)]
*  to get Congress interested, to then circle back to the Defense Department and get them [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=726.08s)]
*  to start taking a look at it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=730.8s)]
*  And now it is. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=732.4399999999999s)]
*  This past August, the Pentagon resurrected AATIP. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=734.4399999999999s)]
*  It's now called the UAP Task Force. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=737.92s)]
*  Service members now are encouraged to report strange encounters and the Senate wants answers. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=741.0799999999999s)]
*  Anything that enters an airspace that's not supposed to be there is a threat. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=748.0799999999999s)]
*  After receiving classified briefings on UAPs, Senator Marco Rubio called for a detailed [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=751.8399999999999s)]
*  analysis. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=757.68s)]
*  This past December, while he was still head of the Intelligence Committee, he asked the [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=759.3s)]
*  Director of National Intelligence and the Pentagon to present Congress an unclassified [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=763.76s)]
*  report by next month. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=769.2199999999999s)]
*  This is a bizarre issue. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=771.62s)]
*  The Pentagon and other branches of the military have a long history of sort of dismissing [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=773.18s)]
*  this. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=777.9799999999999s)]
*  What makes you think that this time is going to be different? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=779.78s)]
*  I mean, we're going to find out when we get that report. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=781.4599999999999s)]
*  You know, there's a stigma on Capitol Hill. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=783.8199999999999s)]
*  Some of my colleagues are very interested in this topic and some kind of giggle when [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=786.38s)]
*  you bring it up. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=791.14s)]
*  But I don't think we can allow the stigma to keep us from having an answer to a very [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=792.1999999999999s)]
*  fundamental question. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=796.1s)]
*  What do you want us to do about this? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=797.4599999999999s)]
*  I want us to take it seriously and have a process to take it seriously. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=799.12s)]
*  I want us to have a process to analyze the data every time it comes in, that there be [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=802.38s)]
*  a place where this is catalogued and constantly analyzed until we get some answers. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=806.38s)]
*  Maybe it has a very simple answer. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=811.3s)]
*  Maybe it doesn't. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=814.98s)]
*  We first told you about the tiny helicopter Ingenuity and the one-ton rover Perseverance [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=823.1800000000001s)]
*  nearly a year ago, before they left Earth. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=827.86s)]
*  But they've come a very long way since then. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=830.94s)]
*  In February, they landed in a hazardous and previously unexplored part of Mars called [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=833.9s)]
*  the Jezero Crater, where Perseverance will be looking for signs of ancient life. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=838.22s)]
*  Last month, Ingenuity disconnected from Perseverance's belly and made history, performing the first [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=843.88s)]
*  flights ever in the atmosphere of another planet. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=849.36s)]
*  It's hard to imagine, but worth remembering as you watch what we're about to show you [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=852.24s)]
*  that this all happened millions of miles away in outer space. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=857.04s)]
*  Last month, in this desolate Martian crater 170 million miles from Earth, Perseverance [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=862.96s)]
*  posed for a selfie with Ingenuity, the little helicopter it had just dropped off. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=868.76s)]
*  Two weeks later, the rover's cameras recorded Ingenuity's historic first flight, hovering [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=874.74s)]
*  ten feet off the ground for 30 seconds. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=879.92s)]
*  It may not look like much, but for those who'd worked so long to make it happen, it was a [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=882.6s)]
*  reason to rejoice. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=887.8s)]
*  Project manager Mimi Ong led the team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California that's [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=890.4s)]
*  been working on Ingenuity for six years. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=895.32s)]
*  How hard is it to fly a helicopter on Mars? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=899.0s)]
*  Very, very, very hard. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=901.4000000000001s)]
*  We really truly started with the question of, is it possible? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=904.6400000000001s)]
*  A lot of people thought it could not be done. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=908.32s)]
*  Because it's really counterintuitive. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=910.88s)]
*  I mean, you need atmosphere for the place to push, atmosphere to get lived. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=911.88s)]
*  The atmosphere on Mars is completely different than the world. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=916.2s)]
*  The atmosphere on Mars is so thin. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=918.2s)]
*  I mean, the room we're in, right, it's compared to that, it's 1% of the atmospheric density [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=920.24s)]
*  over there. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=924.5600000000001s)]
*  So the question of, really, can you generate enough lift, you know, to really build, to [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=925.5600000000001s)]
*  lift up anything, that was the fundamental question. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=930.32s)]
*  In subsequent flights, Ingenuity has gone longer and farther, traveling for about two [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=933.6400000000001s)]
*  minutes and nearly the length of three football fields. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=938.1600000000001s)]
*  It is a triumph not only for NASA, but for its partners in the private sector, who helped [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=941.6800000000001s)]
*  make various parts of the helicopter. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=946.6s)]
*  Don't let it go. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=949.4000000000001s)]
*  Don't freak out. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=950.4000000000001s)]
*  Keenan has a history of making unusual things that can fly. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=952.36s)]
*  He's an engineer at a company called AeroVironman, which produces drones for military and civilian [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=954.84s)]
*  use. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=960.72s)]
*  I mean, that's incredible. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=961.72s)]
*  Ten years ago, for a military research project, Keenan and his team created this robotic hummingbird, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=962.72s)]
*  which has a tiny camera on board. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=969.0799999999999s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=972.04s)]
*  There it is. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=973.04s)]
*  Oh my God, that's amazing. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=974.04s)]
*  Keenan and engineer Ben Pippenberg led the AeroVironman team that created Ingenuity's [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=979.68s)]
*  rotors, motors and landing gear. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=985.8s)]
*  Why was this so challenging? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=988.5s)]
*  Because it has to be a spacecraft as well as an aircraft. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=991.24s)]
*  And flying it as an aircraft on Mars is pretty challenging because of the density of the [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=996.0799999999999s)]
*  air that's similar to about Earth at 100,000 feet. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1001.1999999999999s)]
*  How do you go about it? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1003.8s)]
*  Well, so building everything extremely lightweight is really, really critical. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  The helicopter's blades, for example, are made of a styrofoam-like material coated with [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1010.72s)]
*  carbon fiber. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1015.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1016.08s)]
*  They're stiff and strong. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1017.08s)]
*  Get a sense of how lightweight and stiff that is. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1019.52s)]
*  It's nothing. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1022.44s)]
*  Yeah, it weighs nothing. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1023.44s)]
*  But incredibly light. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1024.48s)]
*  Here we go, taking off. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1026.48s)]
*  This is the first time they've shown an outsider this version of Ingenuity, which they plan [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1028.2s)]
*  to use for education and research. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1032.76s)]
*  They call it Terry. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1035.2199999999998s)]
*  A lift off. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1036.4199999999998s)]
*  Here on Earth, Terry's blades are spinning at about 400 revolutions per minute. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1038.4199999999998s)]
*  On Mars, in the thin atmosphere, they'd have to spin six times faster to generate the same [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1043.3799999999999s)]
*  lift. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1048.6999999999998s)]
*  And then land. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1049.6999999999998s)]
*  Ingenuity costs $85 million to build and operate, Terry a lot less, but it's still nerve-racking [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1051.6999999999998s)]
*  to be handed its controls. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1057.78s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1059.5s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1060.5s)]
*  You've got it. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1061.5s)]
*  Slide it right. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1062.5s)]
*  Slide it all the way to the right if you want. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1063.5s)]
*  Slide left. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1066.1s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1067.1s)]
*  I'll bring it up a little bit. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1068.1s)]
*  Now stop. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1069.26s)]
*  The joysticks we use to fly Terry are of no use on Mars. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1070.34s)]
*  Radio signals take too long to get there. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1074.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1076.7s)]
*  Let me take over now. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1077.7s)]
*  I've switched you out. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1078.7s)]
*  And we'll go back to the... [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1079.7s)]
*  Even someone as good at flying drones and hummingbirds as Matt Keenan couldn't fly a [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1083.18s)]
*  helicopter on Mars. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1087.5s)]
*  Engineers would happen in 2014 in a test chamber that replicated the atmosphere on Mars when [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1089.46s)]
*  Keenan tried to use a joystick to fly an early version of Ingenuity. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1094.74s)]
*  Surprise. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1099.06s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1100.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1101.06s)]
*  So much for that vehicle. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1102.22s)]
*  So this very quick demonstration is a show you a human being can't respond quickly enough [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1103.22s)]
*  to control it. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1108.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1109.14s)]
*  So engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory equipped Ingenuity with a computerized system [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1110.14s)]
*  that allows it to stabilize itself and navigate on its own. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1116.02s)]
*  In 2016, the new system aced the chamber test. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1119.02s)]
*  The blades are being commanded, you know, four or five hundred times per second. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1123.58s)]
*  They proved it could fly, but Ingenuity still had to weigh under four pounds and fit in [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1128.1s)]
*  the belly of perseverance. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1133.02s)]
*  Five. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1134.58s)]
*  Five. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1135.58s)]
*  Four. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1136.58s)]
*  Engine ignition. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1137.58s)]
*  Two. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1138.58s)]
*  One. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1139.58s)]
*  And it had to be tough enough to survive the journey to Mars. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1140.58s)]
*  And liftoff. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1142.76s)]
*  On July 30th, 2020, Perseverance and Ingenuity took off from Cape Canaveral. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1144.72s)]
*  Nearly seven months later, as this simulation shows, the spacecraft's heat shield hit the [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1151.0s)]
*  Martian atmosphere, going 12,000 miles per hour. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1155.48s)]
*  Perseverance ready to execute entry, descent and landing on her own. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1160.08s)]
*  As he sat in the control room, Al Chen, the leader of the landing team, had absolutely [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1164.44s)]
*  no control. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1169.1000000000001s)]
*  Radio signals would take about 11 minutes to travel from Earth to Mars. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1170.6s)]
*  The spacecraft was pre-programmed to descend, maneuver and pick a landing site on its own. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1175.04s)]
*  All the work his colleagues hoped to do on Mars would be impossible if his part of the [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1181.04s)]
*  mission failed. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1185.52s)]
*  How long have you been working on this mission? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1187.04s)]
*  Coming up on nine years or so. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1189.32s)]
*  Really? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1190.6s)]
*  That's a lot of work for seven minutes of terror. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1191.6s)]
*  Nine years of work, seven minutes of terror. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1194.1999999999998s)]
*  It's done if the parachute doesn't work. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1196.1999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1197.52s)]
*  No one wants to be the guy that drops the baton. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1198.52s)]
*  No landing by a spacecraft has ever been recorded as well as this one. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1201.72s)]
*  There were six cameras capturing it all from different angles. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1206.2s)]
*  The parachute deployed, then the heat shield fell away like a lens cap, and Perseverance [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1209.72s)]
*  got its first look at the ground. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1215.0s)]
*  This is not a simulation. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1218.24s)]
*  This is what it looks like to parachute onto Mars. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1220.16s)]
*  How fast is it moving at this point? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1225.04s)]
*  Yeah, we're still going about 350 miles an hour and still slowing down. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1226.48s)]
*  So it looks gentle here, but in fact, it's falling at more than 300 miles an hour. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1229.0800000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1234.3200000000002s)]
*  We're heading straight down at near race car speeds. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1235.3200000000002s)]
*  Below lay a series of safe landing spots, but the wind was blowing the spacecraft towards [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1237.92s)]
*  more treacherous territory to the east, and Perseverance sent a message to Earth saying [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1242.64s)]
*  the thrusters it needed to slow down might not be working properly. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1247.52s)]
*  So you get a reading saying the jets that are going to help it slow down and control [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1252.16s)]
*  the landing, that they're not working. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1257.2s)]
*  So what do you do? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1258.8400000000001s)]
*  There's nothing you can do, right? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1259.8400000000001s)]
*  Everything's already happened. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1261.6000000000001s)]
*  That's the mind bending part of this, right? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1262.6000000000001s)]
*  You are sweating now. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1264.48s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1265.48s)]
*  I'm right back there again. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1266.48s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1267.48s)]
*  To Al Chen's relief, Perseverance's computerized landing system did what it was designed to [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1268.48s)]
*  do. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1276.6000000000001s)]
*  It found a suitable landing spot even in rocky terrain. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1277.6000000000001s)]
*  And despite the warning, the thrusters worked. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1281.2s)]
*  You can see them kicking up dust as they fire to slow the spacecraft down. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1284.28s)]
*  The descent stage, known as the sky crane, lowered Perseverance to the ground. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1289.96s)]
*  It hovered for a moment and flew off to crash a safe distance away. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1294.8400000000001s)]
*  And there goes the descent stage. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1299.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1300.0s)]
*  Touchdown confirmed. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1301.0s)]
*  Perseverance, take flight on the surface of Mars. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1302.0s)]
*  So at that point, big sigh of relief. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1305.0s)]
*  You know, I almost collapsed over this console. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1307.8400000000001s)]
*  Ever since Perseverance landed on the red planet, a team of engineers, programmers and [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1310.52s)]
*  scientists here on Earth have been living on Mars time. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1315.04s)]
*  It's their job to monitor the rover's health and tell it where to go and how to search [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1318.6399999999999s)]
*  for signs of life. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1323.36s)]
*  While Perseverance sleeps to conserve energy during the freezing Martian nights, the team [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1324.8s)]
*  on Earth analyzes the photographs and instrument readings it sent back. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1329.32s)]
*  They then prepare a list of things for it to do the following morning when it wakes [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1334.48s)]
*  up. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1338.44s)]
*  Just after midnight on Mars, the vehicle's asleep. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1339.44s)]
*  Project manager Matt Wallace explained that a day on Mars is 40 minutes longer than on [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1342.72s)]
*  Earth. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1347.1200000000001s)]
*  The team's schedule is constantly changing. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1348.1200000000001s)]
*  So all the people here are Mars night shift workers. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1351.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good way to think of it. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1355.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1357.1200000000001s)]
*  But I mean, working night shift is tough enough, but this is a night shift that's constantly [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1358.1200000000001s)]
*  shifting. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1361.16s)]
*  Constantly moving. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1362.16s)]
*  That's right. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1363.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1364.16s)]
*  On Perseverance's fourth day on Mars, it swiveled the powerful camera on its mast and took [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1365.24s)]
*  a look around. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1370.5600000000002s)]
*  A space enthusiast named Sean Doran put the images together, set them to music and posted [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1372.6000000000001s)]
*  the movie on YouTube. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1378.68s)]
*  Even one of the top scientists on the project was moved when he saw it. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1381.64s)]
*  You know, I went and got a beer and watched this thing scroll by. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1385.52s)]
*  And that moment, that was the moment when I felt like I was there. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1389.1200000000001s)]
*  Sean Farley leads the science team that will direct Perseverance through the Jezero crater. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1393.4s)]
*  It's an area that scientists have long wanted to search for signs of ancient life that may [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1397.8400000000001s)]
*  be hidden in the rocks. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1403.16s)]
*  The oldest evidence of life on Earth is about three and a half billion years old. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1405.18s)]
*  Those rocks were deposited in a shallow sea. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1409.92s)]
*  This crater that you see here was a lake three and a half billion years ago. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1413.5400000000002s)]
*  So we are looking at the same environment and the same time period on two different [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1418.18s)]
*  planets. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1422.16s)]
*  If it's determined, however long in the future, that no, there was not ever life, what does that mean? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1423.92s)]
*  The place where Perseverance landed here in Jezero crater is the most habitable time period [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1430.3600000000001s)]
*  on Mars and the most habitable environment that we know about. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1436.6000000000001s)]
*  This is as good as it gets, at least with our current understanding of what Mars has [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1440.0s)]
*  to offer. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1444.0800000000002s)]
*  And if we don't find life here, it does make us worry that perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1445.0800000000002s)]
*  Perseverance hasn't strayed far from its landing site yet, but its telescopic camera has already [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1452.04s)]
*  spotted a large number of boulders that Ken Farley says he didn't expect to see in the [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1456.94s)]
*  middle of an ancient lake. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1461.76s)]
*  So this has surprised you? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1463.8799999999999s)]
*  Absolutely, yeah. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1465.96s)]
*  So what did those boulders tell you? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1466.96s)]
*  The most reasonable interpretation is a flood. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1468.76s)]
*  You don't have fast-flowing water out in the middle of the lake. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1471.68s)]
*  You get fast-flowing water in a river. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1474.44s)]
*  And so what that's telling us is there was a river that was capable of transporting boulders [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1477.34s)]
*  that were this big. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1482.98s)]
*  So what, the lake would have gone down perhaps and then later on there was a flood? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1483.98s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1488.4599999999998s)]
*  Perseverance was supposed to leave Ingenuity behind after a 30-day demonstration of its [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1490.5s)]
*  flying ability. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1494.52s)]
*  The NASA officials recently said they'll keep the duo together for another month to explore [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1495.8999999999999s)]
*  how rovers and helicopters might work together in the future. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1501.1s)]
*  The fastest that Perseverance was designed to travel is a tenth of a mile per hour. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1506.1s)]
*  Ingenuity has already gone 80 times faster, according to project manager Mimi Ong. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1511.02s)]
*  Adding an aerial vehicle, a flying vehicle, for space exploration will be game-changing. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1516.5s)]
*  It frees you in a way. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1522.06s)]
*  Absolutely, yes. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1523.6599999999999s)]
*  So a flying vehicle, a rotorcraft, would allow us to get to places we simply can't access [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1524.78s)]
*  today, like sites of steep cliffs, inside deep crevices. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1528.8999999999999s)]
*  After Perseverance explores the floor of Jezero Crater, it'll head towards what's believed [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1533.04s)]
*  to be the remnant of an ancient river delta, where billions of years ago conditions should [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1537.68s)]
*  have been right for microorganisms to exist. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1542.68s)]
*  As this simulation shows, the rover's robotic arm can collect about 40 core samples of rock [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1546.12s)]
*  that'll be sealed in special tubes and left on the planet's surface. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1552.08s)]
*  NASA plans to send another mission to Mars to retrieve the tubes and bring them back [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1556.3999999999999s)]
*  to Earth. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1560.84s)]
*  In about 10 years, Ken Farley says, scientists examining those samples may be confronted [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1562.0s)]
*  with a new and perplexing question. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1567.6s)]
*  How do you look for life that may not be life as you know it? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1570.48s)]
*  We've never had to do that before. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1575.76s)]
*  We've never had to actually ask the question. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1577.08s)]
*  Is there a form of life that we can't even conceive of? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1580.24s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to have to conceive of it, I think. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1582.8799999999999s)]
*  That's the whole point of this. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1585.8s)]
*  We're going to have to start conceiving of life as we don't know it. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1586.8s)]
*  If all goes according to plan, Perseverance will be making tracks on Mars for years to [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1589.44s)]
*  come. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1593.96s)]
*  Since it's carrying the first working audio microphones on the Red Planet, we'll leave [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1594.96s)]
*  you with what it sounds like as the one-ton rover slowly moves across the vast, lonely [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1599.44s)]
*  expanses of Mars. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1605.48s)]
*  This December 22nd may become known as the day the universe changed. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1620.4s)]
*  That Wednesday, NASA expects to launch the James Webb Space Telescope, the largest and [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1627.16s)]
*  most expensive instrument ever flown. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1634.0800000000002s)]
*  One hundred times more powerful than the 31-year-old Hubble Telescope, Webb can see back in time [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1637.4s)]
*  all the way to the let-there-be-light moment. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1644.16s)]
*  That instant when a cold, dark universe ignited into stars. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1648.26s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1654.94s)]
*  Well, somehow that's a lot bigger than I imagined. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1658.26s)]
*  She's a big one. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1661.54s)]
*  A year ago, we were among the last humans to see the telescope, much as it will appear [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1663.06s)]
*  in space. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1668.14s)]
*  After our visit, it was packed away for a journey of a million miles, far beyond the [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1669.9s)]
*  moon, to lie forever in the grasp of the sun. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1675.66s)]
*  The operating life is how long? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1680.0800000000002s)]
*  It's designed for five and a half years with a goal of ten years. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1683.42s)]
*  So that means we carry enough stuff on there to last for ten years. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1687.18s)]
*  Amy Lowe is a systems engineer who took us up in the clean room at Northrop Grumman in [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1693.5400000000002s)]
*  Redondo Beach, California. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1699.5400000000002s)]
*  We had to invent it, design it, build it, and hand put it together. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1701.62s)]
*  At the bottom of the spacecraft, that silver shroud is a parasol, big as a tennis court, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1706.86s)]
*  to shield Webb from the sun. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1713.4199999999998s)]
*  Above, there are 21 feet of gold-plated mirrors, six times bigger than Hubble's mirror, to [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1715.62s)]
*  catch the earliest starlight in creation. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1722.6999999999998s)]
*  There are 18 of these hexagonal mirrors, but when you fold them out, they all work in concert [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1726.38s)]
*  as one mirror. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1734.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1735.5s)]
*  All 18 images will form one very nice, solid image. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1736.5s)]
*  That image would be invisible to the human eye. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1741.8200000000002s)]
*  Like a night vision camera, Webb is designed to see heat, infrared light, because that's [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1745.46s)]
*  the only signature left from the stars at the edge of time. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1752.14s)]
*  Even that glow will be so dim, the mirrors will have to squint for hours to expose an image. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1756.9s)]
*  How much confidence do you have? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1764.5400000000002s)]
*  You know, my job is to worry. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1767.26s)]
*  I personally feel confident that we have thought of everything. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1771.22s)]
*  Building of everything took more than 25 years and $10 billion. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1778.38s)]
*  Engineer Amy Lowe explained the challenge. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1784.74s)]
*  In my mind, the biggest engineering challenge was to build a sunshield capable of shielding [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1787.5400000000002s)]
*  the optics, the mirrors, and the instrument on Webb. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1794.7s)]
*  How do you build something big but lightweight? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1798.7s)]
*  The sunshield keeps Webb cold and dark. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1801.9s)]
*  Any infrared heat from the sun or earth would blind the telescope. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1805.02s)]
*  The five layers are made of gossamer sheets not unlike Mylar birthday balloons. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1810.06s)]
*  The layer facing the sun is layer one, and layer one reaches about 230 degrees Fahrenheit, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1816.26s)]
*  so a pretty warm oven, like if you wanted to cook a meringue or something. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1822.3s)]
*  And on the telescope side? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1826.06s)]
*  On the telescope side, it gets to negative 370 degrees Fahrenheit. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1828.62s)]
*  There is a roughly 600 degree difference between one side of the heat shield and the other. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1834.14s)]
*  Yes, it's amazing that it's able to do this with nothing more than these layers. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1840.0600000000002s)]
*  The engineering is amazing, but the science may reveal the universe. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1847.3400000000001s)]
*  Since the beginning, the Big Bang, the arrow of time has flown nearly 14 billion years. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1853.7s)]
*  Webb may see all the way back to the first 100 million, the baby universe. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1860.86s)]
*  Amber Strawn is an astrophysicist on the project. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1867.58s)]
*  Telescopes really are time machines. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1872.3s)]
*  They literally allow us to see into the past. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1874.6999999999998s)]
*  And the reason for that is just due to the nature of how light travels. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1878.6599999999999s)]
*  Light from the sun takes about eight minutes to get to the earth. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1882.6399999999999s)]
*  So we're seeing the sun as it was eight minutes ago. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1885.4199999999998s)]
*  And you can sort of think about stepping that further out into the universe. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1888.46s)]
*  So when we walk out under the stars and look above us, we're not seeing the stars as they [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1892.26s)]
*  are today. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1898.22s)]
*  We're seeing them as they were perhaps millions of years ago. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1899.6200000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1903.18s)]
*  Because it took that long for the light to reach the earth. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1904.18s)]
*  Yes, for sure. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1907.38s)]
*  How much do we know about the universe? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1908.8600000000001s)]
*  Everything we know about, everything we can see, me and you, everything on the planet, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1912.6200000000001s)]
*  the world, the hundreds of billions of other galaxies, all of that only makes up about [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1917.3400000000001s)]
*  five percent of the universe. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1921.5800000000002s)]
*  The rest of it, that other 95 percent, we have no idea what it is. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1924.0800000000002s)]
*  That 95 percent, the unknown, is all around us like a ghost. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1928.7s)]
*  Nearly all the cosmos is made up of what physicists call, in desperation, dark matter and dark [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1934.68s)]
*  energy. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1941.3600000000001s)]
*  Unforeseen, scientists infer they must exist because they're the best explanation for [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1942.84s)]
*  how galaxies form and move. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1949.1999999999998s)]
*  So we know that dark matter is sort of the scaffolding of the universe. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1952.36s)]
*  It's the structure on which galaxies sit. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1957.1399999999999s)]
*  And if there wasn't dark matter, there wouldn't be galaxies and there wouldn't be us. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1961.0s)]
*  What might the Webb Telescope reveal about dark matter? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1965.28s)]
*  It's like we have this 14 billion year old story of the universe, but we're missing that [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1969.56s)]
*  first chapter. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1973.86s)]
*  And Webb was specifically designed to allow us to see those very first galaxies that formed [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1975.32s)]
*  after the Big Bang. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1981.58s)]
*  Now galaxies are born and then they evolve, they change over time. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1983.12s)]
*  And this way that galaxies change must rely critically on dark matter. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1987.74s)]
*  And Webb is going to allow us to observe that process of galaxy evolution in much more detail. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1993.88s)]
*  The promise of discovery shielded Webb on what's already been a treacherous journey. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=1999.98s)]
*  It was to launch seven years ago, but delays come with a machine this ambitious. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2006.14s)]
*  Because of cost overruns, Webb was cancelled in 2011 by the House Appropriations Committee, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2012.4s)]
*  but it was saved in the Senate. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2018.7600000000002s)]
*  Its namesake is James Webb, head of NASA in the 1960s, who made science a top priority. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2021.22s)]
*  What are the stakes? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2028.78s)]
*  What's riding on that rocket with Webb? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2030.08s)]
*  When you talk about what's at stake, it really is NASA's reputation to take on a mission [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2032.5s)]
*  that is as challenging as Webb and be successful. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2037.88s)]
*  Bill Oakes and Greg Robinson run the program. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2041.3s)]
*  Oakes was an engineer on Hubble. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2044.2s)]
*  Robinson has supervised NASA quality and performance. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2046.46s)]
*  If you want to be bold and get the kind of science we're after, you have to make the [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2050.66s)]
*  investment. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2054.74s)]
*  And it's going to answer two big questions for astrophysics. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2056.2999999999997s)]
*  Where do we come from and are we alone? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2059.74s)]
*  We're looking forward to getting those results. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2062.02s)]
*  Is Webb going to work? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2064.08s)]
*  Yes, it's going to work. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2065.08s)]
*  I have very high confidence. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2066.58s)]
*  I am 100% confident. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2068.06s)]
*  Why 100% confident? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2069.66s)]
*  Because when I look at the testing that we have done over the years and the type of engineering [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2071.62s)]
*  that went into it, you build a sense of confidence that you know it. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2077.3799999999997s)]
*  You know it's going to work. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2080.64s)]
*  What are you most concerned about? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2082.12s)]
*  Unfolding the entire telescope is what you worry about. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2084.64s)]
*  The observatory had to be folded into an Ariane 5 rocket just 16 feet wide. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2087.3599999999997s)]
*  It's wrapped today tight as a rosebud. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2094.74s)]
*  In flight, more than 40 systems must blossom with perfection, including Amy Lowe's never [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2097.56s)]
*  invented before sunshield. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2104.22s)]
*  All five layers will be folded up and held in place by pins. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2107.16s)]
*  How many pins are there? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2112.8399999999997s)]
*  There's 107 of these membrane release devices and pins that hold all five layers pinned [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2114.3199999999997s)]
*  to this structure here called the UPS. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2121.2799999999997s)]
*  All total 107. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2124.2799999999997s)]
*  And as you're unfolding, how many of those can fail? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2125.92s)]
*  None. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2130.12s)]
*  None? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2131.12s)]
*  None. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2132.12s)]
*  Not one? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2133.12s)]
*  Not one. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2134.12s)]
*  There is literally no room for error. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2135.12s)]
*  We test and we do a lot of analysis to ensure that each and every single one of these will [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2136.72s)]
*  release on orbit. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2144.64s)]
*  $10 billion rides on those pins. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2146.12s)]
*  The Hubble telescope 340 miles up could be reached with a wrench. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2149.8399999999997s)]
*  Webb at a million miles is beyond repair. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2154.9199999999996s)]
*  Bill Oakes told us that if something does get stuck, there is an emergency plan. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2159.56s)]
*  We develop algorithms to essentially, we call it the shimmy, we do a little shake on [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2165.08s)]
*  a telescope and we can rock it back and forth. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2169.64s)]
*  That doesn't work. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2172.44s)]
*  We have another one we call the twirl, which can actually spin the telescope either clockwise [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2173.44s)]
*  or counterclockwise to help shake things loose. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2177.4s)]
*  So you're going to do what I do with devices when they're not working, you're going to [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2180.52s)]
*  shake it? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2183.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, can I do the same thing? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2184.64s)]
*  With 107 pins released, the mirrors synchronized and 10,000 things go right, Webb will be [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2187.88s)]
*  limited only by about 10 years of fuel for pivoting and pointing. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2195.32s)]
*  Canada contributed the aiming system that will guide Webb to wonders far and near. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2200.7200000000003s)]
*  More than a thousand astronomers around the world are competing for telescope time. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2207.6400000000003s)]
*  Heidi Hamill was granted 100 hours. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2212.52s)]
*  I have so many questions. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2215.92s)]
*  My particular focus is objects in our solar system. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2219.44s)]
*  Hamill told us that light is full of information. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2224.4s)]
*  Webb can define the chemistry of a place by analyzing its wavelengths of light. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2228.36s)]
*  What is the atmospheric water content of Mars and how does it change with time? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2234.76s)]
*  What drives the chemistry in the upper atmosphere of Neptune? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2240.32s)]
*  Can we see if there's water coming out of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2245.94s)]
*  There are just an infinite number of questions I want to answer. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2252.44s)]
*  Astrophysicist Natalie Batalia also has time on Webb. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2257.1600000000003s)]
*  She'll be looking at planets beyond our solar system. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2260.84s)]
*  On average, every star in the galaxy has at least one planet. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2264.84s)]
*  That means that there are more planets in the galaxy than there are stars. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2270.28s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of planets. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2274.32s)]
*  And with that many planets, Batalia is sure Webb could find some with the chemistry and [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2276.28s)]
*  conditions of life. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2282.4s)]
*  There happens to be one planetary system. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2285.0s)]
*  The star has seven planets orbiting it. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2288.6400000000003s)]
*  And the star is only about 40 light years away. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2291.52s)]
*  So it's a great target to study and it has three Earth-sized planets orbiting in what [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2294.58s)]
*  I would call the Goldilocks Zone where life could potentially exist. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2301.1s)]
*  Not too hot, not too cold. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2305.8199999999997s)]
*  That's the idea, yes. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2307.54s)]
*  And so this is also one of the very first targets that we're going to observe with Webb. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2309.22s)]
*  And what we'll be able to see is, is there carbon dioxide in the atmosphere? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2314.62s)]
*  What are the greenhouse gases? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2320.1s)]
*  Is there carbon dioxide in combination with methane? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2321.86s)]
*  Because that's what Earth has. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2325.2000000000003s)]
*  So by looking at these chemical constituents, we might be able to piece together if it's [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2326.76s)]
*  not just a planet in what we call the habitable zone, but if it's truly a habitable environment. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2331.38s)]
*  And somebody might ask, why does it matter? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2337.58s)]
*  The end point is to put an end to our cosmic loneliness. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2340.6200000000003s)]
*  We want to know if there's life out there. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2345.1800000000003s)]
*  From a researcher's perspective, is Webb evolutionary or revolutionary? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2347.82s)]
*  Every time you put a new piece of technology into space or you look at the universe with [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2355.7000000000003s)]
*  different eyes, you learn something revolutionary, something that you couldn't have even predicted. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2361.38s)]
*  I don't know what those surprises are going to be, but the technology is revolutionary [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2368.34s)]
*  and there will be tremendous surprises that will astound us. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2372.6600000000003s)]
*  Webb is on the doorstep aboard a European space agency rocket. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2377.62s)]
*  Some, including Amy Lowe, may hold their breath as it unfolds itself on the month-long journey [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2382.2999999999997s)]
*  to its station around the sun. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2388.7s)]
*  The first images, in six months or so, will be converted from invisible infrared into [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2391.6s)]
*  pictures suitable for headlines. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2398.02s)]
*  Chances are what we see, we will not understand. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2400.98s)]
*  The very definition of wonder. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2405.1s)]

*  More mysterious, more beautiful than humanity's dreams. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2424.9s)]
*  The largest telescope ever flown launched into deep space on Christmas Day 2021. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2429.3s)]
*  Its primary mission is to reveal the let there be light moment when the stars and galaxies [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2436.1800000000003s)]

*  of everything. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2453.1800000000003s)]
*  This is one of Webb's early deep dives into the cosmos. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2456.24s)]
*  Two hundred and fifty hours of exposures that expand the imagination. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2461.56s)]
*  And all these little dots are stars? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2468.24s)]
*  All these little dots are galaxies, some of which are bigger than our own. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2469.9599999999996s)]
*  Astrophysicist Brent Robertson flew us through 130,000 galaxies, half never seen before. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2475.08s)]
*  Enormous swirls of billions of stars each, some like our own Milky Way and others, well, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2483.32s)]
*  out of this world. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2491.76s)]
*  We call this galaxy at the center of the screen the Cosmic Rose. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2493.52s)]
*  Just by chance, it looks like a rose does. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2497.6400000000003s)]
*  You can see that dusty red, irregular galaxy. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2501.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, space is more crowded than you might think and actually galaxies wind up interacting [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2504.36s)]
*  with each other. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2509.0800000000004s)]

*  So I'm zooming in now on a pair of galaxies that are merging together, interacting. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2511.84s)]
*  You can see that they're disturbed because the gravity of one galaxy yanks the stars [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2517.36s)]
*  out of the other galaxy. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2522.52s)]

*  Robertson, of the University of California Santa Cruz, helps lead Webb's most ambitious [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2526.88s)]
*  mission, the Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2533.4s)]
*  Well, we've discovered the most distant galaxy in the universe, the one that is the furthest [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2538.64s)]
*  away from us that we currently know about. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2543.9199999999996s)]
*  I'd like to share that with you. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2546.3999999999996s)]
*  Can I show you some pictures? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2547.3999999999996s)]
*  Please. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2548.3999999999996s)]

*  And now this red splotch that you see there, that galaxy, that's a galaxy, that galaxy [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2554.08s)]
*  is more than 33 billion light years away. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2560.24s)]
*  How long after the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe, did this galaxy form? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2565.1s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2570.5s)]
*  It's only 320 million years after the Big Bang. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2571.5s)]
*  The most distant galaxy so far, there on the right, doesn't look like much, but astronomers [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2575.34s)]
*  can fill textbooks by analyzing the spectrum of its light. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2581.9s)]
*  So we can actually measure things like how fast it's forming stars. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2587.74s)]
*  We can measure the amount of stars in the galaxy. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2591.74s)]
*  We know the size because we know how far away it is. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2593.94s)]
*  And we know the typical age of the stars in the galaxy. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2597.18s)]
*  So we know a lot. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2599.78s)]
*  The earliest galaxy so far formed when the universe was 2% of its current age, and the [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2601.18s)]
*  baby galaxy ignited stars at a furious pace. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2607.82s)]
*  It's like a hummingbird. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2613.3s)]
*  You know, the heartbeat of this galaxy is so rapid. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2614.66s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2617.62s)]
*  Well, this galaxy is forming stars at about the rate of the Milky Way, even though it's [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2618.82s)]
*  100 times less massive. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2623.54s)]
*  So it really is like a hummingbird. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2626.1s)]
*  The heartbeat of this galaxy is racing. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2627.66s)]
*  T-minus 30 seconds and counting. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2630.74s)]
*  More than a few human hearts were racing in 2021 as the $10 billion observatory readied [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2632.74s)]
*  for launch. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2640.34s)]
*  Wow. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2643.1s)]
*  Earlier that year, we were among the last to see Webb in California before it was folded [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2645.42s)]
*  into a 15-foot wide nose cone. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2651.74s)]
*  Well, somehow that's a lot bigger than I imagined. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2654.9399999999996s)]
*  Twenty-five years in the making, Webb is named for an early NASA administrator. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2659.2599999999998s)]
*  Northrop Grumman engineer Amy Lowe showed us down below the silver-colored sunshield, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2665.8199999999997s)]
*  big as a tennis court, and 21 feet of gold-plated mirrors for gathering light. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2673.1s)]
*  There are 18 of these hexagonal mirrors, but when you fold them out, they all work in concert [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2680.5s)]
*  as one mirror. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2688.54s)]
*  That's right. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2689.54s)]
*  All 18 images will form one very nice solid image. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2690.54s)]
*  And liftoff. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2697.46s)]
*  Lift off. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2698.46s)]
*  Decolage. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2699.46s)]
*  Decolage. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2700.46s)]
*  Liftoff. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2701.46s)]
*  From a tropical rainforest to the edge of time itself, James Webb begins a voyage back [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2702.46s)]
*  to the birth of the universe. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2706.46s)]
*  Webb lofted on a European rocket into an orbit around the sun a million miles away. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2708.78s)]
*  To set up for observations, engineers used a star to align those mirrors, but the image [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2716.34s)]
*  was speckled with what looked like artifacts of digital noise, which forced a closer look. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2723.42s)]
*  These were not artifacts from the detector. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2731.46s)]
*  These were not strange stars. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2733.6200000000003s)]
*  The whole of the sky was filled with galaxies. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2736.34s)]
*  There was no empty sky. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2739.6600000000003s)]
*  And that's when I went, this telescope's going to be phenomenal. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2741.98s)]
*  Matt Mountain leads Webb's operations as president of the Association of Universities for Research [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2745.58s)]

*  No empty sky. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2754.42s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2755.42s)]
*  In almost every image we're taking now, we see galaxies everywhere. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2757.2200000000003s)]
*  We took a simple picture of a planet, our own system, Neptune. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2761.9s)]
*  It was this beautiful orb just sitting there, and we saw some rings. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2766.62s)]
*  And the background? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2770.38s)]
*  A galaxy again. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2771.38s)]
*  It tells us that our universe is filled with galaxies. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2773.44s)]
*  We knew this theoretically. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2776.54s)]
*  But when you go out to the night sky, we're used to saying, well, look up at the night [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2779.1800000000003s)]
*  sky, we see those stars. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2783.1s)]
*  We can no longer say that. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2784.38s)]
*  We now have to say, look up at the night sky, and there are galaxies everywhere. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2785.38s)]
*  We call it space because we thought there was nothing out there. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2790.74s)]
*  There is no empty sky with James Webb. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2794.22s)]
*  That is what we have discovered. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2796.4599999999996s)]
*  Matt Mountain says that Webb is a reminder of how much we do not know. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2798.2599999999998s)]
*  For example, galaxies are rushing away from each other at greater and greater speed, defying [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2803.8199999999997s)]
*  gravity. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2810.58s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2811.62s)]
*  So scientists infer that there must be unseen elements at work. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2813.5s)]
*  They call them dark energy and dark matter. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2818.62s)]
*  And whenever you hear the term dark energy or dark matter, this means we don't know [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2822.2999999999997s)]

*  We're not that imaginative. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2828.7799999999997s)]
*  But it is a force. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2829.94s)]
*  It is 95% of our universe, and we have no idea what it is. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2830.94s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2837.74s)]
*  95% of our universe is made up of dark energy and dark matter, and we don't know what it [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2838.74s)]

*  And that's what Webb is most sensitive to for our purposes. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2925.34s)]
*  To see what's happening inside the explosion that we couldn't see before because it only [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2929.62s)]
*  comes out in infrared light. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2934.46s)]
*  Infrared light is what Webb is designed to see. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2938.02s)]
*  Like a night vision camera, the telescope is sensitive to heat radiation, which is all [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2941.5s)]
*  that remains of the light reaching us from the dawn of time. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2947.7799999999997s)]
*  Trouble is, infrared is invisible to the human eye. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2952.2599999999998s)]
*  When you first pull up the Webb data, what does that look like? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2957.74s)]
*  Essentially, it looks like a blank screen. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2962.2999999999997s)]
*  Alisa Pagan and Joe DiPasquale are astronomers and science imagers for the Space Telescope [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2965.8199999999997s)]
*  Science Institute. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2973.8999999999996s)]
*  This is what a Webb infrared picture looks like until they match the data-filled darkness [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2976.14s)]
*  to colors of wonder. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2983.2999999999997s)]
*  We take those longest wavelengths of infrared light and give those the red colors. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2986.18s)]
*  The next shortest wavelengths would be green and then the shortest wavelengths that we [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2989.94s)]
*  get from Webb are colored blue. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2993.14s)]
*  And so just like how our eyes work, we take those three color channels, combine them together [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2995.14s)]
*  to create the full color images that we see from Webb. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=2999.2799999999997s)]
*  Among their favorite images is this cluster of stars with the not so wondrous name NGC [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3002.8199999999997s)]
*  346. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3010.1s)]
*  Cosmic dust sculpted into ripples by interactions between stars. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3012.38s)]
*  And the Tarantula Nebula, a star-birthing nursery on a backdrop of galaxies. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3019.02s)]
*  It occurs to me you're the first two people to see these images in human history. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3027.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3031.42s)]
*  It's quite an honor. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3032.42s)]
*  It is a great honor. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3033.42s)]
*  And it does blow your mind every time. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3034.42s)]
*  There will be many mind-blowing revelations. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3036.78s)]
*  Webb is already the first to find carbon dioxide in the sky of a planet 700 light-years away. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3039.9s)]
*  It will continue to look for planets with atmospheres that might support life. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3047.9s)]
*  On the other end of the time scale, astrophysicist Erica Nelson of the University of Colorado [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3054.14s)]
*  Boulder thinks her team may have made a discovery that she says would break the theory of how [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3060.0s)]
*  the early universe formed. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3068.1000000000004s)]
*  Either this is wrong or this is a huge discovery. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3070.94s)]
*  And we think that it's a huge discovery. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3076.46s)]
*  More observations are needed, but Nelson is investigating what may be five giant galaxies [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3079.6200000000003s)]
*  that appear to have formed much too quickly after the Big Bang. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3086.6600000000003s)]
*  If they're confirmed, astronomy may have to revise the timeline of galaxy formation. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3091.62s)]
*  And that's the most exciting piece of this, of this telescope, of this remarkable instrument [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3098.56s)]
*  we put in space, is finding things that we didn't expect, that we can't explain, because [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3104.42s)]
*  that means that we have to revise our understanding of the universe. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3109.94s)]
*  Brant Robertson, who showed us the earliest galaxy found so far by the James Webb Telescope, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3114.98s)]
*  told us the record for the earliest will not hold long. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3121.3s)]
*  How far back can you go to the origins of the universe? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3125.5s)]
*  Well, JWST is so phenomenal that if you spend enough time, you could probably find any galaxy [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3129.26s)]
*  that ever formed in the universe. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3134.5800000000004s)]
*  It's really that powerful. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3136.7400000000002s)]
*  Will the history of astronomy be divided between before Webb and after Webb? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3138.44s)]
*  Yes, I believe it will be. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3143.6200000000003s)]
*  Matt Mountain, who manages Webb Operations, told us the observatory may last up to 25 [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3146.46s)]
*  years, perhaps long enough to comprehend space and time and the origins of life. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3152.9s)]
*  We're seeing a universe we've never seen before. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3161.54s)]
*  We thought it was there, we hoped it was there, but now we see it for the first time. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKY33sSSWY&t=3166.26s)]
