# Advancements in prosthetics limb technology; The Girls of SOLA | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [July 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64)
*  17 years ago, the Defense Department launched a $100 million project to revolutionize prosthetic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=0.0s)]
*  limbs. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=15.4s)]
*  The robotics that investment inspired is amazing, but even more remarkable is how the feeling [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  of feeling is returning to people's lives. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=24.5s)]
*  I can feel it. I feel it here and here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=29.88s)]
*  What has happened to the women of Afghanistan since the American military left Kabul? To [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  find out, we went, of course, to Rwanda. Yes, Rwanda. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=42.96s)]
*  This is the story of a brave Afghan woman who helped evacuate more than 200 Afghan girls [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=51.72s)]
*  and educators to safety in Africa, where they're studying in hopes of one day returning to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=58.0s)]
*  their homeland. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=64.36s)]
*  You think that you'll become leaders? Yes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=65.8s)]
*  I want to be a surgeon. I want to help poor people in Afghanistan. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=69.48s)]
*  I want to be a politician. A politician? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=74.2s)]
*  Yeah. And finally, from Zara... [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=76.8s)]
*  I want to be a spy. A spy? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=79.44s)]
*  Yeah. I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=82.12s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=87.64s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=89.92s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. I'm Scott Pelly. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=92.48s)]
*  Those stories tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=95.48s)]
*  We don't often think about how the sense of touch makes our lives possible. We grip a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  paper coffee cup with perfect force to hold it but not crush it. Our feet always find the floor. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=112.24s)]
*  But for people with artificial limbs or those with spinal injuries, the loss of touch can put the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=120.0s)]
*  world beyond their grasp. 17 years ago, the Defense Department launched a $100 million project to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=126.32s)]
*  revolutionize prosthetic limbs. The robotics you're about to see is amazing, but as we first reported [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=134.24s)]
*  earlier this year, even more remarkable is how the feeling of feeling is returning to people like [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=141.44s)]
*  Brandon Prestwood. For me it was a battle if I wanted to live or die. You weren't sure you wanted to live? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=148.8s)]
*  No. I didn't know if I wanted to or not. Brandon Prestwood's battle began with the loss of his [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=160.88s)]
*  left hand. In 2012, he was on a maintenance crew reassembling an industrial conveyor belt [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  when someone turned it on. My arm was dragged in pretty much up to the shoulder. It crushed my bones [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=178.56s)]
*  in my arm and fed my arm through a gap about one inch. How did they save your life? The other [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=185.6s)]
*  maintenance guys jumped in. They started basically taking the machine back apart. Once we got it back [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=193.12s)]
*  apart, I could look in and see what was there. One of the gentlemen was a Vietnam veteran. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=198.88s)]
*  And the Vietnam veteran knew what to do. Yeah. The Vietnam veteran knew tourniquets, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=214.32s)]
*  but Prestwood lost his hand and couldn't return to his job. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  You'll eat this? Yeah, that sounds good. After four years with a hook, he told his wife Amy he [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  wanted to volunteer for experimental research involving surgery at the VA. I was not 100% on [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=231.52s)]
*  board to start with, but I knew he had his mind set that he had to do this and I couldn't hold him [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=239.36s)]
*  back. Six years later, thanks to Defense Department and VA projects, Prestwood controls [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=247.68s)]
*  this hand with nothing but his thoughts. Everything still feel good? Probably when I get her turned [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=255.36s)]
*  around. Electrodes implanted in muscles in his arm pick up his brain's electrical signals for [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=262.88s)]
*  movement. A computer translates those signals to the hand. How about the middle finger now? Sensors [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=270.32s)]
*  in the plastic fingers are connected to nerves in his arm to return a basic sense of touch. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=276.96s)]
*  Close your eyes, tell me when you're feeling me, too. Which he can demonstrate with his eyes closed. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=284.56s)]
*  Pinky, index, that's not bad. Middle, still requires a little bit, but it's not bad. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=290.24s)]
*  Biomedical engineer Dustin Tyler leads this research at Case Western Reserve University [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  and the Cleveland VA. Touch is about connection. It's connection to the world, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=304.88s)]
*  it's about connection to others, and it's connection to yourself, right? I mean, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=308.96s)]
*  we never experience not having touch. It's the largest sensory organ on our body. All right, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=314.48s)]
*  so go ahead. Tyler first attempted an artificial connection in 2012. He switched it on in a volunteer [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=319.76s)]
*  and wondered what would happen. So I was concerned, would it be his whole hand? Would it be painful? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=328.24s)]
*  Would it not feel anything? We had no idea. So one of those big moments in my career was he came in, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=333.68s)]
*  we first turned on the stimulus, and he kind of stopped for a second and he goes, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=340.16s)]
*  that's my thumb. That's the tip of my thumb. This happened right away. It didn't require any [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=344.56s)]
*  training of the brain. No, that was the beauty of it. My thumb. Brandon Presswood remembers the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=351.68s)]
*  instant it happened to him. That's my fingers. I'm feeling my fingers that I don't have anymore. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=358.64s)]
*  I'm feeling them. A definite feeling, he told us, but different. It doesn't feel exactly like my [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=366.32s)]
*  right hand. It's a tingling sensation. It's not painful. It's kind of like if your if your hand's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=373.44s)]
*  been asleep right at the end, right before it wakes up, that very, for me, it's pleasant. It's a [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  pleasant tingling. Let's see if you can do a cherry here. A tingling that's light with a light [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=387.44s)]
*  touch, but grows stronger the harder he presses. Eyes closed. He can pinch a cherry firmly enough [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=392.16s)]
*  to pull it from its stem, but not crush it. You can feel this is light. I had to use my lightest [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=400.4s)]
*  touch. So if I hold this right here. With an empty eggshell. I can feel that. I feel it in, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  I feel it here and here. It's a feeling more than a decade in the making. At the beginning of this [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=413.52s)]
*  research, how did you even imagine that this would be possible? I didn't imagine. I thought, I [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=420.4s)]
*  imagined it was not going to be possible. Sleeman Benzmea at the University of Chicago is among the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  world's leading experts on the neuroscience of touch. In 2008, he joined the Defense Department's [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=432.4s)]
*  project to revolutionize prosthetics, but he didn't think the Pentagon knew what it was up against. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=439.76s)]
*  There are a hundred billion neurons in the brain interconnected with a hundred trillion synapses. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=446.64s)]
*  I mean, the human brain is like the most complex system in the known universe. Too complex, he [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=453.12s)]
*  believed, to target electrical stimulation to exactly the right neurons. And when we electrically [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=459.84s)]
*  stimulate, we activate hundreds, thousands of them at the same time in ways that would never [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=466.72s)]
*  happen naturally. It just seemed like that very impoverished interface with this nervous system [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  would never be able to do anything useful. And turns out I was wrong. He was proved wrong by [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=480.56s)]
*  his own research. How you doing, Scott? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Scott. With volunteers, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=486.72s)]
*  including Scott Embry. And you can feel that. I feel it on my fingertips. Whose movement and [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=492.64s)]
*  sense of touch are limited by a spinal injury from a car accident. Computer ports in Embry's skull [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=498.96s)]
*  are wired to the motor and sensory parts of his brain. Electrodes pick up the brain's electrical [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=507.52s)]
*  signals that were intended for the muscles. A computer translates those signals to the robot arm. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  We first saw this brain machine interface 10 years ago at the University of Pittsburgh. But [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=522.88s)]
*  back then, there was no sensation. Index finger. In collaboration with Pitt, neuroscientist [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=529.84s)]
*  Sleeman Benzmea showed that signals for touch could be returned to the brain. How can you [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=537.28s)]
*  possibly know what part of the brain is the tip of the index finger? We took Scott and we put him [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=545.28s)]
*  in a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. And then we had him imagine moving his thumb, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=554.64s)]
*  imagine moving his index, imagine moving his digits as we monitored his brain activity. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  And lo and behold, the sensory and motor parts of the brain that are involved in the hand [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=568.48s)]
*  lit up. Middle. Brain. Index. There are challenges. Eventually, the brain builds scar tissue at the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=575.28s)]
*  implants, limiting the motor electrodes. But one patient's implants have lasted eight years and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=588.16s)]
*  counting. Scott Embrys had been working more than two years. You have been a subject of this work [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  for years now. And I wonder why. I wanted to have someone else have the opportunity to become [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=604.4s)]
*  independent again. The most meaningful work of your life. Yes, sir. 100%. The greatest independence [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=612.56s)]
*  might be no prosthetic at all. And we saw this astounding possibility with a pioneer, Austin [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=620.88s)]
*  Beggen. His brain impulses are rooted not to a robot, but to implants in his own arm that fire [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=629.2s)]
*  his muscles. What function did you have in this hand before the implants? Oh, absolutely none. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=637.68s)]
*  Nothing. You couldn't move it at all. No. So the only thing I can do really is shrug my shoulders [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=645.28s)]
*  and kind of shift them. Unfortunately, that was all that came back after my accident. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=651.76s)]
*  His accident was on a vacation celebrating his college graduation. Diving into a submerged sand [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  bar left him quadriplegic. Now motor and sensory impulses flow through the ports in Beggen's skull [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=666.24s)]
*  and a computer, bypassing his damaged spine. Relax, close. The research is led by Bolu Ajiboye, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=675.04s)]
*  a biomedical engineer at Case Western Reserve University. Our goal is to restore complete [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=684.24s)]
*  functionality of the upper arm, including dexterous hand function and the ability to reach out so that [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=690.56s)]
*  Austin and others who have suffered severe spinal cord injury can regain some level of [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=696.7199999999999s)]
*  functional independence. The cradle under his arm only supports the weight. All of the motion [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=702.08s)]
*  is his own. It takes effort. He has to concentrate. A little bit quicker. Open hand, relax hand, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=710.32s)]
*  close hand, relax hand, open hand, relax hand. And the computer needs frequent adjustment. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=717.84s)]
*  How'd that feel? Good. But his parents, Shelly and Brad, showed us where this could lead. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=726.1600000000001s)]
*  Carrot or would you like to have a nice granola bar? I'll take the granola bar. I figured. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=734.24s)]
*  Beggen retained limited feeling after his injury, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=743.6800000000001s)]
*  which makes him ideal for evaluating the artificial sense of touch. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=747.2s)]
*  Point of finger. So if I can extend first. His motor skills. Let me open my hand for you. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=752.88s)]
*  Continue to grow. Squeeze around it. You'll feel me really start to dig in right there. You got a grip. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=759.12s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. I'm letting go. Yeah. I'm bringing the arm back up. Congratulations. Yeah, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=765.12s)]
*  thank you. Thank you so much. Amazing. Amazing advances are coming quickly. Danny Werner lost [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=771.04s)]
*  his foot in Vietnam. It's on. But 47 years later, he was reconnected to touch in an artificial foot. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=778.96s)]

*  Brandon Prestwood's next device will replace some wiring with Bluetooth connections. Especially the [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=796.08s)]

*  But an eventual commercial system may cost significantly less [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=811.52s)]

*  What did that mean to you to feel Amy's hand in yours? The world. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=824.88s)]
*  I was a whole person again. I didn't have to worry about those dark thoughts creeping back in. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=830.16s)]
*  It's just giving me back my husband who means the world to me. He's his self again. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=838.88s)]
*  Himself, because the feeling of feeling is so much of what makes us human. Maybe that's why [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=847.9200000000001s)]
*  maybe that's why when we see a tender moment, it is said to be touching. I love you. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=855.76s)]
*  Following the breakthroughs in prosthetics. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=869.8399999999999s)]

*  Whatever your view of the U.S. decision to end America's longest war and withdraw troops from [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=877.28s)]
*  Afghanistan, that country's fall to the Taliban in August of 2021 has unquestionably plunged that [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=889.12s)]
*  nation once again into a deep crisis. Millions are facing famine and the economy is in shambles. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=896.88s)]
*  Those suffering the most are Afghan women and girls. The Taliban has closed girl schools beyond [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=905.28s)]
*  sixth grade and barred women from universities. That means that girls are banned from anything [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=913.04s)]
*  beyond a grade school education. Tonight, though, we're going to tell you a story of hope about a [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=919.76s)]
*  group of Afghan girls who are in school. As we first reported in February, they're at a school [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=926.88s)]
*  called Sola, the Afghan word for peace and also short for School of Leadership Afghanistan. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=933.52s)]
*  It was started by a young Afghan woman named Shabana Basish Rasook who knows firsthand the [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=942.0s)]
*  power of an education. And though they had to flee Afghanistan in a harrowing escape, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=948.56s)]
*  we found the girls of Sola back in the classroom, half a world away. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=955.04s)]
*  These are the busy streets of Kigali, Rwanda, a landlocked African nation that was once the [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=960.4000000000001s)]
*  site of a horrific genocide that killed nearly a million and left two million refugees. Rwanda is [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=969.84s)]
*  now at peace and has become an unlikely place of refuge for almost two years to the girls of Sola. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=977.2800000000001s)]
*  And they seem to be settling in. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=985.6s)]
*  The evening we arrived at Sola's temporary campus here, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=990.72s)]
*  the sixth and seventh grades were holding a geography competition. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=994.5600000000001s)]
*  Classes here are taught in English. The girls were racing to identify nearly 200 countries [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1000.5600000000001s)]
*  all around the globe. They're wearing masks not to protect against COVID, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1008.24s)]
*  but to hide their identities to protect their families still in Afghanistan. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1013.28s)]
*  My name is Zahra. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1018.24s)]
*  Zahra's family has left the country so she can show her face. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1019.68s)]
*  Sariahs and Najias are still there. You knew every country in the world. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1024.08s)]
*  You like it. You like contests. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1031.52s)]
*  They're so passionate. They're so active. They're so eager. They're so interested. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1035.92s)]
*  Shabana Basij Rasook is Sola's founder and single-minded leader. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1041.12s)]
*  How are you all doing? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1046.32s)]
*  At 32 and just over five feet tall, Shabana started creating Sola when she was still a [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1048.32s)]
*  student herself. Her story and her commitment to educating girls goes back to 1996, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1055.04s)]
*  when Afghanistan fell to the Taliban the first time. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1063.52s)]
*  She was six years old and all girls' schools were closed. But Shabana's parents, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1067.68s)]
*  a former general and an educator, refused to keep their daughters locked up at home. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1073.92s)]
*  They heard about a secret school run out of a former principal's living room and saw an [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1080.24s)]
*  opportunity, despite the danger, for Shabana and her older sister to be educated. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1085.6000000000001s)]
*  The Taliban did not allow women to go outside alone, so my parents dressed me up as a boy so [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1091.92s)]
*  that I could accompany my sister to and from that secret school. That was the best way that both of [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1098.24s)]
*  us could receive an education. Oh my god. So they dressed you as a boy. My mom cut my hair. I wore [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1103.28s)]
*  boys' clothes. Pants. Pants and t-shirt and, yep, buzz cut. And the family carefully mapped out their [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1112.24s)]
*  routes. You know, you take different streets every day so you don't create a routine. The same [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1119.76s)]
*  shopkeeper at a certain convenience store should not notice you every day. So you were always [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1125.52s)]
*  afraid or they were always afraid you'd get caught. They never knew when or if we would return home. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1131.2s)]
*  But even after a close call where Shabana and her sister were followed and begged their parents to [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1138.48s)]
*  stop sending them to school, her mom and dad said no. They told us things like you could be [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1144.8s)]
*  forced to leave your home. You could be forced to become a refugee. You could lose any material [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1150.96s)]
*  possessions that you have, but the one thing that can never be taken away from you is your education. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1156.3999999999999s)]
*  When the Taliban fell after the U.S. invasion in 2001, Shabana went to a real school for the [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1164.72s)]
*  first time, and she excelled, winning a place in a State Department program to spend a year of high [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1171.76s)]
*  school in the U.S. I was randomly placed with this lovely host family in Wisconsin, where I gained 40 [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1178.64s)]
*  pounds. But that wasn't the only way the year changed her. What struck me the most was living [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1186.8799999999999s)]
*  in a society for the first time in my life where girls had no concerns whatsoever that their freedom [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1194.24s)]
*  to attend school could be taken away from them anytime, which is something that every single [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1204.0s)]
*  Afghan girl who's lucky enough to go to school lives with. And you can't blame them, can you? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1209.92s)]
*  No, I can't because Afghanistan is the only country in the world that won't let girls go to school. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1216.0s)]
*  Yeah, so... [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1223.52s)]
*  Why are you tearing up? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1231.76s)]
*  That Afghanistan's the only country? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1236.4s)]
*  Shabana's commitment to her homeland runs deep. When she got a scholarship to attend [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1241.28s)]
*  Middlebury College in Vermont, she started working not on building a great life for herself in the [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1246.8s)]
*  U.S., but what she could do for Afghanistan. Her answer? Start a school. And by the time she [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1253.04s)]
*  graduated in 2011, an early version of SOLA was already up and running in Kabul. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1260.8799999999999s)]
*  I heard that it's different. It's a leadership program. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1268.08s)]
*  Fatima was an early SOLA student. You were encouraged to speak up? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1271.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1276.1599999999999s)]
*  You liked that? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1277.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1278.3999999999999s)]
*  I was like, wow. I thought like it's such an awesome school. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1279.8600000000001s)]
*  Fatima's two younger sisters, Aideen and Sajah, took notice. Sajah got in next. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1284.5800000000002s)]
*  And I was like, well, next year it's my turn. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1291.6200000000001s)]
*  Aideen remembers trying to impress Shabana, the school's founder, in her interview. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1294.42s)]
*  I was like reading a lot of books and I was writing their summaries down. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1299.94s)]
*  And I was like, you know what? I should take this and show her. Like, I'm a smart kid. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1303.8600000000001s)]
*  It worked. Aideen started as a sixth grader in 2016, the year SOLA expanded to become a full [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1310.18s)]
*  fledged sixth to twelfth grade girls boarding school, the only one in Afghanistan funded as [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1318.26s)]
*  a U.S. nonprofit through grants and donations. There were daily assemblies and the school's [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1325.14s)]
*  own special Pledge of Allegiance. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1331.14s)]
*  We all are Afghans. We love Afghanistan. We will try our best and work hard to improve this [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1333.94s)]
*  beautiful country. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1338.9s)]
*  Shabana's goal was both to educate her students and serve the nation by training a generation [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1340.5800000000002s)]
*  of leaders from Afghanistan's various regions and religious sects. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1346.98s)]
*  My roommate was Shia and I was Sunni and it was my first time to talk to a Shia girl. And it was [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1352.3400000000001s)]
*  so interesting to hear from her. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1359.06s)]
*  Do you deliberately want the children of conservative families? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1361.06s)]
*  We certainly create an environment in which even the most conservative families in Afghanistan [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1365.7s)]
*  would feel comfortable sending their daughters. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1372.34s)]
*  Do they? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1374.8999999999999s)]
*  They do. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1375.7s)]
*  Do you teach the Quran? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1376.58s)]
*  We do. For these young women to be effective leaders of Afghanistan, they have to be great [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1378.1799999999998s)]
*  Muslims, great Afghans, and highly educated. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1384.58s)]
*  At the start of 2021, SOLA was thriving. Shabana had secured land in Kabul and construction was [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1388.26s)]
*  underway on a new campus. There were a record number of applications with students enrolled [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1396.74s)]
*  from all over the country. And SOLA graduates were doing just what Shabana had envisioned. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1403.14s)]
*  Fatima had finished college and was working at the Afghan Ministry of Finance. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1409.8600000000001s)]
*  I was a professional woman. I was contributing. I also had all my friends [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1415.46s)]
*  who were educated women and men as well. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1420.42s)]
*  So there was a little community. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1422.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1424.66s)]
*  But the Trump administration had been negotiating with a newly emboldened Taliban, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1425.94s)]
*  promising a withdrawal of U.S. troops. And then in April of 2021, President Biden announced an [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1431.46s)]
*  unconditional exit. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1439.38s)]
*  I've concluded that it's time to end America's longest war. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1441.06s)]
*  It's time for American troops to come home. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1445.3s)]
*  I knew then that it was a matter of time before it was going to be irresponsible of me [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1447.86s)]
*  to run an all-girls boarding school in Kabul. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1454.82s)]
*  She came up with the idea of taking the whole SOLA community, students, and staff abroad for [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1458.26s)]
*  a semester while the American withdrawal played out. So she started searching for a country, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1465.54s)]
*  ideally one nearby, that would accept them. But the warmest response she got by far was from [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1471.7s)]
*  Rwanda. And she grabbed it. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1479.7s)]
*  To Rwanda? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1482.1s)]
*  You were going to go to a place called Rwanda? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1482.6s)]
*  No. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1485.3s)]
*  Did you know anything? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1485.8s)]
*  We all went and searched. And then we found out that it was in Africa. And I was like, wow. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1486.98s)]
*  Oh my God, I'm so excited. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1492.18s)]
*  Some of SOLA's alums, including Sajiya and Fatima, were asked to come as well. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1494.02s)]
*  So was the idea at that moment that you were escaping and that you weren't going to come back [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1499.7s)]
*  for a while? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1505.7s)]
*  No. The idea was that the security is getting worse. We would leave for a [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1506.5s)]
*  uni semester. And then if the security gets better, we would come back. If not, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1512.42s)]
*  we would stay there for a year or more. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1516.98s)]
*  But what was the atmosphere in Kabul at that point? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1518.9s)]
*  The provinces were falling one after another. But then we were not hoping for Kabul to fall [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1523.14s)]
*  this soon. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1531.54s)]
*  The U.S. government wasn't expecting Kabul to fall soon either. As American soldiers prepared [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1532.42s)]
*  for an announced end of August departure, SOLA brought in passport officials on August 14th [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1538.58s)]
*  to process the girls' paperwork for flights a few days later. They worked into the night, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1545.46s)]
*  but unbeknownst to all of them, it was too late. The Taliban were closing in and would [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1552.02s)]
*  enter Kabul in just a few hours. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1558.74s)]
*  It was 5 a.m. in the morning when I got a knock on my door. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1561.62s)]
*  One of my teachers came and said that you guys have to leave SOLA in five minutes. And I said [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1567.3s)]
*  that, why? I said if the Taliban come, they will know that here is a school and they will [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1573.06s)]
*  kill all of us. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1577.94s)]
*  All of the girls were shouting and all of us crying, what should we do? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1579.06s)]
*  Taliban came to Kabul and took all of Kabul. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1583.94s)]
*  In the chaos of the Taliban takeover and government collapse, SOLA quickly sent students [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1587.94s)]
*  home with teachers and staff. Shebana scrambled to transform what was to be an orderly departure [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1594.34s)]
*  into a sudden, life-threatening escape. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1602.5s)]
*  But first, she had to keep a promise, one she'd made years earlier to a student's father. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1605.3000000000002s)]
*  He said, promise me, when the Taliban come to Kabul, that you will burn my daughter's records. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1613.14s)]
*  If they find out that she's a student here, they will kill me and my family. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1622.1000000000001s)]
*  So Shebana did something heartbreaking, set fire in the school's furnace and courtyard [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1627.5400000000002s)]
*  to the hard-earned records of all of SOLA's students. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1635.3000000000002s)]
*  It was incredibly painful. It felt like making them disappear. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1639.8600000000001s)]
*  The girls of SOLA, their escape from Kabul and how they're doing today when we come back. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1648.1000000000001s)]
*  Most of us remember the desperate frantic crowds trying to get out of Kabul after the Taliban [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1656.9s)]
*  takeover in August 2021. Among them were the students, teachers, staff and staff families [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1672.5800000000002s)]
*  of SOLA, 256 people in all. SOLA's founder, Shebana Basish Rassouk, managed to get all of them [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1680.26s)]
*  on U.S. approved lists to leave the country. But getting them into the airport was another [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1689.62s)]
*  matter altogether. There were a series of Taliban checkpoints, so arriving together as a girl school [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1696.42s)]
*  was out of the question. SOLA divided the students into groups, with many posing as the children of [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1704.26s)]
*  staff members. The call went out for all the groups to head to the airport on the morning of August 17th. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1711.7s)]
*  The previous day had been chaos. People had been clinging to airplanes and crowds had descended on [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1723.22s)]
*  the airport. Sisters Fatima, Sajia and Aideen prepared to go there together. We had our masks. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1731.14s)]
*  We made sure our scarves are put tightly and we were wearing very long dresses. When we left, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1739.3000000000002s)]
*  my mom was telling us that make sure that you don't do eye contacts with the tulips. So we were just [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1745.7800000000002s)]
*  really scared and then it was just like... If I look down, they won't look at me. Yes. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1751.38s)]
*  By the time we got closer to the airport, it was so crowded. The weather is hot and I have this black [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1756.5s)]
*  scarf and black mask and it's suffocating. People was pushing each other and shouting [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1764.3400000000001s)]
*  and all of the babies crying. I saw Taliban that they were they were shooting the guns and also [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1771.14s)]
*  guns and also they were shooting guns like the bullets. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1778.74s)]
*  Someone took my scarf. It was in my head and then someone and the tulip saw me and I shouted [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1784.5s)]
*  and I said that they will kill me now. As a teacher quickly handed Najia a scarf, Fatima [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1791.22s)]
*  and her sisters were being jostled by the crowd. Everybody was pushing and in a moment I noticed [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1797.5400000000002s)]
*  my sisters aren't there. At one point she was gone. So now it's just the two of you. I remember [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1803.38s)]
*  sitting there and then crying and I was like, I didn't, I don't want to go. Can we just stop here? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1809.22s)]
*  You know, let's just go back. Honestly, I understand. I probably would have done just what you did. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1814.0200000000002s)]
*  It was a tragedy, you know, with women having like their very young kids. I was like, I just [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1820.5800000000002s)]
*  can't take this anymore. I really didn't know what to do because she was not listening to me and then [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1826.9s)]
*  one of Sula teachers came and told her that you gotta stand up, go or stay here forever. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1832.66s)]
*  And then I took her hand and then we met. The three sisters were among more than a hundred [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1839.94s)]
*  Sula students and staff, including Shabana, who made it into the U.S. military-controlled airport [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1845.8600000000001s)]
*  to safety that day and were processed to leave on waiting jets. Shabana was told her name was on a [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1853.0600000000002s)]
*  Taliban hit list, so she should get out right away with them. But all the other students and [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1860.42s)]
*  teachers were still stuck in the crowds outside. Shabana refused to go. I knew if I left, it was [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1867.14s)]
*  game over. Those who were stuck at different checkpoints had no way of getting through. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1875.8600000000001s)]
*  People were pushing us and there were... One of them was Zara. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1881.22s)]
*  Taliban was saying sit and there was no place to sit. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1884.74s)]
*  Zara's group and others had to turn back while Shabana spent a first sleepless night inside the [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1888.82s)]
*  airport. After two more days of waiting in these throngs, one last group of 52 was still stuck. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1895.7s)]
*  Shabana asked a U.S. Marine captain to accompany her out of the safety of the airport and back to [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1904.58s)]
*  the Taliban checkpoint. Captain Nicholas Gray grabbed two members of his team and said, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1911.86s)]
*  let's do this. You were in the airport and went out? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1918.02s)]
*  And then went back. This is what you do. You have 10-year-old girls, 11-year-old girls, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1921.1399999999999s)]
*  15-year-old girls stuck on the other side. You do anything you can to get them to safety. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1926.26s)]
*  And she pulled you? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1938.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1939.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. These pictures were taken as the very last group of students and Shabana, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1939.78s)]
*  after three days and two nights in that airport, boarded the military transport plane that would [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1946.66s)]
*  at last fly them away. She had managed to get everyone out, 256 people. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1953.1399999999999s)]
*  You have to say to yourself, I did it. It's over. I got everybody out. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1961.3s)]
*  It was finally having a moment to think about, oh, my God, this is it. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1967.46s)]
*  Oh, my God, this is it. So now you're looking to the future. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1976.66s)]
*  We're leaving, you know, and I was taking with me from Afghanistan some of the best educated girls, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1980.82s)]
*  women leaders in the making. I felt so heartbroken for our people, for Afghanistan. I felt heartbroken [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=1991.14s)]
*  for the very people who are leaving. They are some of the most wanted talent in Afghanistan. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2000.3400000000001s)]
*  And as soon as they step outside of this airport, they're going to be seen as unwanted refugees [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2006.42s)]
*  wherever they end up. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2013.3s)]
*  Hello. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2014.98s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2015.46s)]
*  But her students are having a completely different experience. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2017.46s)]
*  In Rwanda, they have been welcomed. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2021.6200000000001s)]
*  Good morning. How are you today? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2024.3400000000001s)]
*  We found them dressed in new school uniforms, since each of them had fled with just a backpack. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2026.5800000000002s)]
*  I love what you're wearing. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2033.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2035.22s)]
*  They're hand sewn with Rwandan patterns to honor their adopted home. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2036.1000000000001s)]
*  Do you like it here? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2041.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2042.5s)]
*  You wouldn't know they'd been away from their families for more than a year. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2043.88s)]
*  Sola's temporary campus here feels like a haven. It's a former hotel complex. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2050.2s)]
*  It's restaurant now a dining hall with classrooms converted from hotel suites. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2057.0s)]
*  They're getting on with the business of learning, mastering math terms [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2064.76s)]
*  in English. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2070.04s)]
*  With many of their Afghan teachers now resettled as refugees in other countries, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2074.44s)]
*  Sola has brought in new teachers from abroad. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2080.36s)]
*  This is a school for leadership. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2084.44s)]
*  You think that you'll become leaders? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2087.08s)]
*  I want to be a surgeon. I want to help poor people in Afghanistan. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2091.0s)]
*  I want to be a politician. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2095.64s)]
*  A politician? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2097.0s)]
*  Saraya wants to be an astronaut. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2099.0s)]
*  And finally from Zara. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2102.84s)]
*  I want to be a spy. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2104.84s)]
*  A spy? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2106.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2107.5600000000004s)]
*  That came out of nowhere. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2109.5600000000004s)]
*  How are the girls doing? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2112.44s)]
*  Our students, our girls have been consistently and remarkably focused. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2114.1200000000003s)]
*  It is beyond inspiring to see these young girls who know. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2119.6400000000003s)]
*  They have no idea when they are going to be able to reunite with their families. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2124.68s)]
*  But though they're more than 3,000 miles away, it is the 21st century. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2130.3599999999997s)]
*  One of the most striking scenes we saw here was the daily hour after classes end [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2138.04s)]
*  when girls can call their families. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2144.2799999999997s)]
*  Watching them scattered around the room is to feel the tremendous separation. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2148.2799999999997s)]
*  But Chibana also sees the closeness. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2154.3599999999997s)]
*  Yesterday I was watching swimming practice. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2158.8399999999997s)]
*  One of them said, I've been wanting to learn how to float for such a long time [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2162.3599999999997s)]
*  and I can finally do it today. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2166.6s)]
*  I asked her, I said, do you share these kinds of moments with your family? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2169.0s)]
*  She said, I share every single thing with my family. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2172.6s)]
*  And they are so happy for me. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2176.7599999999998s)]
*  They tell me that they are happy because I am happy. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2178.7599999999998s)]
*  The best is the week. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2185.08s)]
*  What's the reception been like in Rwanda? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2186.7599999999998s)]
*  Remarkable doesn't quite capture it. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2190.12s)]
*  I've had this conversation with so many Rwandans paying, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2192.44s)]
*  please don't forget we were also once refugees. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2195.64s)]
*  Here we are back in Rwanda. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2199.56s)]
*  You will go back home, but for the time being, welcome home to Rwanda. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2202.04s)]
*  Why does that happen? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2209.96s)]
*  Did I throw it? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2211.16s)]
*  No. And Earth, there is gravity. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2212.36s)]
*  Watching these girls learn, we were struck by the realization that they're among the [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2215.32s)]
*  only Afghan middle and high school girls out of a country of 40 million [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2222.2000000000003s)]
*  who are getting a formal education. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2227.7200000000003s)]
*  Title slide, picture, title, name. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2230.36s)]
*  But knowing how fortunate they are has made hearing the news from Afghanistan that much more [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2232.1200000000003s)]
*  painful. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2237.8s)]
*  Fatima's female co-workers at the Ministry of Finance have all been replaced. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2238.92s)]
*  My female colleagues received phone calls saying that they should send one of their male [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2244.84s)]
*  family members to work instead of them. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2250.36s)]
*  So wait a minute, they were being told to send male relatives to take their jobs? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2252.6000000000004s)]
*  As long as they can do the job, they should send them. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2258.6000000000004s)]
*  A year ago March, the Taliban announced that girls' schools would reopen. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2261.56s)]
*  Girls flocked in only to be told hours later to go home and stay there. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2268.04s)]
*  All over social media were videos of these young girls crying. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2277.16s)]
*  And then I was so mad on everybody for not doing anything. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2282.7599999999998s)]
*  You mean the rest of the world? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2288.12s)]
*  This bunch of men has taken the control of our entire country and then they're doing [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2289.8s)]
*  whatever they want. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2294.76s)]
*  Women have been ordered to cover themselves head to toe again. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2296.6800000000003s)]
*  They're banned from public parks and just months ago banned from universities as well. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2300.6800000000003s)]
*  History repeating itself. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2307.0s)]
*  And if there's one member of the solar community who understands what Afghan girls today are [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2311.1600000000003s)]
*  facing, it's Mariam, the school's long-time cleaning woman and now seamstress. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2316.52s)]
*  She knows the power of an education because she never got one. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2323.64s)]
*  The Taliban were in power at that time. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2329.64s)]
*  I mean the first time the Taliban were in power. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2332.04s)]
*  I was not allowed to go to school. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2334.68s)]
*  Girls could not study. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2336.84s)]
*  Mariam, can you read or write? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2338.52s)]
*  I would really like to, but I can't. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2343.16s)]
*  If I could have gone to school, I would have been very happy. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2345.72s)]
*  It was very hard for me. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2349.8799999999997s)]
*  But there is something that makes her happy these days. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2352.2s)]
*  Watching her ninth grade daughter, Zarmina, who is now a student at Sola. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2355.8799999999997s)]
*  Talking about Zarmina's future, we finally saw Mariam smile. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2361.56s)]
*  Are you proud of your daughter? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2366.3599999999997s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2368.6s)]
*  We cannot, under any circumstances, submit to Taliban's vision for Afghanistan. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2371.32s)]
*  And what does that mean for us? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2378.04s)]
*  It means continue to educate more Afghan girls. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2379.88s)]
*  But how? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2382.76s)]
*  Well, she's recruiting them over Zoom from Afghan refugee communities and camps [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2383.88s)]
*  in countries around the world to bring them here to Rwanda. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2390.2000000000003s)]
*  What should the U.S. government be doing, in your view? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2394.6s)]
*  The one thing that the U.S. policymakers cannot afford to do is to forget about Afghanistan. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2398.68s)]
*  Do not look away. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2406.04s)]
*  Do not look away from Afghanistan. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2407.8799999999997s)]
*  I cannot emphasize that enough. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2410.7599999999998s)]
*  And what she wants them to see alongside the ongoing tragedy in that country [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2413.96s)]
*  is Sola's vision, educated girls committed to one day being leaders of a different Afghanistan. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2419.64s)]
*  We all are Afghans, they say. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2429.08s)]
*  We love Afghanistan. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2433.0s)]
*  We will try our best and work hard to improve our beautiful country. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2434.9199999999996s)]
*  You say this every day. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2442.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2444.04s)]
*  We repeat it every day that it's in our heart. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2445.0s)]
*  Do you all think you'll go back? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2449.24s)]
*  Is it possible that you won't go back to Afghanistan? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2454.2s)]
*  Is it possible? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2458.8399999999997s)]
*  I spend every waking hour preparing for a return. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2462.44s)]
*  It will happen. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2469.0s)]
*  I've borrowed a stone from the airport. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2471.0s)]
*  I need to return. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2473.8799999999997s)]
*  Since our story first aired, Sola has continued to bring new Afghan students from around the [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2477.08s)]
*  world to Rwanda and is developing an online academy called Sola X. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2483.48s)]
*  And in June, Shabana spoke to the UN Security Council, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2490.04s)]
*  urging the world not to look away from the plight of Afghan girls. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2494.2s)]
*  I'm Lesley Stahl. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2507.48s)]
*  We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibVzg_SfT64&t=2508.84s)]
