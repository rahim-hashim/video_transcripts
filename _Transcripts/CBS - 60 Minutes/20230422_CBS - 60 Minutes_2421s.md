# California's marijuana fields; Weed in Colorado; A new direction on drugs | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [April 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es)
*  It's harvest season for California's largest cash crop, marijuana. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=0.0s)]
*  Valued at more than $11 billion, it's worth more than the state's grape and almond industries [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=18.92s)]
*  combined. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=24.64s)]
*  California grows more pot than any place in the country. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=26.4s)]
*  Three years ago, voters approved a ballot measure called Prop 64 in California. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=29.36s)]
*  It made marijuana legal for anyone over the age of 21. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=34.44s)]
*  Advocates said a regulated pot industry would push out the black market and generate more [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=38.76s)]
*  than a half billion dollars a year for the state. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  So has it worked? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=46.68s)]
*  Not quite. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=47.959999999999994s)]
*  We spent a week in a region of California that should be rolling in profits, the Emerald [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  Triangle. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=53.76s)]
*  What NAPA is to wine, the Triangle is to weed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=54.919999999999995s)]
*  Its Mediterranean climate and rich soil are famous for producing some of the highest quality [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=58.4s)]
*  marijuana in the world. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=63.36s)]
*  This might look like a home depot, but it's a pot processing plant and every one of those [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=67.06s)]
*  buckets is full of marijuana. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=72.56s)]
*  At the height of production, this room is the biggest legal pot stash in the country. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  How much cannabis is in this room? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=80.84s)]
*  There's several thousand pounds. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=83.96s)]
*  Several thousand pounds? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=85.55999999999999s)]
*  Yes, tens of thousands actually. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=86.55999999999999s)]
*  Mikey Steinmetz runs the Flocona factory. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  It packages weed from legal, state regulated farms in the Emerald Triangle to be shipped [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=91.72s)]
*  and sold around California to licensed stores. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  There is nothing like this anywhere else in the pot industry. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=100.72s)]
*  This is like Willy Wonka stuff, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we've been called that before, the Willy Wonka of weed. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  So you have to create and come up with all this stuff? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=110.52s)]
*  Everything. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=113.52s)]
*  And that's what the hardest part is, that like the technology and innovation is just [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=114.52s)]
*  starting to enter the space. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=117.72s)]
*  Forget those stereotypes about stoners. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=119.8s)]
*  Some of his workers came from Apple and Google. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  They precisely weigh joints, inspect buds like gems, and package it to look more like [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=125.96s)]
*  high-end cosmetics than cannabis. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=131.96s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=134.48s)]
*  It's a different one. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=135.48s)]
*  It's a pineapple wonder. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=136.48s)]
*  It smells pineapple-y? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=137.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=138.48s)]
*  $175 million in just one year to get this off the ground. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=140.44s)]
*  But despite all that, all along the supply chain, we found it's been far from a gold [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=144.48s)]
*  rush. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=150.56s)]
*  Is it a windfall? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=151.56s)]
*  Are you all of a sudden rich? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=152.56s)]
*  Are you making tons of profit? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=154.12s)]
*  No, candidly, like the regulated market has been a fraction of what everybody expected [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=156.0s)]
*  it to be. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=161.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=162.0s)]
*  You know, the retail market has been very slow to roll out. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=163.0s)]
*  The slow rollout is because of the strict limits on opening pot shops in California. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=166.56s)]
*  Although Prop 64 legalized marijuana across the state, it gave towns and cities the power [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=172.68s)]
*  to decide if pot businesses can open locally. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  80 percent said, not in my town. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  So we have less retailers than we do in Oregon, for example, in a state that has orders of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  magnitude larger. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=189.12s)]
*  Say that again. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=190.12s)]
*  You have less retailers in... [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=191.12s)]
*  There's less retailers in California than there are in the state of Oregon. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=192.12s)]
*  And remember, California growers can only legally sell their marijuana in California, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=195.92s)]
*  and licensed stores like this one in the Emerald Triangle are rare. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=201.68s)]
*  Give me a sense of kind of who the customers are who are walking in right now. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=206.04s)]
*  Our demographic is over 60. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  That is... [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we get a... [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  Are they old hippies or are they grandparents with joint pain? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  I would say they're both. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  But there's not enough stores like this that sell marijuana legally, and there's way too [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  much of it being grown. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  California grows 11 million more pounds than it can consume a year. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=226.44s)]
*  Prices have crashed and made things even more difficult for legal businesses like Flocona. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=231.32s)]
*  There's an insane surplus of marijuana. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=237.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  Is it possible that there are too many growers that we're producing too much weed in California? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=240.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, historically California has been the supply of the nation, right? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=245.92s)]
*  It's simply just the numbers don't add up. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=250.64s)]
*  It's also not adding up for licensed pot farmers in the Emerald Triangle. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=253.56s)]
*  We drove up what locals call the million-dollar highway into the heart of pot country. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=258.12s)]
*  For decades, pot farmers have hauled their weed on this winding, remote road. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=263.76s)]
*  A lot of it grown on family farms like Casey O'Neill's. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=268.36s)]
*  They've been here since the 70s. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=271.92s)]
*  Welcome to the farm. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=273.24s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=274.24s)]
*  What do you got here? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=275.24s)]
*  He has just 45 marijuana plants. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=276.24s)]
*  He calls them his ladies, and they're tucked between his rows of vegetables. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=278.52s)]
*  All the cannabis in this row is Strawberry Valley. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=283.04s)]
*  We've got char. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=285.04s)]
*  O'Neill, who spent time in jail for cultivating marijuana before it was legal, was one of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=286.04s)]
*  the first to get a license after Prop 64 passed. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=291.32s)]
*  I grow cannabis because I really love it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=295.16s)]
*  I like to consume it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=297.64000000000004s)]
*  I like to be around it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=298.8s)]
*  It's something that provides my being and consciousness with tremendous love and support. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  In the plant, his being and consciousness is getting strangled by red tape and a laundry [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=308.74s)]
*  list of requirements that don't make sense to growers, like weighing marijuana leaves, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=313.06s)]
*  which is the part of the plant you don't smoke and can't get you high. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=318.54s)]
*  I must take all of the leaf that comes off the plant. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=322.3s)]
*  I must weigh it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=324.66s)]
*  I must record the weight, and I must put it in a locked compost facility. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=325.66s)]
*  So it's just like, big brother has some funny ideas. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=329.38s)]
*  Because what's the worry with the leaves? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=334.18s)]
*  If you can't smoke the leaf, why does it matter? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=337.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=339.86s)]
*  Then there's the cost of operating legally, a major reason, O'Neill says, farmers he knows [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=340.86s)]
*  have decided to keep growing and selling marijuana illegally. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=347.18s)]
*  For most people out here, the opportunity to participate does not exist. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=351.58000000000004s)]
*  The barriers to entry are too high, the costs are too high, the skill sets are too low. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=355.5s)]
*  The flip side of it is people are not going to jail for cannabis. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=360.14000000000004s)]
*  What's the cost to you? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=365.29999999999995s)]
*  So, when you factor in consulting fees, I just did a back of the napkin calculation [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=367.17999999999995s)]
*  and over the last three, four years I'm well over $50,000 into it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=373.26s)]
*  $50,000 for what, permits? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=376.38s)]
*  For permits for consulting, $2,500 a year for the waterboard discharge permit. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  It's $750 a year for the pond permit. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=383.21999999999997s)]
*  It's $1,350 application fee to the county, plus another $675 when they actually give [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  you the permit annually. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=392.41999999999996s)]
*  For a farm this size? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=394.02s)]
*  For a tiny, for the smallest farm that there is. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=395.21999999999997s)]
*  And that's one of the problems is that... [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=398.18s)]
*  So what does that do to your profits? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=399.34s)]
*  What profits? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=401.78s)]
*  You're not making any money right now? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=402.78s)]
*  No. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=403.78s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=404.78s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=405.78s)]
*  So where's the money being made in California? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=406.78s)]
*  It turns out, in the very place legalization was supposed to destroy, the black market, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=410.74s)]
*  which often operates out of storefronts like this and strip malls around the state. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=417.14s)]
*  Those unlicensed shops don't have to pay for state and local permits and can sell marijuana [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=423.18s)]
*  much cheaper because they don't charge customers marijuana taxes, which can reach as high as [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=428.06s)]
*  45 percent. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=434.14s)]
*  So it's cheaper and easier to buy pot on the black market, which is three times larger [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=436.02s)]
*  than the legal one. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=441.7s)]
*  Unlike other industries, we have this kind of in the shadows, unspoken about competitor, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=443.3s)]
*  right? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=447.94s)]
*  And so it's like, it's not like California is fully raging, fully legal. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=448.94s)]
*  Really, we're building to a fully regulated state, but we're certainly not there yet. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=452.22s)]
*  To see the roots of the black market in the Emerald Triangle, it helps to get high. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=457.46000000000004s)]
*  Our guide was Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=463.62s)]
*  He's been chasing marijuana growers for 35 years. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=467.38s)]
*  Wow, this is a big operation. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=470.46000000000004s)]
*  Oh my goodness, this guy is going to make millions of dollars. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=472.94s)]
*  Allman told us those white canopies belong to illegal marijuana growers undercutting [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=476.06s)]
*  California's legal pot industry. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=481.26s)]
*  See all those shiny straight things? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=483.78000000000003s)]
*  Those are all marijuana growers. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=485.1s)]
*  How do you know they're not like tomatoes? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=486.42s)]
*  Because they're hidden in the woods. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=488.02s)]
*  Look right here. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=491.14s)]
*  I know those are not tomatoes. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=492.54s)]
*  OK, there's 12 of them right there. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=493.7s)]
*  I can guarantee you those are not tomatoes. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=495.66s)]
*  We were surprised they weren't camouflaged. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=498.38s)]
*  Allman explained since Prop 64 and the legalization of marijuana, the black market suppliers try [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=501.26s)]
*  to blend in with legal pot farmers, sometimes on the same property. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=507.14s)]
*  So the backers of Prop 64 said three things, right? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=512.6999999999999s)]
*  First they said, we're going to raise a half billion dollars in tax revenue. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=516.78s)]
*  Has that happened? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=521.38s)]
*  No. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=522.38s)]
*  They said it's going to eliminate the black market. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=523.38s)]
*  Has that happened? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=525.86s)]
*  The black market has greatly increased. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=527.1s)]
*  Has increased. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=530.18s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=531.18s)]
*  You said that this would now allow police officers like you to focus on other things. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=532.66s)]
*  I'm looking forward to that day. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=538.78s)]
*  Right now, his deputies are busy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=541.14s)]
*  There's so much illegal weed in areas that are so remote, they have to haul it away by [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=543.9s)]
*  helicopter. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=548.78s)]
*  Allman says he only has the manpower to get rid of about 10 percent of it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=550.2199999999999s)]
*  So what happens to the rest? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=554.66s)]
*  We learned much of it is being smuggled east to the 39 states where pot is still illegal [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=556.58s)]
*  and prices are three times higher than in California. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=562.74s)]
*  We've heard these reports from state police that say they're seeing larger shipments of [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=566.82s)]
*  marijuana moving east from California. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=570.7s)]
*  Have you heard about this? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=574.38s)]
*  So probably once a week we get a call. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=576.22s)]
*  It's usually some trooper back east, you know, at three in the morning who stopped the car [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=580.5400000000001s)]
*  for not having a taillight. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=584.66s)]
*  It says you won't believe it, you know, we got 35 or 40 pounds. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=585.66s)]
*  That's on the low end. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=589.78s)]
*  Throughout the year, we spoke to highway patrols across the center of the country. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=591.14s)]
*  They shared photos of hundreds of pounds of pot they've intercepted. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=595.14s)]
*  This 300 pound load was in Missouri. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=599.5s)]
*  This trailer in Idaho carried 800 pounds and 3,400 pounds were found in this haul in Texas. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=602.2199999999999s)]
*  Since Prop 64 was implemented, we were told by highway patrols in six states that they've [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=610.22s)]
*  seized up to three times more pot on their roads. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=615.58s)]
*  Did this all happen too fast? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=619.1s)]
*  Oh my goodness, of course it did. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=620.86s)]
*  It happened way too fast. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=622.82s)]
*  For the black market, it's been a gold rush. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=624.08s)]
*  I'm not saying that anybody, the organizers of Prop 64, intended this to happen the way [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=626.1s)]
*  it happened. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=632.58s)]
*  They just wanted to decriminalize marijuana. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=633.58s)]
*  But people have taken advantage. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=636.5s)]
*  Evan explained that Californians have little appetite to prosecute marijuana crimes, so [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=638.74s)]
*  he's had to get creative to go after the black market. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=644.0600000000001s)]
*  If I took someone to, in front of a jury, for growing a thousand plants illegally, no [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=647.86s)]
*  permits, no anything, I'm telling you there is no way in hell I'm going to get a conviction [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=652.9s)]
*  on cultivation of marijuana. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=658.32s)]
*  Marijuana on its face is part of our social fabric. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=660.32s)]
*  But if that same grower was stealing water and using pesticides and rodenticides and [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=664.62s)]
*  taking water from the river, that jury's going to hang him. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=672.58s)]
*  Most of you already know where the target is. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=676.22s)]
*  It's about 20 miles north of here. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=677.58s)]
*  To see that strategy at work, we went on a marijuana raid where agents from the Department [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=679.26s)]
*  of Fish and Wildlife were leading the way. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=684.74s)]
*  They took us down a dusty, bumpy road deep in the Emerald Triangle. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=690.3s)]
*  Their agents had been hiding in a forest for days, staking out an illegal grow. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=695.6999999999999s)]
*  With their guns out, they went in. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=703.06s)]
*  You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer any questions. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=705.38s)]
*  As cops questioned two workers, others went row by row chopping down a thousand plants. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=708.9799999999999s)]
*  Cops checked for illegal pesticides and documented how water was being stolen from a creek. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=716.86s)]
*  Those violations, which could result in fines up to $40,000 a day, may turn out to be the [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=722.58s)]
*  most effective weapon against black market growers. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=728.86s)]
*  Who would have thought that when we write a search warrant and we go out and serve it, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=732.78s)]
*  we would bring a biologist with us? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=737.0600000000001s)]
*  Now it's as important to us as bringing a gun. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=739.1s)]
*  Illegal grows now are manifesting, they're getting bigger, they're becoming more stubborn, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=741.98s)]
*  more acute. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=745.82s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom, who was a strong supporter of Prop 64, has said it [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=747.7800000000001s)]
*  could take seven years to get past the growing pains and stomp out the black market. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=751.86s)]
*  He's called in the National Guard to help by ordering units that were assisting the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=758.74s)]
*  Border Patrol near Mexico to move north to the Emerald Triangle where Casey O'Neill grows [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=762.82s)]
*  his pot. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=768.86s)]
*  So what happens if the National Guard shows up and here come the helicopters descending [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=769.98s)]
*  on the hills of the Emerald Triangle? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=775.18s)]
*  It's the same as it ever was. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=778.6999999999999s)]
*  What happens six months later? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=779.6999999999999s)]
*  What happens the day after they leave? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=781.9399999999999s)]
*  People replant. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=784.26s)]
*  Casey O'Neill may be right. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=785.26s)]
*  Six weeks after that raid we went on, cops went back to the exact spot and found 1,100 [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=789.26s)]
*  brand new marijuana plants. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=795.38s)]
*  Visit Colorado these days and you can smell change in the air. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=805.18s)]
*  It's the scent of legal marijuana for recreational use. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=813.3s)]
*  If you're a resident, 21 or older, you can walk into a state-licensed store and buy up [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=817.3s)]
*  to an ounce of pot. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=822.18s)]
*  Tourists are limited to a quarter ounce. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=824.54s)]
*  Colorado has allowed medical marijuana since 2001, but in 2012 voters amended the state [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=827.42s)]
*  Constitution to allow recreational pot and gave the government one year to make it work. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=833.98s)]
*  Colorado's governor calls it the most ambitious social experiment of the 21st century. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=841.26s)]
*  Three other states also have approved recreational pot, but none has gone further or faster into [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=846.58s)]
*  the legal retail weed business than Colorado. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=852.34s)]
*  The experiment just hit the one-year mark and we wanted to know how it's going. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=856.46s)]
*  So we headed to Denver, the epicenter of a marijuana industry that's now in full bloom. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=861.82s)]
*  Welcome to the Mile High City, where marijuana, long a symbol of the counterculture, now is [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=869.7800000000001s)]
*  just a part of everyday culture. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=875.86s)]
*  It's a Thursday night in downtown Denver and we were invited to a marijuana food and wine [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=880.58s)]
*  pairing catering to young professionals. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=886.0200000000001s)]
*  You might expect to see the band toking up, but here everybody is. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=888.98s)]
*  The food is sprinkled with marijuana, the wine infused with a strain called killer queen. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=896.94s)]
*  Budtender Leo Dunaive selected it for the evening. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=903.7s)]
*  Because of the mellowness of the strain, there isn't any kind of anxiety attached to it. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=907.54s)]
*  So that's why we have such a crowd of happy and fantastic people. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=910.98s)]
*  What we're doing there with that machine is it creates smoke that is cooled to minus 10 degrees [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=915.14s)]
*  and that smoke is then blown into this glass and that allows the wines to open up and really [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=921.6999999999999s)]
*  bring in the fruit forward qualities of it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=926.9s)]
*  Those who might remember pot from the 70s, the marijuana grown and sold in Colorado today [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=930.5799999999999s)]
*  is up to 10 times stronger. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=936.8199999999999s)]
*  There's a healthy appetite for the Rocky Mountain High and no shortage of stores to supply the demand. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=939.94s)]

*  and required new labeling detailing the potency of each serving. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1457.86s)]
*  But the biggest cloud over the industry is banking. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1462.3400000000001s)]
*  As long as the federal government continues to count pot proceeds as illegal drug money, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1466.1000000000001s)]
*  most banks won't touch it. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1471.7s)]
*  So Colorado's billion-dollar marijuana industry is conducted almost entirely in cash. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1473.78s)]
*  That's why Meg Sanders keeps a two-ton safe. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1482.02s)]
*  So you were, payroll was in cash? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1485.7s)]
*  Payroll, rent, taxes, licensing fees, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1487.3s)]
*  home depot, vendors, you name it, our electrician. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1490.18s)]
*  All in cash. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1493.3s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1494.3400000000001s)]
*  From a public safety standpoint, it's definitely the number one issue that this industry faces. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1495.14s)]
*  If you want to guarantee that a fledgling industry becomes corrupt [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1500.18s)]
*  and, you know, becomes populated with gang activity, fake it all cash, right? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1505.46s)]
*  That's as old as Al Capone, right? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1510.5s)]
*  Cash creates corruption. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1512.74s)]
*  Colorado governor John Hickenlooper says a partial solution to the problem [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1515.14s)]
*  might be a new state-chartered cannabis credit union. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1520.5s)]
*  He's urging the federal government to approve it. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1524.18s)]
*  Still, despite the problems, Governor Hickenlooper says [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1527.3799999999999s)]
*  he's encouraged by the rollout of this green experiment Colorado voters wanted. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1530.74s)]
*  In the beginning, you didn't think it was a good idea? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1536.1s)]
*  No, I opposed it. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1538.26s)]
*  You know, when I opposed it, I think even after the election, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1539.3s)]
*  if I'd had a magic wand and I could wave the wand, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1541.22s)]
*  I probably would have reversed it and had the initiative fail. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1544.8999999999999s)]
*  But now I look at it and I'm not so sure I'd do that even if I had such a wand. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1548.9s)]
*  I mean, I think we've made a lot of progress and, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1552.26s)]
*  you know, still a lot of work to be done, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1554.42s)]
*  but I think we might actually create a system that can work. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1556.1000000000001s)]
*  All right, I will have an eighth of that. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1559.6200000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1562.1000000000001s)]
*  Meg Sanders says marijuana is good for business. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1563.14s)]
*  It's pretty groovy, dude. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1566.26s)]
*  And good for Colorado. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1568.02s)]
*  Are you seeing a marijuana effect on the economy here? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1570.02s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1573.38s)]
*  You can't find an empty warehouse in the city of Denver, really. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1574.5s)]
*  You just can't. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1578.1s)]
*  And then think of the ripple effect. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1579.2199999999998s)]
*  I mean, we affect a ton of businesses, security, marketing, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1580.82s)]
*  web hosting. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1586.8999999999999s)]
*  We're a business just like anybody else. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1588.26s)]
*  We have the same needs. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1589.62s)]
*  Today, you can walk into a mindful dispensary and buy a joint for $14.53. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1591.78s)]
*  Business is good. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1598.1799999999998s)]
*  Sanders is planning to expand. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1599.9399999999998s)]
*  We're creating. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1602.5s)]
*  We're saying, please trust us. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1603.3799999999999s)]
*  We know we can do this right. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1604.58s)]
*  I do remember when this was rolled out. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1606.74s)]
*  Everyone thought that the sky was going to fall. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1608.26s)]
*  Still there. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1612.1000000000001s)]
*  It didn't fall. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1613.78s)]
*  And business is thriving, and the customers are still coming through the door. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1615.94s)]
*  So clearly, if I'm looking at my business and I'm looking at those around me, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1620.42s)]
*  the consumer is saying, yeah, this works. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1626.42s)]
*  After 40 years and a trillion dollars, the nation has little to show for its war on drugs. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1635.94s)]
*  Prisons are beyond crowded, and there's a new outbreak in the heroin epidemic. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1647.06s)]
*  If it's time for a change, it would be hard to find a leader more different than Michael Botticelli. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1652.42s)]
*  The president's new director of national drug control policy isn't a cop. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1658.3400000000001s)]
*  He's lucky he didn't go to jail himself. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1663.46s)]
*  And we knew that things had changed the first time we used the nickname that comes with his job. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1666.2600000000002s)]
*  The drugs are. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1672.3400000000001s)]
*  It's actually a title that I don't like. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1674.5s)]
*  Because I think it connotes this old war on drug focus to the work that we do. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1677.14s)]
*  It portrays that we are clinging to kind of failed policies and failed practices in the past. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1682.3400000000001s)]
*  Are you saying that the way we have waged the war on drugs for more than 40 years has been [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1688.1000000000001s)]
*  all wrong? It has been all wrong. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1692.98s)]
*  Blunt Force didn't knock out the drug epidemic. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1696.34s)]
*  Twenty-one million Americans are addicted to drugs or alcohol, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1699.54s)]
*  and half of all federal inmates are in for drug crimes. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1703.7s)]
*  We can't arrest and incarcerate addiction out of people. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1708.34s)]
*  Not only do I think it's really inhumane, but it's ineffective, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1711.3s)]
*  and it costs us billions upon billions of dollars to keep doing this. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1714.98s)]
*  So what have we learned? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1719.38s)]
*  We've learned addiction is a brain disease. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1720.42s)]
*  This is not a moral failing. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1722.58s)]
*  This is not about bad people who are choosing to continue to use drugs because they lack willpower. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1724.1799999999998s)]
*  We don't expect people with cancer just to stop having cancer. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1731.1399999999999s)]
*  Aren't they doing it to themselves? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1735.22s)]
*  Isn't a heroin addict making that choice? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1736.74s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1739.3s)]
*  The hallmark of addiction is that it changes your brain chemistry. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1740.6599999999999s)]
*  It actually affects that part of your brain that's responsible for judgment. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1744.82s)]
*  That is the essence of Michael Botticelli's approach. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1749.7s)]
*  Attic should be patients, not prisoners. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1753.14s)]
*  He did it in Massachusetts as director of substance abuse services. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1756.02s)]
*  There, his initiatives included a high school for teens in recovery [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1760.66s)]
*  and expanding drug courts like this one in Washington, D.C., [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1765.3s)]
*  where offenders can choose treatment over jail and the charges can be dropped. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1769.78s)]
*  You know that there are people watching this interview and they're saying to themselves, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1774.9s)]
*  oh great, he wants to open the jails and let the drug addicts out. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1778.82s)]
*  I think we have to base our policy on scientific understanding, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1783.38s)]
*  you know, and we've had really great models and evaluated models [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1786.42s)]
*  to show that we can simultaneously divert people away from our criminal justice system [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1790.1s)]
*  without an increase in crime and it actually reduces crime. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1794.74s)]
*  Botticelli pursues reform with the passion of the converted [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1798.58s)]
*  because he himself is recovering from addiction. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1803.0600000000002s)]
*  Back in 1988, he was a university administrator whose car slammed into a truck. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1807.94s)]
*  Botticelli was drunk. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1814.42s)]
*  In truth, he'd been drunk for years. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1816.1000000000001s)]
*  Did you love drinking? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1818.98s)]
*  I would say that I probably had an unhealthy love affair with drinking. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1821.78s)]
*  You know, I grew up as this kind of insecure kid, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1825.78s)]
*  you know, kind of making my way and, you know, drinking took all of that away, you know, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1829.78s)]
*  and people drink and do drugs for a reason because it makes them feel good, you know, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1835.46s)]
*  until it doesn't anymore. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1839.38s)]
*  Is it true that after the accident you woke up handcuffed to a gurney? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1841.14s)]
*  I did. I did and, you know, you think to yourself, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1844.98s)]
*  how did I get to this point, you know, in my life? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1848.5s)]
*  That point included imminent eviction from his apartment because the booze [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1852.3400000000001s)]
*  had washed away all the money. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1857.14s)]
*  A very wise judge said to me, Michael, you have two options. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1860.3400000000001s)]
*  You can either get care for your drinking problem [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1863.6200000000001s)]
*  or we can continue with criminal proceedings. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1867.3000000000002s)]
*  It was at that point that you walked into this church [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1869.6200000000001s)]
*  and went to the 12-step meeting down in the basement. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1872.18s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1875.0600000000002s)]
*  What was that first meeting like? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1876.1000000000001s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1877.46s)]
*  It's hard for me to talk about this and not from a sense of sadness, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1884.02s)]
*  from a sense of tremendous gratitude. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1887.3s)]
*  This was the first time that I raised my hand and said that I was an alcoholic [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1891.7s)]
*  and that I had a problem. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1896.5s)]
*  And what the miraculous thing about that movement is, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1897.46s)]
*  is that people rally around you in ways, you know, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1901.22s)]
*  addiction is such an isolating incident in your life. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1904.02s)]
*  You feel alone. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1906.82s)]
*  And, you know, when you admit and when you come into a fellowship like this [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1908.5s)]
*  and people just surround you and say, we will help you, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1913.7s)]
*  that you're not alone, that we've been through it before [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1917.7s)]
*  and you will get through it, just gives you such great hope. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1920.98s)]

*  Today, he oversees a $26 billion budget across 16 government agencies. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1930.1799999999998s)]
*  Just over half of the money goes to drug enforcement. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1936.5800000000002s)]
*  What do you say to those who argue, and there are many, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1939.94s)]
*  that if you lock down the southern border, you solve the drug problem? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1942.5s)]
*  I think it's overly simplistic to say that any one single strategy is going to [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1947.06s)]
*  really change the focus and change that trajectory of drug use. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1951.94s)]
*  For example, he says the heroin crisis was created here at home. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1956.02s)]
*  We know one of the drivers of heroin has been the misuse of pain medication. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1960.8200000000002s)]
*  If we're going to deal with heroin and heroin use in the United States, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1965.54s)]
*  we really have to focus on reducing the magnitude of the prescription drug use issue. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1968.98s)]
*  Many pain drugs are opioids, like heroin, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1973.78s)]
*  and the number of opioid prescriptions has risen from 76 million in 1991 to 207 million today. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1977.38s)]
*  We have a medical community that gets little training on pain, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1986.66s)]
*  gets little training on addiction, and quite honestly has been promoting, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1991.06s)]
*  and continues to promote, the overprescribing of these pain medications. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=1997.7s)]
*  Some are born addicted. We met Botticelli at Massachusetts General, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2003.54s)]
*  where Dr. Leslie Kirzner weans infants off of opioids. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2008.42s)]
*  Just going to give him this little bit of morphine right in his cheek. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2012.98s)]
*  In the last decade, the number of expectant mothers on opioids has increased five-fold. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2017.06s)]
*  If they don't get the treatment, they could have a seizure, and that's what we really worry about. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2023.78s)]
*  But how does a person who is addicted to prescription pain medication find themselves on heroin? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2028.6599999999999s)]
*  Prescription drugs and heroin act in very similar ways on the brain, and, you know, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2035.1399999999999s)]
*  unfortunately heroin, because of its widespread availability, is a lot cheaper on the streets [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2039.46s)]
*  of Boston and many places around this country. Heroin is cheaper than prescription pain killers. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2044.74s)]
*  It is. A bag of heroin could be as cheap as five, ten dollars. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2049.94s)]
*  More than 120 Americans die of drug overdoses each day. That is more than car wrecks or gun violence. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2054.02s)]
*  To save lives, Botticelli started an experiment in 2010 with the Quincy, Massachusetts police. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2062.26s)]
*  Lieutenant Patrick Glenn is head of narcotics. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2069.62s)]
*  When someone dies of an overdose, the community becomes very, very small. Everyone knows each [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2072.42s)]
*  other, even in a large city as ours. Just recently, in the past four to six months, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2076.82s)]
*  some of our officers have lost children. In a city of about 100,000 people, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2082.42s)]
*  did I just understand you to say that some of your officers have lost children to drug overdoses? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2086.1s)]
*  Yes. How many? Two did. Two of them lost sons. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2091.7000000000003s)]
*  In what period of time? Within the last six months. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2095.54s)]
*  Botticelli helped arm every Quincy officer with naloxone, a nasal spray antidote for overdose. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2098.58s)]
*  Lieutenant Glenn saw it work on an unconscious addict. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2106.02s)]
*  Within about 45 seconds to a minute, they started to move around, their eyes flooded, and they [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2109.7799999999997s)]
*  began to sit up and speak. Must have looked like a miracle. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2115.06s)]
*  It's surreal. And they got to the victim in time, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2117.7799999999997s)]
*  due to a controversial innovation called the Good Samaritan Law. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2122.58s)]
*  One of the changes that came under Botticelli's administration was that someone involved in drugs, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2127.46s)]
*  if there was an overdose, they could call 911 and they would not be arrested for having drugs on [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2136.7400000000002s)]
*  the premises. Correct. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2144.6600000000003s)]
*  What difference did that make? That opened the floodgates of people [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2146.5s)]
*  calling 911. Today, 32 states have a similar 911 law, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2149.7s)]
*  and naloxone is carried by more than 800 police departments. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2154.74s)]
*  In Massachusetts, Botticelli helped make treating addiction routine health care, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2159.94s)]
*  so patients can get their opioid treatments now in a doctor's office. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2165.22s)]
*  Things have been going really well for you. We'll figure out the path you can [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2169.94s)]
*  walk down to stay in recovery. And today, the Affordable Care Act requires [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2173.22s)]
*  most insurance companies to cover addiction treatment. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2177.94s)]
*  I often say that substance use is one of the last diseases where we let people reach their most acute [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2181.54s)]
*  phase of this disorder before we offer them intervention. You've heard the phrase hitting [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2188.66s)]
*  bottom. Well, we don't say that with any other disorder. So the medical community has a key [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2193.7000000000003s)]
*  role to play in terms of doing a better job of identifying people in the early stages of their [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2199.38s)]
*  disease, in doing a better job at treating people who have this disorder. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2205.22s)]
*  Notice that word, disorder. Botticelli prefers it to addiction. He wants to lift the stigma [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2210.4199999999996s)]
*  by changing the language, as he did this past October in a rally on the National Mall. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2216.8199999999997s)]
*  We must choose to come out in the light and be treated with dignity and respect. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2222.8199999999997s)]
*  So let's stop whispering about this disease. Botticelli sees a model for the change in [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2229.06s)]
*  attitude in the gay rights movement, which he has also lived. He's been with his husband, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2234.42s)]
*  David Wells, more than 20 years. At what point were you comfortable talking about being a gay man? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2240.66s)]
*  Before I was comfortable talking about being an alcoholic. The alcoholism was harder. You know, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2251.54s)]
*  even kind of feeling that moment of hesitation about saying that I'm in recovery and not about [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2257.46s)]
*  being a gay man shows to me that we still have more work to do to really de-stigmatize addiction. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2262.9s)]
*  But it's addiction to legal drugs, alcohol and tobacco, that kill the most Americans, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2268.42s)]
*  over half a million a year. Botticelli does not believe in adding another drug to that cocktail [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2274.26s)]
*  with the legalization of marijuana. You're not a fan. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2280.98s)]
*  I'm not a fan. What we've seen, quite honestly, is a dramatic decrease in the perception of risk [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2284.5s)]
*  among youth around occasional marijuana use. And they are getting the message that because it's [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2290.9s)]
*  legal that there's no harm associated with it. So we know that about one in nine people who use [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2296.42s)]
*  marijuana become addicted to marijuana. It's been associated with poor academic performance [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2303.94s)]
*  and exacerbating mental health conditions linked to lower IQ. Botticelli worries the [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2310.1s)]
*  marijuana industry is quickly adapting Big Tobacco's playbook. In the 1990s, tobacco companies [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2316.34s)]
*  appealed to kids with flavored cigarettes and Joe Camel. Today, the nearly three billion dollar [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2323.3s)]
*  marijuana industry promotes sweetened edibles and Buddy, a mascot for legalization. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2329.46s)]
*  You are never going to be able to talk all the states out of the tax revenue that will come [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2337.1400000000003s)]
*  from a burgeoning marijuana industry. It will just be too seductive. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2342.9s)]
*  You know, that's quite honestly my fear is that states are going to become dependent on the revenue. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2347.46s)]
*  It becomes a codependency. It becomes an addiction to, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2353.7000000000003s)]
*  unfortunately, tax revenue that's often based on bad public health policy. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2356.7400000000002s)]
*  As for his own recovery, Botticelli says it gets easier, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2362.34s)]
*  though he still attends those 12-step meetings that he called miraculous. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2366.26s)]
*  There are people watching this interview right now who are addicted to drugs, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2373.2200000000003s)]
*  are alcoholics, and they cannot stop. And to them, you say what? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2380.5s)]
*  That there's help, that there's hope, that there is treatment available. If I, in some small way, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2388.5800000000004s)]
*  can help people to see that there is this huge, incredible life on the other side of addiction, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2394.26s)]
*  you know, I will feel accomplished in my job. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvXkdoQ4Es&t=2401.22s)]
