# Crisis at Pearl Harbor; Dr. Kuznetzov; Indian Relay | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc)
*  It's an incredible feat. Pearl Harbor's Red Hill bulk fuel storage facility. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=0.0s)]
*  Seven miles of tunnels cut through volcanic rock built to hold 250 million [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=11.52s)]
*  gallons of fuel. So this is one of the tanks. Oh my gosh. And to give you kind [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=18.12s)]
*  of a reference point, the Statue of Liberty, not the base, but the statue [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=23.76s)]
*  itself can fit in here with enough room. Tonight you'll hear what happened at [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=27.04s)]
*  this once secret site and how it's affected thousands of military families. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=33.4s)]
*  What is the scope of the mine threat in Ukraine? Unrecognizable in modern times. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=42.6s)]
*  We watched a young D-miner probing for a tripwire that could detonate a mine [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=49.32s)]
*  nearby. Russia has sown Ukraine with millions of mines. She threaded the grass, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=55.76s)]
*  feeling for the slightest resistance. The day before, another D-miner had been killed. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=62.68s)]
*  Welcome to the 2023 Championship of Champions. In Indian relay, as many as six thoroughbred [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=69.92s)]
*  racehorses are brought to a start line drawn in the dirt. The horses are bareback, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=79.84s)]
*  no saddles or stirrups. Their riders wear no protective gear. At the sound of a horn, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=84.8s)]
*  they leap aboard and tear down the track. These horses are able to run like you wouldn't believe, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=90.96s)]
*  but the hard part comes from jumping off. I'm Leslie Stahl. I'm Bill Whittaker. I'm [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=99.88s)]
*  Anderson Cooper. I'm Sharon Alfonsi. I'm John Wertheim. I'm Cecilia Vega. I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  Those stories tonight on 60 Minutes. The U.S. military takes pride in protecting [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=118.68s)]
*  its own. That's why military families we met in Hawaii told us they feel so betrayed. Two years [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=132.4s)]
*  ago, there was a fuel spill close to the drinking water system at the Pearl Harbor [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=139.0s)]
*  Basin, Hawaii. As we first reported in April, Navy leadership assured thousands of military [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=143.32s)]
*  families that the tap water was safe. But nearly two weeks after the spill, parents learned the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=149.16s)]
*  truth. The water they drank or used to bathe their kids contained jet fuel. Tonight, you'll hear from [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=154.84s)]
*  some of the families who say the jet fuel tainted water made them sick. But first, we'll go to where [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=161.88s)]
*  the water crisis at Pearl Harbor began. From the air, the historic naval base is easy to spot. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=167.64s)]
*  Eight miles from Honolulu, sparkling blue waters host battle gray ships and memorials to those [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=176.04s)]
*  killed by Japan's surprise attack in 1941. What you can't see is the once secret storage site [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  that provided fuel for the Pacific fleet and its planes for 80 years. It doesn't look like much [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=190.6s)]
*  from the outside. Wait till you get inside. Vice Admiral John Wade led us through the Red Hill [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=197.24s)]
*  bulk fuel storage facility. Seven miles of tunnels cut through volcanic rock built to hold 250 million [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=202.84s)]
*  gallons of fuel. So this is one of the tanks. Oh my gosh. That black hole is a steel lined fuel tank [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=211.16s)]
*  so deep it's hard to see the bottom 20 stories below. To just show you how enormous this is, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  this tank holds 12.5 million gallons. And to give you kind of a reference point, the Statue of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=225.88s)]
*  Liberty, not the base, but the statue itself can fit in here with enough room. And this is just one [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=231.24s)]
*  of the 20 tanks hidden here. This is the Arizona, writhing in death agony. When the Japanese bombed [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=239.0s)]
*  Pearl Harbor, construction was already underway to protect the Navy's fuel reserves from an aerial [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=246.2s)]
*  attack. The decision was made to embark on a hurling task to build a bulk storage fuel facility [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=252.28s)]
*  inside a mountain in secrecy. And how long did that take to do? There's a little less than three [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=260.2s)]
*  years. At its peak there are about 4,000 men working here. Watch your head. We're going to go this way. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=266.52s)]
*  But this testament to American resolve became a monumental liability after this. That's jet [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=272.84s)]
*  fuel spraying from a cracked pipe. The video was recorded by a worker inside Red Hill on November [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=280.44s)]
*  20th of 2021. The fuel, 20,000 gallons of it, was trapped in a plastic pipe. The weight caused the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=287.0s)]
*  pipe to sag. This trolley hit it and jet fuel spewed for 21 hours, close to the well that supplied [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=295.72s)]
*  drinking water for 93,000 people on and around the base at Pearl Harbor. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=303.8s)]
*  According to Navy investigators, the workers who responded didn't have the right tools to contain [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  the spill. They also assumed there was no danger to the drinking water. They were wrong. At least [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  5,000 gallons of jet fuel drained into the tunnel floor and into the Navy water system. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=321.48s)]
*  The next day the Navy issued a press release about the incident and told the 8,400 families [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=327.48s)]
*  living in military housing the water remains safe to drink, even though the Navy had not tested the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  water yet. A week later, residents began to notice a problem. When did you get the sense that there [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=341.16s)]
*  was something wrong with the water? My husband came into the kitchen and washed his hands and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  said, gosh, the water smells like I just did an oil change. Like the water smells weird. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=353.56s)]
*  Brittany Traeger lived on base about two and a half miles from Red Hill with her daughter [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=359.24s)]
*  and husband who was a Navy chief petty officer. Traeger says she began to feel sick a week after [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=364.2s)]
*  the spill. I had a cough. My tonsils were very swollen. I remember a very distinct moment where [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=370.6s)]
*  I was walking to the car and I had vertigo so bad that I had to hold on to the car. The smell was [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=377.32s)]
*  that overwhelming. In an email to residents nine days after the spill, the commanding officer of [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=383.16s)]
*  the base reassured residents, there are no immediate indications that the water is not safe. My staff [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=390.04s)]
*  and I are drinking the water. Did you stop using water? Did you stop taking baths? So I did, my [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  daughter did. Just because you had a bad feeling, not because anybody told you to? Correct. They [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=404.04s)]
*  gave us an email address that we could send an email to if we wanted to have our water tested. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=408.92s)]
*  So I emailed those people who then emailed me a phone number that I should call and I called [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=414.92s)]
*  that phone number for days and it was just busy. They were overwhelmed and inundated with reports. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=419.64000000000004s)]
*  Ten days after the spill, there were more than 200 reports from six neighborhoods across the base [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=427.56s)]
*  of strong fuel odor coming from kitchen and bathroom faucets, but the Navy said its initial [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=433.88s)]
*  tests did not detect fuel. It defied logic, you know, even though there was a leak and even though [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=440.12s)]
*  our water smelled like jet fuel and even though there was sheen on it, they continued to say [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=447.15999999999997s)]
*  the tests are coming back negative. After 12 days and four statements assuring residents the water [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=451.8s)]
*  was not contaminated with fuel, the Navy reversed course. On December 2, 2021, it announced more [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=459.08s)]
*  comprehensive tests conducted by the Navy had detected jet fuel in the water. Three weeks after [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=467.8s)]
*  the spill, tests from Hawaii's Department of Health revealed jet fuel levels 350 times higher [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=475.08s)]
*  than what the state considers safe. Rochelle Dietz lives on base with her husband, a Navy chief [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=482.28s)]
*  petty officer, and their two children. Jet fuel's not something that you would even think could happen [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=488.68s)]
*  to be in your water. How were people reacting to the news? I was so sick to my stomach from that [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=495.08s)]
*  news that I actually threw up when I hurt. Because why? Because my kids had just been poisoned. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=501.0s)]
*  Within a month, the Navy set up medical tents for residents. Some complained of stomach problems, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=508.68s)]
*  severe fatigue, and coughing. The military moved more than 4,000 families to hotels. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=514.36s)]
*  Small studies of military personnel suggest jet fuel exposure can lead to neurological and breathing [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=521.32s)]
*  problems, but the long-term impact of ingesting jet fuel is unknown because it's so unlikely to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=528.12s)]
*  ever happen. Rochelle Dietz told us days after the spill, her daughter's tonsils became inflamed and [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=535.32s)]
*  her son started suffering from chronic headaches. I can hear people saying, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=542.04s)]
*  tonsils, headaches, kids get that stuff. How do you know it's related? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=547.3199999999999s)]
*  Because they never had it before November of 2021. It wasn't an issue. It's unclear how many got sick, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=551.88s)]
*  but of 2,000 people who responded to a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=560.28s)]
*  more than 850 sought medical care. The water system was flushed over three months [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=566.2s)]
*  and bottled water brought in. Brittany Traeger said her four-year-old now suffers respiratory [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=573.48s)]
*  problems which require hour-long treatments at least two times a day. That includes a [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=579.96s)]
*  nebulizer and this vibrating vest to clear her lungs. Tell me about your daughter's health. 13 days [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=585.6400000000001s)]
*  after the contamination, after our water smelled like jet fuel, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=593.08s)]
*  my daughter woke up in the hotel with a cough and it pretty much never went away. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=600.84s)]
*  Three months passed before Pearl Harbor's drinking water was deemed safe again. The [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=610.0400000000001s)]
*  Navy's own investigation into the spill described quote cascading failures and revealed poor [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=615.24s)]
*  training, supervision and ineffective leadership at Red Hill that fell unacceptably short of Navy [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=621.24s)]
*  standards. For the last 10 years, Hawaiians have raised concerns about the threat from smaller [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=627.96s)]
*  leaks at Red Hill. The primary water supply for the city of Honolulu is 100 feet below the Navy [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=634.28s)]
*  complex. In March of 2022, the Secretary of Defense ordered Red Hill permanently closed. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=641.72s)]
*  Vice Admiral John Wade was brought in to get the 104 million gallons of fuel out of the tanks [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=648.68s)]
*  and move it safely to sites around the Pacific. We've got to defuel. That's the imminent threat. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=654.52s)]
*  There's ongoing and will be continued long-term environmental remediation to restore the aquifer, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=659.9599999999999s)]
*  the land and surrounding area and then there's also a medical component for those that have been [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=667.56s)]
*  impacted. You view now this thing that was a lifeline for the fleet, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=672.52s)]
*  is a threat. That's right. That's right. In six months, Wade's team in Hawaii successfully [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=677.0s)]
*  removed almost all of the fuel, but it took two years before the Navy issued disciplinary letters [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=682.84s)]
*  to 14 officers involved in the spill response, including five admirals. Was anyone fired because [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=688.92s)]
*  of this? At the time that the accountability came through, we had officers that had already [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=696.52s)]
*  retired and so they had already separated from service. Meredith Berger is an Assistant [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=703.08s)]
*  Secretary of the Navy. We met her at the Pentagon in November. She told us the Navy has been [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=709.88s)]
*  accountable. We're talking about 20,000 gallons of fuel leak, 90,000 people had their water [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=715.72s)]
*  contaminated. It looks like people retired or were reassigned and no one was fired. How is that [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=722.44s)]
*  accountability? It's accountability within the system that we have established and we have [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=729.88s)]
*  heard that this was too long and that maybe it didn't go far enough. 2,000 military families [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=737.4s)]
*  agree the Navy didn't go far enough and are suing the government. The Tragers and Dietzes have [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=744.36s)]
*  joined the lawsuit, alleging they were harmed by negligence at Red Hill. Are you angry that it [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=750.36s)]
*  happened or are you angry at what happened after? It's a little bit of anger but it's also this [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=756.36s)]
*  feeling of betrayal. What do you mean betrayal? So my husband has been in for almost 18 years. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=762.52s)]
*  We have moved our family cross country, cross oceans. We gave so much of our life to the Navy [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=768.76s)]
*  for them to ignore warnings and then we were directly and blatantly lied to about it. Navy leaders [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=774.84s)]
*  have apologized for the spill but have not said that the contaminated water is the cause of the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=783.24s)]

*  believes they have health issues related to the tainted water. What happens in 5 or 10 or 15 years? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=795.48s)]
*  Will those services still be available to these families? So that is part of why I'm [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=802.76s)]

*  of government that failed. They contaminated our water. They lied to us. They did not protect us [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=884.1999999999999s)]
*  and they did not intervene and accountability looks like a lifelong care plan for me, my family, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=889.96s)]
*  and the people affected and that will restore my faith in my nation. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=896.44s)]

*  No matter how Russia's war in Ukraine ends, Dr. Yuri Kuznetsov will be battling Vladimir Putin's [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=920.36s)]
*  madness for years. As we first reported this past spring, Kuznetsov is a Ukrainian surgeon and a [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=927.24s)]
*  national hero who stayed by his patients as they were attacked. Now, heroism is a virtue that must [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=934.44s)]
*  endure. His city was liberated but Dr. Kuznetsov sees victims every week or so, civilians who step [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=942.6s)]
*  on one of the millions of Russian landmines across about one-third of Ukraine. There's a massive [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=950.2s)]
*  effort to clear the mines but that will take a generation or more. Until then, there will be Dr. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=957.72s)]
*  Kuznetsov with healing hands and eyes that have seen too much. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=964.0400000000001s)]

*  all he'd become in 52 years was laid down in service to his home. We didn't imagine until the [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=982.12s)]
*  end that Russia would attack our country, Dr. Kuznetsov told us. When you're sitting in a basement [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=991.48s)]
*  at night and a plane is flying over you, it was impossible to predict whether you would wake up [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=999.4000000000001s)]
*  to see another day. In 2022, the basement became Dr. Kuznetsov's operating room. That's him dressed [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1005.8000000000001s)]
*  in white. The wounded were endless, a close friend's wife he could not save and this man who was shot [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1014.44s)]
*  and lived. Did you save more patients than you lost? We saved significantly more people, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1023.1600000000001s)]
*  definitely. Many of your colleagues evacuated and you did not. I wonder why you stayed. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1031.16s)]
*  When you have patients and you're the only doctor or the only person who can treat them, I [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1040.76s)]
*  I didn't understand how you could leave. He could not leave [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1047.0800000000002s)]
*  Izium. His city of 40,000 was occupied for six months. The Russians laid landmines here as they [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1053.8s)]
*  ran from Ukraine's counterattack. Putin's unprovoked war on an innocent people destroyed 80 percent of [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1061.8s)]
*  Izium and killed 1,000, leaving apartment buildings cleaved in two [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1069.96s)]
*  and this school built in 1882 a hollow corpse. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1080.44s)]
*  The people of Izium clothe themselves in liberation and yet they are not entirely free. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1087.08s)]
*  Demining teams are still fighting Russia here. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1094.68s)]
*  Izium, 20 miles from the front, is one of the worst areas for mines and unexploded ordinance. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1105.88s)]
*  Throughout Ukraine, more than 1,000 civilians had been wounded by mines. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1113.48s)]
*  Lydia Borova, a 70-year-old widow, was picking mushrooms in a forest. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1118.68s)]
*  I turned by the tree and then there was an explosion, she said. I looked down at myself [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1126.68s)]
*  and I was bleeding, my arm was injured, my leg was injured, I was losing strength. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1133.0s)]
*  Her right foot and ankle were ripped away. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1141.16s)]
*  Kuznetsov said, first of all, the most difficult thing is to persuade a patient that their leg [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1144.04s)]
*  needs to be amputated. It's very difficult to explain to them that the leg is no good, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1151.3999999999999s)]
*  no good to use. He told us a prosthetic is ultimately easier to live with. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1158.28s)]
*  Dr. Kuznetsov saved me, she told us. I didn't realize how much blood I lost, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1165.72s)]
*  I don't know how I managed to survive. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1171.3200000000002s)]
*  Ihor Bogoraz was with his wife in their garden. They found 12 mines, but there were 13. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1176.6000000000001s)]
*  I decided to mow the weeds, he told us, and I did. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1186.6000000000001s)]
*  I decided to mow the weeds, he told us, and one mine was under my foot. I stepped on it [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1192.3600000000001s)]
*  and it exploded instantly. And that's it. No leg. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1199.0800000000002s)]
*  Serhey Nikolaev was walking in leaves from the autumn while uncovering grapevines for the spring. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1206.76s)]
*  If it had been green, he told us, I would have noticed it. But it was brown, I didn't see it, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1213.72s)]
*  it blended in with the leaves. I stepped on it and I knew right away. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1222.2s)]
*  Kuznetsov said, the majority are those who stepped on petal mines or anti-personnel mines. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1230.76s)]
*  The person who invented them was an evil genius, because they only weigh two ounces, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1238.76s)]
*  but what they can do when triggered is terrifying. Petal mines, five inches long, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1246.52s)]
*  flutter from aircraft by the thousands, like flower petals. Eleven pounds of pressure will set them off. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1253.96s)]
*  Vasil Solianyk found them on his roof and in his garden. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1261.24s)]
*  There's 18 here, he told us, but in all there were over 50. He showed us his video. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1268.04s)]
*  That's a petal mine right there. They are so common that we were told the story of a 70-year-old [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1276.44s)]
*  woman who gathered them in a basket and took them to a police station. Solianyk told us, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1284.44s)]
*  there's some left in the bushes over here, so don't walk around there. He dialed 101 [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1292.28s)]
*  and emergency services sent deminers Ivan Shepalev and Ihor Okcharuk. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1300.76s)]
*  We encounter every type of munition, Okcharuk told us. Anti-infantry and anti-tank mines, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1307.24s)]
*  mortars, artillery shells, rockets, it's all here. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1314.1999999999998s)]
*  At Solianyk's home, a sweep revealed an unexploded cluster bomb. Those are tricky. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1321.6399999999999s)]
*  So they blew it in place. Ivan Shepalev told us, as the Russians fled, they also left booby traps. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1337.8799999999999s)]
*  We have seen cases, unfortunately, where explosives were found in civilian homes. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1350.28s)]
*  Okcharuk said, my team also had to work on removing our dead Ukrainian soldiers, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1356.76s)]
*  whose bodies had been mined. In 2022, Ihor Okcharuk's kneecap was shattered [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1367.72s)]
*  when a fellow deminer stepped on a mine and lost his foot. Shepalev told us, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1375.8s)]
*  we know every explosive we remove means that someone's life is saved. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1381.64s)]
*  A few weeks after our visit, a Russian missile wrecked the fire station where they're based. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1390.2s)]
*  Some were injured, but not Shepalev or Okcharuk. What is the scope of the mine threat in Ukraine? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1397.88s)]
*  I think the scope is unrecognizable in modern times. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1406.92s)]
*  Pete Smith heads demining here for the Halo Trust, a charity founded in 1988 to demine war zones. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1411.08s)]
*  Smith was 33 years in the British Army and awarded by Queen Elizabeth for disarming an IRA time bomb [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1419.56s)]
*  in a train station. Today, he says, Ukraine is the most heavily mined country. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1427.56s)]
*  In some areas, the minefields are three or four mines deep. In areas, maybe a dozen mines deep. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1434.84s)]
*  But that's just the first line of defense. Then several kilometers behind that, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1441.56s)]
*  there are other layers of minefields as well. Smith took us to a farm sewn with Russian [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1445.72s)]
*  anti-tank mines. You have to step carefully. Right there, in the center, is a mine packed [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1453.6399999999999s)]
*  with 17 pounds of high explosive. With three weeks of training behind her, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1460.2s)]
*  Yulia Yaroshuk was probing for any tripwire that would detonate a mine near her. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1467.72s)]
*  She threaded the grass, feeling for the slightest resistance. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1477.0800000000002s)]
*  Only the day before, a Halo deminer was killed and two were wounded in another part of Ukraine. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1485.08s)]
*  Doing this by hand, with that wand, it seems to me that you have an awfully big field to cover. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1493.8s)]
*  She said, well, of course, it'll be a very long process. As far as I know, it'll take many, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1502.84s)]
*  many years. Each day of war means years of demining. Why do you do this work? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1510.1200000000001s)]
*  I didn't have to do it. I wanted to do it. This is my contribution to victory. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1519.24s)]
*  Will Ukraine ever be without mines? I think what I have seen in my time in Ukraine is the innovation, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1526.28s)]
*  the patriotism, and just the sheer will of the people that I'm confident that they will be able [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1533.0s)]
*  to remove the last mine from Ukraine. Does this war make any sense to you? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1538.3600000000001s)]
*  Not to a single person here or anywhere, Serhe Nikolaev said, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1552.6000000000001s)]
*  What kind of mind, what kind of moron or idiot do you have to be [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1558.28s)]
*  to even wish something like this on your enemies? You can't. Even now, someone could drop a fork or [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1569.16s)]
*  a spoon and it makes a loud noise, and in your soul you feel pain and bitterness and fear. It's a real [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1579.16s)]
*  horror. My sister-in-law was ripped apart by a mine in front of her children, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1588.04s)]
*  in front of their eyes. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1603.24s)]
*  Of all of Vladimir Putin's war crimes in Ukraine, one was the bombing of Izium's central hospital. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1608.04s)]
*  Kuznetsov told us, After this part of the hospital was damaged, a lot of medical services [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1618.6s)]
*  simply became unavailable. Here we had both intensive care and three operating rooms. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1625.32s)]
*  When Yuri Kuznetsov was 14 years old, his grandmother died in his arms. He told us [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1634.76s)]
*  that's why he became a doctor, and we suspect that's why he stayed through the bombardment [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1641.88s)]
*  and occupation and the battle of the mines. When a town loses its hospital, it doesn't just lose the [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1648.7600000000002s)]
*  medical care, it loses hope. The best praise for me was when a woman told me in April 2022 that [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1657.72s)]
*  when we heard the hospital was still open, we realized that our town had hope it could withstand, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1667.96s)]
*  survive and have a future. The future of Ukraine will demand devotion and heroic patience. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1675.48s)]
*  On this day, Yulia Yarochuk slowly teased out one Russian mine, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1685.8799999999999s)]
*  with millions more receding from its edge. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1692.92s)]
*  The horse has played a central role in the history and mythology of many Native American tribes. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1711.24s)]
*  The Shoshone, Crow, Blackfeet, Sioux and other tribes first saw horses when Spaniards brought [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1718.6s)]
*  them to this continent 500 years ago, and have used them in hunting and in battle ever since. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1725.32s)]
*  Collectively, these tribes call themselves the Horse Nations. As we first reported this spring, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1732.04s)]
*  men and women from those tribes also use horses in a sport that fans have dubbed America's original [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1738.6s)]
*  extreme sport. The tribes call it Indian Relay. Its roots date back centuries, and it's one of [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1745.48s)]
*  the most exciting, dangerous and inspiring things you're ever likely to see. Welcome to the 2023 [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1752.84s)]
*  Championship of Champions. We start at the start. In Indian Relay, as many as six thoroughbred race [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1762.52s)]
*  horses are brought to a start line drawn in the dirt. The horses are bareback, no saddles or [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1769.72s)]
*  stirrups. Their riders wear no protective gear. At the sound of a horn, they leap aboard and tear down [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1775.88s)]
*  the track. To actually get on a horse bareback and run as fast as you can around is easy. That's easy? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1784.44s)]
*  Yeah. Ken Realbird is a sort of senior statesman of Indian Relay, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1797.88s)]
*  and announces races all over the American West. These horses are able to run like you wouldn't believe, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1804.68s)]
*  but the hard part comes from jumping off. Wait, what? After the riders race one lap around the [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1816.7600000000002s)]
*  half-mile track, they all speed into a sort of equine pit row where teammates are waiting with [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1825.0s)]
*  fresh horses for what's known as the exchange. So he has to come in, gear down enough, and then [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1835.24s)]
*  angle that horse in. He gets off and takes one, two, three steps, and he's on to the back of that horse. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1845.08s)]
*  Yeah! Boom, there he goes. Here comes Carlson. Ken Realbird makes that flying leap from one [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1855.4s)]
*  horse to another sound simple. It is not. It's more like a dangerous chaotic dance with riders [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1865.48s)]
*  and horses from six teams all trying to do the same thing at the same time in the same space. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1874.28s)]
*  You have what they call the setup man. Their job primarily is to have that horse in the proper [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1881.08s)]
*  position as the rider comes in. Simultaneously, you have a guy who's usually a nimble guy on his feet, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1889.72s)]
*  and he's got to catch that horse coming in at 15 miles an hour. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1899.48s)]
*  That horse, he really doesn't care about your feelings. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1903.4s)]
*  A third member of the pit crew is holding a third horse because the riders must do another leap [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1912.2s)]
*  for another lap. It's exciting, but it's dangerous to have a horse that's not in the same position [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1918.6000000000001s)]
*  It's exciting, but it's dangerous too, isn't it? Yeah. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1930.52s)]
*  A lot of injuries. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1937.72s)]
*  Almost every heat will have some of the guys getting run over. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1941.56s)]
*  Can you imagine the front line of Kansas City chiefs all combined in one and just run over you? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1948.04s)]
*  That's what it's going to feel like because that horse is a thousand pounds. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1955.8799999999999s)]
*  Injuries to both horses and humans are part of the sport. The team that best avoids collisions [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1963.32s)]
*  and wins that third lap on a third horse can be forgiven for showing off at the finish. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1969.56s)]
*  Ken Realbird says the roots of modern Indian relay are in the horse stealing raids that [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1978.84s)]
*  tribes once staged against white settlers and each other. These young men of the different nations [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1984.68s)]
*  would travel when it was middle of the night. They would come and take the prized horse and [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1991.72s)]
*  hightail it back to their home country. They exchanged horses as they were running because [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=1997.5600000000002s)]
*  they were being pursued and so that's pretty much the origin of the Indian relay sport that we know [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2003.72s)]
*  today. Races in the organized sport were first conducted in the early 1900s. When it first started [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2011.64s)]
*  out majority of these races were happening more in within their own communities, native communities [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2019.24s)]
*  on the reservations. I've seen some races. Calvin Ghost Bear is a member of the Sioux tribe. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2024.5200000000002s)]
*  Seven heats, eight heats. And president of an organization called the Horse Nations Indian [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2030.44s)]
*  Relay Council. What we do with Horse Nations is we basically took a lot of the races that were [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2035.56s)]
*  within the tribal nations, brought them out into the mainstream. Now we're bringing it on to a bigger stage. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2045.24s)]
*  Last summer's Indian relay circuit crisscrossed the west and climaxed in Casper, Wyoming with a [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2055.4s)]
*  three-day championship event that celebrated tribal culture and song [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2061.64s)]
*  and drum and dance and offered more than $100,000 in prize money thanks to sponsorship from a casino [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2068.6s)]
*  owned by the northern Arapaho tribe. It included a women's division. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2078.2799999999997s)]
*  It's two laps and two horses rather than the three and three in men's races. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2084.68s)]
*  But the athleticism and danger are every bit as evident. Now there's no quitting these kids. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2094.6s)]
*  There's also a kids Indian relay. Takes a great tumble. With riders as young as six racing on ponies, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2101.8799999999997s)]
*  climbing on and falling off. He's going to be all right. Those are the guys that grow up to be the [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2109.56s)]
*  great riders, the great setup men because they're all horsemen and it's like that in every reservation. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2116.6s)]
*  On the Blackfeet reservation in Montana we met Irvin Carlson and his son Chas who have been [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2126.2s)]
*  competing in Indian relay for years. Chas is one of the most seasoned riders on the summer circuit. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2132.28s)]
*  For relay making you good in the sport is this practice, practice, practice [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2141.5600000000004s)]
*  and years of experience. Another team we followed through the summer circuit is led by 23-year-old [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2146.84s)]
*  Tuesday Washakie from the Shoshone tribe in Wyoming. Her younger sister Zia is the rider [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2158.84s)]
*  for their women's team. Both feel a close connection to their horses. If you're having a bad day [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2165.6400000000003s)]
*  and it's just not going your way you can go out and you can catch your horse and ride him and things [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2173.56s)]
*  things will just seem to be better. I think that's just how it is. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2181.4s)]
*  Mason Redwing feels the same bond and obligation to care for his horses. It's really something [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2186.44s)]
*  special because we're all here for one purpose and it's the horse. Just setting up over here. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2192.52s)]
*  Mason hails from the Crow Creek Sioux reservation in South Dakota. When I was younger I didn't know [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2197.4s)]
*  why I used to feel such anger and animosity towards my own people. I didn't want to be [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2204.04s)]
*  Native American and the horse helped me you know reconnect with my culture and my family. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2208.6s)]
*  And be proud of who I am and proud of where I'm from. Why were you feeling you didn't like being [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2215.56s)]
*  a Native American? Growing up where I'm from on the reservation you see a lot of things that make [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2220.92s)]
*  you not proud. Like what? To be where I'm from. Alcoholism, drug addiction, drug abuse, suicide. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2225.8s)]
*  Suicide rates on the reservation are four or five times the national average. My own father was [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2234.76s)]
*  succumbed to alcoholism so it really hit home. You said the horse saved your life? Yep, yes sir. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2240.8399999999997s)]
*  Essentially. You think it does that for a lot of young Native American kids? I think so. There's [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2247.7999999999997s)]
*  a lot of kids out there that are just that are just looking for for that doorway. There's little [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2252.8399999999997s)]
*  glamour in Indian relay and lots of hard work. Every team is self-funded and nearly everyone has [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2259.56s)]
*  a day job to help pay the bills but the sport is on the rise. Prize money is increasing and [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2266.36s)]
*  67 teams competed in last summer's championships. The quality of horses is rising too. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2273.2400000000002s)]
*  Teams go to major racetracks like Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby, to buy sprinters [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2284.44s)]
*  well suited to Indian relay. Kentucky, that would be the ultimate demonstration race before [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2290.52s)]
*  the derby. That would be that would be my goal. Lots of thrills and hopefully no spills today. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2299.08s)]
*  Each team competed in one heat each day of the championships. Their cumulative time from the [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2309.0s)]
*  first two days determined whether they made the final championship heat on Sunday. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2315.48s)]
*  Is the race usually won or lost in the exchange? Yeah. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2322.44s)]
*  It's like a relay team in track and field. But in Indian relay exchanges involve six riders, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2329.96s)]
*  18 horses, 18 other humans and a cloud of dust. From what I've seen it's like chaos. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2337.48s)]
*  Tuesday Washakie's women's team made the championship heat in Casper [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2350.04s)]
*  and her sister Zia had a clean exchange in that race. They finished a close second. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2356.36s)]
*  I don't know you get demoralized or does it make make you more determined? It makes me more [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2362.6s)]
*  determined. I'd be out here mad as hell but I shouldn't be. Winning it all is going to be the [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2366.52s)]
*  time of 12. The first place women's relay team came from the Colville reservation in Washington [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2371.96s)]
*  State with rider Talia Time-and-Twa. Is this your first championship? No I actually won the first [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2377.88s)]
*  one in Walla Walla. All right. Yeah when I was 13. And how old are you now? 17. 17? Yeah. Wow. Are [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2384.2s)]
*  you going to do it again next year? Yeah I'm going to do it as long as I can. I love this game. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2391.72s)]
*  The day before we had watched Talia win a heat with her arms raised in a pose of triumph and [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2397.7999999999997s)]
*  strength. It is how we connect to the warriors of the past. The warriors of 200 years ago. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2404.52s)]
*  It's that same bloodline of that warrior that is cursing through their blood. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2413.16s)]
*  Mason Redwing. Over three days of heats [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2418.68s)]
*  we watched Mason Redwing and his team go from dirt pounding frustration when an exchange went wrong [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2424.44s)]
*  to exultation as another went right. Good good good. Because we're always searching for that [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2432.92s)]
*  perfect run. They didn't quite find it in the finals. It's for the championship of the wall. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2439.8s)]
*  The team that did was the one we'd first met months earlier on the Blackfeet reservation. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2447.2400000000002s)]
*  Irvin Carlson and his son Chaz. So we've been following you like all summer. Like this is the [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2454.44s)]
*  culmination of everything you've done all year. So does this give you bragging rights for a year or what? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2459.88s)]
*  As a tribal elder sang a traditional praise song in honor of their victory and organizers presented [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2469.0s)]
*  them with a check for twenty thousand dollars. We noticed a group of kids at the rail on their [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2475.4s)]
*  ponies watching intently. What the horse done for me I know the horse can do that for everyone a [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2483.88s)]
*  thousand times over and and I'm a firm believer in it. I know for a fact it can it can bring [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2489.56s)]
*  our young men and our young women back. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2497.08s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2506.12s)]
*  So when you look out there and you see all that green what do you think? I see [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2522.52s)]
*  money leaving America. Fear and sanity. You're noticing [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2526.28s)]
*  miss and disinformation on your own social media. This is the world we're taking in and [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2530.12s)]
*  we can make impacts and try to improve it. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2534.28s)]
*  Is this a battle of rich versus poor? In part it is. Black versus white? In part it is. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2540.52s)]
*  If you're not willing to protect a place like this then what are you willing to protect? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2546.52s)]
*  Go for me go for three one two three. Go. Wow. I want a strong America. I want a proud America. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4onEtjGlEsc&t=2556.92s)]
