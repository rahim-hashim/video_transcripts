# Military Contract Price Gouging; Scams Targeting Seniors; Jeff Koons | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [May 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8)
*  A 60 minutes investigation is exposing price gouging at the Pentagon, and you would be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=0.0s)]
*  hard pressed to find a better example than this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=12.08s)]
*  This bill is an oil pressure switch that NASA used to buy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=16.56s)]
*  Well their oil switch with all of the cabling cost $328. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=21.2s)]
*  This oil switch, we paid over $10,000 for it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=28.0s)]
*  Elizabeth, sorry, need my passport number because the Ukraine trip is on. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=32.0s)]
*  Can you read that out to me? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=37.2s)]
*  That's my voice, but that's not me. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=38.88s)]
*  It's the digital result of a clever hacker and a cheap voice altering app. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  Did you think it was me? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=46.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=47.36s)]
*  This is one of the scams that are costing American citizens $10 billion a year. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=48.36s)]
*  And as you'll hear, people over 60 are the main target. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=54.36s)]
*  It's like a death in the family almost. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=57.8s)]
*  Well, she's worked so hard, you know, for my money. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=59.96s)]
*  I sure have. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=63.84s)]
*  I believe the first piece was... [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=67.16s)]
*  Jeff Koons is one of the most prominent and polarizing art stars in the world. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=68.8s)]
*  His creations may look simple, but they can take decades to make and often push the boundaries [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=73.2s)]
*  of technology and sometimes taste. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=78.08s)]
*  Books may scoff at times, but that's nothing new. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=81.68s)]
*  Jeff Koons has been controversial since he first started showing his art more than 40 [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  years ago. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=89.04s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=92.4s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=95.2s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=96.4s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=100.4s)]
*  Those stories and more tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=101.76s)]
*  With the U.S. supplying billions of dollars of munitions to Ukraine and growing tensions [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=112.68s)]
*  in the Taiwan Strait, some Pentagon generals are sounding alarms about the dwindling supply [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  of U.S. weapons at a time when the cost of replacing them is skyrocketing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  We wondered why the Pentagon is finding it hard to procure weapons it needs at a price [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=129.96s)]
*  taxpayers can afford. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=134.78s)]
*  A six-month investigation by 60 Minutes found it has less to do with foreign entanglements [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=137.0s)]
*  than domestic ones, what can only be described as price gouging by U.S. defense contractors. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=142.84s)]
*  The gouging that takes place is unconscionable. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=151.08s)]
*  It's unconscionable. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=157.68s)]
*  Perhaps no one understands the problem better than Shea Assad, now retired after four decades [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=159.28s)]
*  negotiating weapons deals. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=164.94s)]
*  In the 1990s, he was executive vice president and chief contract negotiator for defense [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=167.34s)]
*  giant Raytheon. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=172.94s)]
*  Then he switched sides. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=174.82s)]
*  Under presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, Assad rose to be the Defense [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=178.1s)]
*  Department's most senior and awarded contract negotiator. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=183.78s)]
*  The Pentagon, he told us, overpays for almost everything, for radar and missiles, helicopters, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=188.66s)]
*  planes, submarines, down to the nuts and bolts. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=196.94s)]
*  This bill is an oil pressure switch that NASA used to buy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=203.34s)]
*  Well, their oil switch, with all of the cabling, cost $328. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  This oil switch, we paid over $10,000 for it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=215.18s)]
*  So what accounts for that huge difference? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=219.14000000000001s)]
*  Gouging. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=222.34s)]
*  What else can account for it? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=223.34s)]
*  To Assad's former defense industry associates, he was the most hated man in the Pentagon [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=225.86s)]
*  for his dogged scrutiny of their pricing practices. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  No matter who they are, no matter what company it is, they need to be held accountable. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=235.28s)]
*  And right now, that accountability system is broken in the Department of Defense. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=242.12s)]
*  So does that affect our readiness? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=247.24s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=250.6s)]
*  You just can only buy so much because you only have so much money. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=252.08s)]
*  And that's why I say, is it really any different than not giving a Marine enough bullets to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=256.32s)]
*  put in this clip? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=261.12s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=262.68s)]
*  Assad points to the Patriot weapons system, a pillar of air defenses for the U.S., NATO, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=265.88s)]
*  Ukraine and Taiwan. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  In 2015, Assad ordered a review and Army negotiators discovered Lockheed Martin and its subcontractor [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=274.48s)]
*  Boeing were grossly overcharging the Pentagon and U.S. allies by hundreds of millions of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=281.96s)]
*  dollars for the Patriot's PAK-3 missiles. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=288.36s)]
*  In over a seven-year period, these companies just keep raking it in. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=292.04s)]
*  What level of profit are we talking about? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=297.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, if the average profitability that was negotiated in a firm fixed price contract [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  was typically between 12% and 15%, so a company can make 12%... [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=307.72s)]
*  That's a good profit. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=311.76s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=312.76s)]
*  But Shaye Assad told us Pentagon analysts found total profits approached 40%. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=313.76s)]
*  Based on what they actually made, we would have received an entire year's worth of missiles [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=320.88s)]
*  for free. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=327.84s)]
*  An entire year's worth of missiles. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=328.84s)]
*  We would have got them for free. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=331.04s)]
*  Boeing declined our request for comment. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=333.08s)]
*  Lockheed told us we negotiate with the government in good faith on all our programs. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=335.76s)]
*  But after the review, the Pentagon negotiated a new contract with the company, saving $550 [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=341.32s)]
*  million. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=348.08s)]
*  Well, that's how you become the most hated man in the Pentagon, when you say, no, no, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  no, we're actually going to pay attention to this. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=353.52s)]
*  Army negotiators also caught Assad's former employer, Raytheon, making what they called [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=356.24s)]
*  unacceptable profits from the Patriot system by dramatically exaggerating the cost and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=362.12s)]
*  hours it took to build the radar and ground equipment. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  You called Raytheon on the carpet? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=371.44s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=374.44s)]
*  Of course, I reported that information up the chain. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=375.8s)]
*  But then I went to the Inspector General. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=380.04s)]
*  And I also went to the Defense Criminal Investigative Service. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=382.8s)]
*  And I said, I want this looked into. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=387.96s)]
*  Raytheon told us it is working to equitably resolve the matter. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=391.2s)]
*  And in 2021, CEO Gregory Hayes informed investors the company would set aside $290 million for [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=395.72s)]
*  probable liability. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=404.04s)]
*  I will say this is an ongoing investigation by DOJ. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=405.92s)]
*  We think these were one-off events that occurred, should not have occurred, but they did. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=409.6s)]
*  One-offs? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  No, it's not one-off. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  And it's not one-off with a lot of companies. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  A Department of Defense study released last month found major contractors flush with tens [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=420.8s)]
*  of billions of Pentagon dollars to hand out to shareholders. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=426.92s)]
*  We have to have a financially healthy defense industrial base. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=432.16s)]
*  We all want that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=437.96000000000004s)]
*  But what we don't want to do is get taken advantage of and hoodwinked. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=440.24s)]
*  And the U.S. has nowhere else to go? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=444.76000000000005s)]
*  We have nowhere else to go. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=446.26000000000005s)]
*  For many of these weapons that are being sent over to Ukraine right now, there's only one [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=448.56s)]
*  supplier. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  And the companies know it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=455.20000000000005s)]
*  It wasn't always like this. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=457.02000000000004s)]
*  The roots of the problem can be traced to 1993, when the Pentagon, looking to cut costs, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=459.08s)]
*  urged defense companies to merge. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=465.24s)]
*  Fifty-one major contractors consolidated to five giants. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=467.91999999999996s)]
*  The landscape has totally changed. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  In the 80s, there was intense competition amongst a number of companies. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=475.56s)]
*  And so the government had choices. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=481.7s)]
*  They had leverage. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  We have limited leverage now. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=485.68s)]
*  The problem was compounded when the Pentagon, in another cost-saving move, cut 130,000 employees [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=487.9s)]
*  whose jobs were to negotiate and oversee defense contracts. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=494.97999999999996s)]
*  The watchdogs in the government. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=499.84s)]
*  The watchdogs, the negotiators, the engineers, the program managers, over 50% was removed. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=501.17999999999995s)]

*  These motivations and objectives are different than the Department of Defense's. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=570.16s)]
*  Retired Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan spent his career overseeing the purchase [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=576.12s)]
*  of some of the country's most critical weapons systems. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=581.52s)]
*  They are companies that have to survive, make profit. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=585.36s)]
*  The Department of Defense, on the other hand, wants the best weapons systems it can have [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=589.9s)]
*  as quickly as possible and as inexpensively as possible. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=594.76s)]
*  Those are opposite ends of the spectrum. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=599.32s)]
*  But in our system, there's nothing wrong with profit. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=600.9200000000001s)]
*  No, there isn't. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=603.72s)]

*  In 2012, he was tapped to take the reins of the troubled F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=616.0400000000001s)]
*  It was seven years behind schedule and $90 billion over the original estimate. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=622.74s)]
*  But Bogdan told us the biggest costs are yet to come for support and maintenance, which [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=628.46s)]
*  could end up costing taxpayers $1.3 trillion. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=634.3000000000001s)]
*  We won't be able to buy as many F-35s as we thought because it doesn't make a whole lot [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=639.5400000000001s)]
*  of sense to buy more airplanes when you can't afford the ones you have. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=644.02s)]
*  The Pentagon had ceded control of the program to Lockheed Martin. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=650.5400000000001s)]
*  The contractor is delivering the aircraft the Pentagon paid to design and build. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=655.06s)]

*  the proprietary information needed to fix and upgrade the plane. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=666.86s)]
*  So you spend billions and billions of dollars to get this plane built, and it doesn't actually [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=671.14s)]
*  belong to the Department of Defense? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=678.02s)]
*  The weapon system belongs to the Department, but the data underlying the design of the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=681.26s)]
*  airplane does not. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=686.5s)]
*  We can't maintain and sustain the planes without Lockheed's... [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=689.38s)]
*  Correct. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=695.66s)]
*  And that's because we didn't upfront either buy or negotiate getting the technical data [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=696.66s)]
*  we needed so that when a part breaks, the DOD can fix it themselves. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  When a part breaks, it's likely to come from a subcontractor like Transdine, which has [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=709.7s)]
*  seen its stock soar as it buys up companies the military depends on for spare parts. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=715.74s)]

*  Shaye Assad's review team found the government will pay the company $119 million for parts [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=728.34s)]
*  that should cost $28 million. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=736.44s)]
*  Could you sell to the DOD these parts at a lower price and still make a reasonable profit? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=739.62s)]
*  I don't believe that's the question for us. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=747.38s)]
*  Transdine told us it follows the law and charges market prices, but in 2006, Shaye Assad says [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=751.3s)]
*  Apache helicopters were unable to fly without a crucial valve. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=758.54s)]
*  Transdine had taken over the manufacturer and hiked the price of the valve by $747, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=764.22s)]
*  up almost 40 percent. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=770.74s)]
*  We said, look, we need these parts to go on aircraft that are in Iraq. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=773.34s)]
*  They simply said, we're not going to ship it until you cough up. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=778.52s)]
*  To the battlefield? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=782.7s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=783.7s)]
*  This was going to the battlefield. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=784.9s)]
*  By 2018, the valve would grow to cost almost $12,000. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=786.88s)]
*  A Pentagon report called it extortion. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=791.98s)]
*  In March, the Pentagon announced its largest budget ever, $842 billion. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=795.7800000000001s)]
*  Almost half will go to defense contractors. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=802.74s)]
*  While contract spending is going up, Pentagon oversight is going down through cuts and attrition. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=806.22s)]
*  We met with recently retired auditors Julie Smith and Mark Owen and contracting officer [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=813.2600000000001s)]
*  Catherine Forsman, who are part of the downsizing. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=818.82s)]
*  They told us with less oversight and Shaye Assad now gone, the Pentagon is losing the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=822.5400000000001s)]
*  battle to hold down prices. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=828.5400000000001s)]
*  So explain to me, why can't the Department of Defense just step up to Transdine and [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=831.3000000000001s)]
*  say no, we're not going to pay that? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=837.86s)]
*  Because we don't have another source for a lot of the spares that they provide right [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=840.94s)]
*  now. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=844.34s)]
*  They are the literally only game in town in order to make an aircraft fly. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=845.34s)]
*  So we're at their mercy. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=851.74s)]
*  Does that make sense to any of you? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=853.22s)]
*  It is very concerning to me. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=856.62s)]
*  Contractors see that they can do this. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=859.5s)]
*  They are the ones that hold the power. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=862.02s)]
*  So it's not really a true capitalistic market because one company is telling you what's [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=865.0600000000001s)]
*  going to happen. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=872.14s)]
*  So if it's not a capitalistic system, what is it? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=873.5s)]
*  It's a monopoly. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=875.94s)]
*  If you're happy with companies gouging you and just looking you right in the eye and [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=877.94s)]
*  say I'm going to keep gouging you because I know you don't have the guts to do anything [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=883.82s)]

*  You can hear Monahan on the phone with the scammer as she hands off the money. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1082.74s)]
*  She said to move your butt because they're on a deadline. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1087.18s)]
*  She says as soon as the courier left and the adrenaline left her body, she was filled with [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1091.26s)]
*  a sick feeling she'd been scammed. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1095.98s)]
*  It's just devastating. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1098.62s)]
*  What did they do to your mom? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1101.1s)]
*  Beyond the money, beyond taking $9,000 from her? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1102.98s)]
*  Well, it's your livelihood. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1105.94s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1108.02s)]
*  It just gets you like in your gut. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1109.02s)]
*  The Federal Trade Commission reports scams like these skyrocketed 70% during the pandemic [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1111.84s)]
*  when seniors, home alone, went online to shop or keep in touch with family. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1117.62s)]
*  How much money were you scammed out of? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1122.62s)]
*  $11,300. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1124.7s)]
*  $14,000. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1125.7s)]
*  $7,600. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1126.7s)]
*  Judy Attig and her husband Ron, a retired iron worker, were victims of the same grandparent [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1127.7s)]
*  scam as Susan Monahan. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1137.78s)]
*  That's the view from their doorbell camera as the same courier took off with $7,600 of [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1140.74s)]
*  their savings. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1146.6599999999999s)]
*  $7,600 hits hard. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1147.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, that was for our, you know, if we want to go on a trip or something. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1149.6599999999999s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1154.22s)]
*  I was a mess. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1155.22s)]
*  Steve Savage, a retired scientist, was scammed when he opened a fake email from the Geek [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1157.78s)]
*  Squad. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1163.1s)]
*  The email said that your bank account is being charged $399 for another year. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1164.1s)]
*  And I'm like, wait a minute, I don't remember it being anywhere close to that. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1172.1s)]
*  The customer's service number went to a scammer posing as a representative of the company. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1177.02s)]
*  Savage was duped out of $14,000. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1181.54s)]
*  Esther Maestrate was scammed too. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1186.1399999999999s)]
*  The retired nurse says an alarm sounded on her iPad with a message to call tech support. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1188.82s)]
*  She did. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1194.5s)]
*  He said that last night between 4 and 9 p.m., your bank account has been hacked. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1195.5s)]
*  And your heart probably stopped. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1201.4199999999998s)]
*  You know, I felt so nervous. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1202.82s)]
*  He said, I am going to transfer you to another guy who is a security at Chase Bank. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1205.34s)]
*  That fake bank employee told her hackers might be able to access her bank account and instructed [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1211.34s)]
*  her to immediately withdraw money and deposit it into a new account for safekeeping. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1216.46s)]
*  Maestrate did and lost $11,000. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1222.82s)]
*  And have you been able to recover any of your money? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1226.9s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1229.78s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1230.78s)]
*  I pulled the money out of the bank so I won't be reimbursed. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1231.78s)]
*  If your house gets broken into, you call the police. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1235.5s)]
*  If this happens... [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1238.26s)]
*  There's no one to call. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1240.26s)]
*  Scott Perello is a deputy district attorney who runs San Diego's Elder Justice Task Force [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1241.26s)]
*  and connected us to the victims you just heard from. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1247.54s)]
*  He says studies show only one in every 20 seniors who've been scammed report it. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1250.54s)]
*  Often, they're embarrassed. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1256.06s)]
*  Most people who have not experienced this think, well, these people must have dementia [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1258.1s)]
*  or Alzheimer's. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1263.02s)]
*  It's not the case. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1264.02s)]
*  Our victims are sharp as a tack. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1265.2199999999998s)]
*  We had a woman, 66 years old. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1266.78s)]
*  She came home. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1269.3s)]
*  She got a message on her computer from Microsoft. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1270.3s)]
*  And the message said that she had a virus on her computer. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1273.2199999999998s)]
*  And then that virus had somehow infected her financial accounts. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1276.82s)]
*  Within a matter of weeks, this victim had lost $800,000. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1281.9399999999998s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1287.46s)]
*  The scariest part of these scams is that these victims have no recourse. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1289.42s)]
*  They're left bewildered. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1294.54s)]
*  What typically happens? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1295.9s)]
*  The seniors that have the courage to report that this has happened are being told that [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1298.7s)]
*  I'm sorry, there's nothing we could do. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1303.82s)]
*  And that is the reality, that a local police detective in Kansas City doesn't have the [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1306.58s)]
*  reach to go investigate a case that's being operated from the Caribbean or from Nigeria [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1312.5s)]
*  or Ghana. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1318.62s)]
*  Investigators have also traced scams to Europe, Southeast Asia and Canada. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1319.62s)]
*  Under reporting. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1323.66s)]
*  To combat them, San Diego's Elder Justice Task Force has taken a new approach. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1325.38s)]
*  Investigators collect every local fraud case, then collaborate with federal authorities [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1330.1s)]
*  to connect them. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1334.9s)]
*  If we have a victim that lost $12,000 here in San Diego, there is without question dozens [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1336.06s)]
*  of other victims to the same scam and millions of dollars in losses. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1343.3s)]
*  And then once we identify that the scam is part of something much larger, then we can [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1347.42s)]
*  deliver that to our federal partners with the reach to go around the country because [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1352.42s)]
*  these are networks. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1357.38s)]
*  These are transnational organized criminal networks. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1359.3s)]
*  In 2021, Parello helped the FBI bring down a network of criminals who stole millions [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1362.92s)]
*  of dollars from elderly victims. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1368.8400000000001s)]
*  Remember those doorbell videos from the grandparents scam? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1371.8400000000001s)]
*  The courier, a 22-year-old Californian, was the starting point for the FBI's case. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1375.28s)]
*  She's serving time for her role. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1380.96s)]
*  But the FBI says the scam's ringleaders, two Bahamian nationals based in Florida, fled [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1382.8400000000001s)]
*  the country before they could be arrested. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1389.24s)]
*  If you don't know how a criminal thinks, then you really don't know how you can protect [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1392.44s)]
*  yourself online. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1396.3600000000001s)]
*  Rachel Toback is what's called an ethical hacker. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1397.3600000000001s)]
*  She studies how these criminals operate. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1400.6000000000001s)]
*  So ethical hackers, we step in and show you how it works. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1403.0s)]
*  Toback is the CEO of Social Proof Security, a data protection firm that advises Fortune [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1406.1200000000001s)]
*  500 companies, the military and private citizens on their vulnerabilities. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1411.8s)]
*  We hired her to show us how easy it is to use information found online to scam someone. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1417.04s)]
*  We asked her to target our unsuspecting colleague, Elizabeth. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1422.96s)]
*  Toback found Elizabeth's cell phone number on a business networking website. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1427.08s)]
*  As we set up for an interview, Toback called Elizabeth but used an AI-powered app to mimic [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1432.2s)]
*  my voice and ask for my passport number. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1438.48s)]
*  Oh, yes, yes, yes, I do have it. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1441.6399999999999s)]
*  Okay, ready? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1444.68s)]
*  It's me. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1445.68s)]
*  Toback played the AI-generated voice recording for us to reveal the scam. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1446.68s)]
*  Elizabeth, sorry, need my passport number because the Ukraine trip is on. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1451.68s)]
*  Can you read that out to me? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1455.1200000000001s)]
*  Does that sound familiar? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1457.1200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1459.72s)]
*  And I gave her... [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1461.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1462.2s)]
*  I have your passport number. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1463.2s)]
*  I'm sitting over there. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1464.2s)]
*  What did it say on your phone? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1465.2s)]
*  Sharon. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1467.2s)]
*  How did you do that? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1468.2s)]
*  So I used something called a spoofing tool to actually be able to call you as Sharon. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1470.3600000000001s)]
*  So I was hacked and I failed. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1475.68s)]
*  I failed hacking. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1477.48s)]
*  Everybody would get tricked with that. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1478.48s)]
*  Everybody would. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1481.0s)]
*  It says Sharon, why would I not answer this call? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1482.0s)]
*  Why would I not give that information? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1484.36s)]
*  Toback showed us how she took clips of me from television and put it into an app that [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1486.6399999999999s)]
*  cloned my voice. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1491.44s)]
*  It took about five minutes. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1492.44s)]
*  I am a public person. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1494.28s)]
*  My voice is out there. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1495.76s)]
*  Could a person who's not a public person like me be spoofed as easily? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1497.08s)]
*  Anybody can be spoofed. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1501.24s)]
*  And oftentimes attackers will go after people. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1502.44s)]
*  They don't even know who these people are. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1505.3200000000002s)]
*  But they just know this person has a relationship to this other person. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1506.8400000000001s)]
*  And they can impersonate that person enough just by changing the pitch and the modulation [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1511.04s)]
*  of their voice that I believe that's my nephew and I need to really wire that money. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1515.3200000000002s)]
*  Toback says hackers no longer need to infiltrate computers through a back door. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=1519.88s)]

*  I was quite nervous but I told him I was a fan and that I would enjoy very much to meet [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2061.96s)]
*  him and he said, can you come to New York this weekend on Saturday? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2066.36s)]
*  And I said yes. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2072.28s)]
*  He said, be in the lobby at 12 o'clock and I'll meet you then. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2073.28s)]
*  And he was spectacular. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2078.0800000000004s)]
*  It would never have occurred to me to just call Salvador Dali in his hotel room. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2079.4s)]
*  I had nothing to lose. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2084.04s)]
*  Koons and Dali spent the afternoon together and at the end of it he asked the world renowned [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2086.7200000000003s)]
*  artist to pose for this picture. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2091.4s)]
*  I remember he put his mustache up and he was telling me, you know, kid hurry up, I can't [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2093.88s)]
*  hold this pose all day. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2100.12s)]
*  But I left New York that evening feeling like I could do this. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2102.02s)]
*  After finishing school he hitchhiked to New York and started making art in his Lower East [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2107.6600000000003s)]
*  Side apartment, buying cheap plastic inflatables and putting them on mirrors. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2111.82s)]
*  Koons had grand ambitions but he needed cash to realize them. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2117.32s)]
*  So eventually I became licensed and registered to sell commodities and mutual funds. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2121.32s)]
*  And so, you know, that's what I started to do, to be able to make more money to make [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2127.32s)]
*  the works. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2131.1600000000003s)]
*  That's not a career move a lot of artists make. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2132.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, I did it only that I could make enough money to make my vacuum cleaner [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2135.1600000000003s)]
*  pieces. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2140.84s)]
*  The vacuum cleaners he's talking about were what first got him noticed in 1980. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2142.0s)]
*  He bought about 20 brand new vacuums and displayed them in cases with fluorescent lights. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2146.58s)]
*  It was part of a series called The New. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2152.18s)]
*  I was showing them for their newness that this was a brand new object. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2154.7s)]
*  It was never used. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2159.34s)]
*  You can see that it's clean, it's pristine, its lungs are pure. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2161.54s)]
*  And there's also some sensual aspects to it too. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2165.86s)]
*  Sensual aspects? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2170.02s)]
*  Sensual, I mean, you have the handle and you have the bag right there. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2171.02s)]
*  It could be looked at as masculine or you could look at it and say, oh, you know, the [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2174.82s)]
*  bag is the womb. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2179.06s)]
*  Art definitely is in the eye of the beholder. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2181.5800000000004s)]
*  What did you think of Jeff Koons as an artist when he first came on the scene? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2184.6600000000003s)]
*  I was interested in him and I also was kind of repulsed by him. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2188.98s)]
*  Robert Storr, former dean at the Yale School of Art, was a curator at the Museum of Modern [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2193.38s)]
*  Art in New York when it acquired some of Koons's vacuums in 1996. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2197.6400000000003s)]
*  I think some of the work is really unpleasant, but it doesn't mean it's not serious. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2202.5s)]
*  What's unpleasant about it? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2207.18s)]
*  The imagery is vulgar, okay? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2208.94s)]
*  Now vulgar means many things. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2210.94s)]
*  It means of the people rather than of the elites. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2213.1s)]
*  So it's taking an object which the New York elites might look at and think, oh, that's [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2215.86s)]
*  tacky, that's trashy, that's something you buy in a gift shop, and it's blowing it up [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2220.78s)]
*  and making it perfect and saying that this has value? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2227.18s)]
*  It has meaning, not necessarily value, but it has meaning. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2231.74s)]
*  What is the message of that? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2234.14s)]
*  The message is that it is there to be embraced, that it is not to be mocked, that one should [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2235.58s)]
*  not be smugly sure of one's own taste to the point of denying the possibility of other [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2240.2999999999997s)]
*  tastes. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2245.8599999999997s)]
*  And is he being honest about that? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2246.8599999999997s)]
*  I think he's being totally honest. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2248.2599999999998s)]
*  And I think that he has made all of that fair game in a way that we have not seen since [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2250.46s)]
*  Warhol. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2256.48s)]
*  Like Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons has a factory of sorts with an assembly line of painters [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2258.66s)]
*  meticulously following his instructions and dozens of digital assistants, sculptors and [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2263.74s)]
*  craftsmen all over the world helping make his complex pieces, which are often inspired [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2269.66s)]
*  by very simple things. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2275.02s)]
*  This is like a very modern grandmother's closet. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2277.02s)]
*  Turns out Koons was fascinated by his grandparents' porcelain figurines as a child and has collected [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2280.1s)]
*  hundreds of them. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2285.7s)]
*  Where did you find this? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2287.18s)]
*  I found it online. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2288.18s)]
*  He decided to make this $150 ballerina into a multimillion dollar eight foot tall marble [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2290.66s)]
*  sculpture, but it wound up taking him 12 years. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2296.3399999999997s)]
*  First he used a CAT scan machine to digitally map every detail of the figurine inside and [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2300.2999999999997s)]
*  out. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2305.14s)]
*  Then it took him five years and the help of MIT scientists to begin translating all those [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2306.3799999999997s)]
*  details into instructions for machines to carve the sculpture. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2311.1s)]
*  The actual carving took another seven years. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2316.76s)]
*  Now the work will really progress quickly. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2320.28s)]
*  We went with Koons to a workshop in Pennsylvania to check on the progress and found Ayame Aoyama [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2323.34s)]
*  and her team carefully polishing the ballerina by hand. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2329.5600000000004s)]
*  Do you have a sense of how many hours of work is done on a piece? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2332.76s)]
*  33,000 hours. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2337.88s)]
*  33,000 hours. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2338.88s)]
*  Hours for just the hand work. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2339.88s)]
*  It must be exhausting. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2341.84s)]
*  I mean the level of detail and monotony and difficulty of it is incredible. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2343.32s)]
*  Yeah, it is like a really unique job I would say. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2348.44s)]
*  That looks like a sort of a dental tool. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2352.7200000000003s)]
*  What is this? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2354.08s)]
*  Yeah, that nail polisher that ladies actually use. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2355.08s)]
*  You'll notice Jeff Koons isn't doing the sculpting or painting. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2360.76s)]
*  He comes up with the ideas and sets the standards, but his artisans do the labor, which has led [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2364.32s)]
*  to criticism, including from our own Morley Safer. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2369.26s)]
*  What do you say to the man? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2372.76s)]
*  Thirty years ago, Morley did a story critiquing contemporary art and likened Koons to a PT [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2374.0400000000004s)]
*  Barnaut selling to suckers. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2379.8s)]
*  He doesn't actually paint or sculpt. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2381.88s)]
*  He commissions craftsmen to do that, or he goes shopping for basketballs and vacuum cleaners. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2384.36s)]
*  Is that a legitimate criticism? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2390.84s)]
*  It's a legitimate criticism if you look at art in a way that you kind of want everything [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2392.5600000000004s)]
*  to be done by the artists themselves, but it becomes very limited what you can do within [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2399.3199999999997s)]
*  one life if you're being responsible for everything. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2405.6s)]
*  It's like the production of this program right now. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2410.12s)]
*  Anderson, if you had to be responsible for the lighting, if you had to be responsible [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2413.08s)]
*  for editing. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2417.6s)]
*  If I was responsible for the lighting, we wouldn't see you or myself. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2418.6s)]
*  But if you'd have to be responsible for everything, I mean, how many programs would you be able [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2422.5s)]
*  to create? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2428.0s)]
*  I've designed, worked on the systems so that the whole process at the end of the day, it's [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2429.0s)]
*  as if every mark was made by myself. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2435.28s)]
*  At 68, Koons has reached a level of commercial success few artists ever imagined. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2438.92s)]
*  He's helped design cars for BMW, an album cover for Lady Gaga, even a super yacht. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2445.2400000000002s)]
*  And later this year, he hopes to create a permanent art exhibit on the moon. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2452.6800000000003s)]
*  He's made 125 small stainless steel moon sculptures and mounted them on a lunar lander that'll [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2457.52s)]
*  hitch a ride aboard a SpaceX rocket. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2463.56s)]
*  Is there something about the atmosphere on the moon that would affect the lifespan of [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2466.6s)]
*  a work? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2470.16s)]
*  Yeah, almost everything. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2471.16s)]
*  You know, you have tremendous radiation. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2473.44s)]
*  You have the temperature change, at least 250 degrees difference from night to day. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2476.0s)]
*  One of the most inhospitable environments that you could imagine for a work of art. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2482.4s)]
*  The moon sculptures are for sale, of course, along with an NFT, or non-fungible token, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2489.1600000000003s)]
*  which serves as digital proof your artwork is actually up there. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2494.8s)]
*  You'll also get one of these larger moons to show off here on Earth. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2499.2000000000003s)]
*  He won't say how much it'll cost you, but with Jeff Koons, it's a safe bet the price [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2503.52s)]
*  tag will be out of this world. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2508.12s)]
*  Now, the last minute of 60 Minutes. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2512.4s)]
*  Thank you for watching our 55th season of 60 Minutes. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2523.32s)]
*  We've been on some amazing adventures this year, and 60 Minutes has interviewed some [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2527.32s)]
*  fascinating characters, among them presidents and princes, prime ministers, and controversial [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2531.64s)]
*  members of Congress. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2538.04s)]
*  We learned a bit about the nature of our pets and tried never to be predictable. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2539.74s)]
*  We have viewed nature's awes and wars' atrocities. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2544.9399999999996s)]
*  Along the way, we've been entertained by some musicians and performers. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2549.02s)]
*  We've explored evidence of miracles at pilgrimage sites and evidence of desperation at our borders. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMIVa15dv8&t=2553.4199999999996s)]
