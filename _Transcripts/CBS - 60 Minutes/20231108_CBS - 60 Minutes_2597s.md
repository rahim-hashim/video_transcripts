# John Eastman; Our Mistake Is Your Responsibility; Monkey Island | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8)
*  John Eastman says he's innocent and he told us if he was ever guilty of anything it was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=0.0s)]
*  giving bold legal advice to Donald Trump. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=12.56s)]
*  He was among the architects of President Trump's bid to stay in power. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=15.92s)]
*  One judge called Eastman's strategy a coup in search of a legal theory. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=20.6s)]
*  You said 2,500 convicts, the investigation found four. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=26.12s)]
*  You said 10,000 dead voters, the investigation found four. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=30.18s)]
*  It doesn't seem like you knew what you were talking about. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=34.3s)]
*  Last year nearly one million Americans like Stephen and Becky Sword received a letter [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=40.0s)]
*  from the Social Security Administration saying that due to a government miscalculation they [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=44.66s)]
*  owed Social Security money, a lot of money. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=49.82s)]
*  In their case $51,887. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=53.28s)]
*  The swords were asked to repay it within 30 days. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=57.72s)]
*  Are you scared? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=60.88s)]
*  He's thinking we're going to lose our house, you know, what are we going to do? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=62.96s)]
*  I mean we're very scared. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=65.6s)]
*  There are roughly 1,800 monkeys on Cayo Santiago. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=71.0s)]
*  They live in isolation in what is a natural laboratory. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=75.72s)]
*  Today scientists are studying how the stress of a devastating hurricane affected their [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  overall health and relationships and what that might teach us about ourselves since [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=88.04s)]
*  we share 94% of our DNA with them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=94.06s)]
*  I'm Leslie Stahl. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=100.84s)]
*  I'm Bill Whitaker. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=102.44s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=103.76s)]
*  I'm Sharon Alfonsi. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  I'm John Wertheim. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=106.48s)]
*  I'm Cecilia Vega. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=107.76s)]
*  I'm Scott Pelley. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  Those stories and in our last minute, an update on the war in the Middle East. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=110.88s)]
*  Tonight on 60 Minutes. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=116.08s)]
*  John Eastman says he's innocent and he told us if he was ever guilty of anything, it was [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=125.8s)]
*  giving bold legal advice to Donald Trump. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=131.36s)]
*  Eastman was a little-known law professor who found himself at the center of history among [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=135.48s)]
*  the architects of President Trump's bid to stay in power. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  One judge called Eastman's strategy a coup in search of a legal theory. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=145.12s)]
*  Today Eastman faces nine criminal counts in Georgia's election conspiracy case and we [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=151.0s)]
*  found he's still handing out bold legal advice, this time to himself. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=157.01999999999998s)]
*  During possible years in prison, he agreed to talk with us. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=163.04s)]
*  That was the first advice I got from my legal team when I put them together, is that we [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=167.64s)]
*  don't talk about anything and in normal times that's the right advice for lawyers to give [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=172.28s)]
*  their criminal defendant clients. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=177.84s)]
*  But I quickly determined that this fight was much more about the criminal law, the specific [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=180.48s)]
*  law and a public fight. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=186.14s)]
*  We did nothing wrong and it's important to counteract the false narratives on that because [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=188.08s)]
*  all of my actions were designed to investigate illegality in the election to see if they [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=195.16000000000003s)]
*  had an impact. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=199.36s)]
*  63-year-old John Eastman graduated from the University of Chicago Law School, clerked [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and was dean of Chapman University's law [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=206.60000000000002s)]
*  school in California. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=212.28s)]
*  He views the world from the far right and has said the political left is an existential [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=214.72s)]
*  threat. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=221.24s)]
*  We're no longer disagreeing about means to get to shared ends. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=222.24s)]
*  We've got wings of the two parties that disagree fundamentally on the ends and the purpose [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=227.76s)]
*  of our government. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=233.4s)]
*  Existential, you said? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=234.76s)]
*  Well I do think existential. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=236.36s)]
*  I think what we're seeing now in the criminalization of political opposition and the threat to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=238.2s)]
*  shutting down speech of opposing political views means that the people are no longer [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=244.32s)]
*  in charge of the direction of their government. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=249.84s)]
*  In November 2020, Eastman joined Rudy Giuliani's effort to persuade seven states to withhold [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=252.16s)]
*  certification of Joe Biden's victory. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=260.0s)]
*  There's a plethora of evidence that you can go through that will convince you that this [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=262.84s)]
*  election was stolen. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=268.21999999999997s)]
*  My name is John Eastman. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=269.48s)]
*  Westman testified on Zoom to lawmakers in Georgia. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=271.76s)]
*  He said state election officials hadn't followed the law and he leveled dubious claims of fraud, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  including votes by 2,500 felons and 10,000 dead people. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  Something is amiss here and that the legislature simply must investigate as you're doing with [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=289.54s)]
*  this hearing today. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  But not one state agreed to withhold certification of its vote. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=295.5s)]
*  50 Trump lawsuits were failing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=300.28s)]
*  By January, the deadline was at hand. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=303.2s)]
*  On January 6th, electoral votes from the states are counted before a joint session of Congress. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=307.11999999999995s)]
*  The Constitution appoints the Vice President to open all the certificates and the votes [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=313.82s)]
*  shall then be counted. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  But two days before the count, Eastman came to this Oval Office meeting with a radical [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  interpretation of those words. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=328.76s)]
*  Vice President Pence, he said, had the power to stop the count and return the votes to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=331.68s)]
*  the states for reconsideration. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  To delay, to let them finish their investigative work and make a determination on whether the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  illegality had affected the outcome of the election. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=345.2s)]
*  And if it didn't, to report back so that we could have some more certainty about the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=348.08s)]
*  validity of the Biden electors. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=352.68s)]
*  But if it did, then we wanted to make sure that the person who actually won the election [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=354.56s)]
*  was the one that was certified. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=358.76s)]
*  No vice president had ever exercised this authority. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=360.56s)]
*  No vice president had ever claimed to have the power to exercise this authority. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=364.04s)]
*  Greg Jacob was Vice President Pence's legal counsel. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  He was in the Oval Office hearing Eastman read between the lines of the Constitution. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=373.04s)]
*  So it really was him inventing something without any historical roots or any historical foundations [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=379.38s)]
*  and then desperately trying to find some hook in the constitutional text that neither history [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=387.62s)]
*  nor structure nor practice nor common sense supported. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=393.62s)]
*  Eastman disagreed with that and even predicted that the courts might not intervene. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=398.7s)]
*  If the courts stayed out of it, there is no other actor to decide that issue. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=404.94s)]
*  And I expressed to Professor Eastman at our meeting the next morning on January 5th that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=410.18s)]
*  if it's not the courts, it's effectively going to be decided in the streets. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=417.88s)]
*  Greg Jacob told us Vice President Pence never believed he had the power to do anything but [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=422.5s)]
*  open and read the certified votes. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=428.86s)]
*  The certificate of the electors for president. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=431.82s)]
*  Back in 2001, Pence was a freshman congressman when Vice President Al Gore read the votes [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=434.28s)]
*  that denied Gore the presidency in one of the closest elections of all time. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=441.47999999999996s)]
*  May God bless our new president and our new vice president and may God bless the United [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=447.4s)]
*  States of America. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=452.91999999999996s)]
*  Did you see at any point in this period the vice president reconsider that view or waver [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=455.2s)]
*  in that determination? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=461.52s)]
*  No. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=462.76s)]
*  The vice president never wavered. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=463.84s)]
*  It never made sense to him that the vice president would be empowered to decide issues like that [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=465.38s)]
*  by the framers. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  And he said, look, I know the rules that judges have to follow. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=472.59999999999997s)]
*  You would never allow a judge to preside over and decide an issue when they have the kind [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  of interest that I have in this case. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=482.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm on the ticket. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=484.36s)]
*  Obviously, I want us to win this election. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=485.36s)]
*  How could it possibly be proper for the vice president of the United States to decide such [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=488.7s)]
*  an important question in which he has a personal interest like that? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=494.26s)]
*  Were there other lawyers in the White House who agreed with Eastman or was he out there [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=499.65999999999997s)]
*  alone? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=503.98s)]
*  I was not aware of any lawyers who agreed with him. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=505.68s)]
*  But one person did agree. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=509.62s)]
*  And I hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=512.1s)]
*  On the day of the Eastman meeting, Mr. Trump raised expectations that Pence could flip [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=516.14s)]
*  the election. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=522.22s)]
*  Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=523.22s)]
*  In a press release the day before the count, Mr. Trump said, the vice president and I are [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=528.56s)]
*  in total agreement that the vice president has the power to act. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=534.46s)]
*  When you saw that statement, what did you think? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=539.42s)]
*  I was outraged because I knew it was categorically false. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=542.38s)]
*  I knew that the vice president had conveyed multiple times to the president what his position [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=547.6600000000001s)]
*  was. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=554.6600000000001s)]
*  And I knew that the statement was not accurate. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=556.5400000000001s)]
*  John Eastman. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=559.1s)]
*  On January 6th, John Eastman told the president's rally that Georgia voting machines were rigged. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=560.6s)]
*  You know the old way was to have a bunch of ballots sitting in a box under the floor and [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=568.78s)]
*  when you needed more you pulled them out in the dark of night. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=573.62s)]
*  They put those ballots in a secret folder in the machines. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=577.1800000000001s)]
*  That was false. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=581.22s)]
*  And so were claims Eastman made to the Georgia legislature, according to an investigation [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=583.14s)]
*  by Georgia's Republican Secretary of State, who himself had voted for Trump. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=588.94s)]
*  You said 2,500 convicts, the investigation found four. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=595.32s)]
*  You said 10,000 dead voters, the investigation found four. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=599.58s)]
*  It doesn't seem like you knew what you were talking about. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=604.24s)]
*  You've now mischaracterized my testimony and I'm not going to let you get away with that. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=606.9200000000001s)]
*  They were based on the expert analysis and it didn't say 2,500 felons voted. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=611.8000000000001s)]
*  It said as many as. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  It acknowledged the limitation of the data they had and the analysis that was conducted, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=616.88s)]
*  The secretary of state was simply a press conference. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=623.04s)]
*  I'd love to see the data and we will adjust the numbers as the complaint that was filed [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=627.04s)]
*  the next day said we would once we got the additional data. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=630.88s)]
*  Too late to adjust the numbers now. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=633.88s)]
*  You've already testified to the legislature and there's a big difference between as many [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=635.5999999999999s)]
*  as 2,500 in the actual number of four. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=639.8s)]
*  Well, we don't know the actual number is four because the secretary of state has declined [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=642.92s)]
*  to give us the information on which that analysis was based. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=646.76s)]
*  He wondered if Eastman believes there's so much evidence, why has no state reported fraud [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=650.68s)]
*  that would overturn its election result? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=657.0s)]
*  I think we are quickly turning into a country where there's the pro-government party or [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=660.0s)]
*  the uniparty, one might euphemistically call it, and folks that are concerned about the [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=668.04s)]
*  direction our country is going. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=673.8s)]
*  The MAGA movement, the Tea Party movement before that if you will. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=675.24s)]
*  The folks in those government offices tend to be on the one side of that dispute rather [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=679.56s)]
*  than the other. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=683.64s)]
*  And you say they're covering it up? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=684.72s)]
*  Well, certainly they're not investigating it to the level I think the evidence warrants. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=686.48s)]
*  Further investigation was pursued by Georgia prosecutors. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=691.8s)]
*  A grand jury indicted 19 defendants including the former president alleging a conspiracy [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=696.4s)]
*  to overturn the election, including false statements to persuade Georgia legislators [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=703.12s)]
*  to reject lawful electoral votes. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=709.96s)]
*  We know the dead people voted. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=713.36s)]
*  With only hours to go before the count at the Capitol, Eastman's dubious reading of [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=715.12s)]
*  the Constitution became an ultimatum. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=720.52s)]
*  And all we are demanding of Vice President Pence is this afternoon at one o'clock he [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=723.64s)]
*  let the legislatures of the state look into this so we get to the bottom of it and the [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=730.36s)]
*  American people know whether we have control of the direction of our government or not. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=735.76s)]
*  And anybody that is not willing to stand up to do it does not deserve to be in the office. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=741.16s)]
*  It is that simple. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=746.32s)]
*  Hours later after the president's speech rioters were stalking Mike Pence. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=750.44s)]
*  Read Mike Pence! Read Mike Pence! Read Mike Pence! [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=756.44s)]
*  Greg Jacob, the vice president's counsel, was in the Capitol as Pence was reading, not [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=760.8800000000001s)]
*  judging, the vote. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=767.0400000000001s)]
*  We started hearing boom, boom, boom and all of a sudden glass shattered. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=768.96s)]
*  The riot stopped the count. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=780.36s)]
*  In the moment, Jacob sent emails to John Eastman. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=782.72s)]
*  Thanks to your bull, we are now under siege. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=786.52s)]
*  He called Eastman a serpent in the ear of the president. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=790.72s)]
*  The violence caused the vote count to take longer than the rules allow. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=795.1800000000001s)]
*  So Eastman wrote back to Jacob with a plea. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=800.22s)]
*  Since the rules were broken already, why not break one more and send the votes back to [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=804.1800000000001s)]
*  the states? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=810.4s)]
*  The people who stormed the building believed that the vice president had authorities that [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=811.56s)]
*  he in fact did not have. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  And that was a motivating factor for them in storming the building. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=818.92s)]
*  And after you see all of that actually play out, the kind of practical implications that [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=823.3599999999999s)]
*  I had expressed to him on the 5th, if the courts don't decide this is going to be decided [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=828.56s)]
*  in the streets, well, the streets had come to us. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=834.0s)]
*  And he still wanted us to go ahead and push ahead with his theory. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=837.3199999999999s)]
*  Which told you what about John Eastman? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=841.54s)]
*  He was mostly concerned with the results and didn't really care how many laws had to be [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=844.4599999999999s)]
*  broken to get there. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=849.02s)]
*  Eastman was forced to retire as a professor at Chapman University. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=851.62s)]
*  He asked to get on the president's pardon list, but that didn't happen. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=855.9399999999999s)]
*  Today he's fighting disbarment in California and this past August he turned himself in [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=860.4599999999999s)]
*  in Georgia and has pleaded not guilty. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=867.5799999999999s)]
*  Who is the John Eastman that we see in the mugshot? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=870.94s)]
*  The John Eastman you see in that mugshot is one who remains astounded that we have so [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=875.1s)]
*  corrupted our criminal law that this has even brought. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=879.3800000000001s)]
*  I hope in the fullness of time we get our acts together and understand this is a bridge [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=882.96s)]
*  too far in our criminalization of the law and our criminalization of our political opposition. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=887.98s)]
*  Last year Democrats and Republicans passed an electoral count law. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=896.22s)]
*  It now clarifies the vice president's role is to read, not judge, the votes. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=901.1800000000001s)]
*  Each month about 71 million Americans, retirees, disabled workers and others, receive checks [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=915.9s)]
*  from Social Security. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=921.82s)]
*  But each year about a million people get something else in the mail, a bill. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=923.74s)]
*  They're told they owe the government money, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars, because [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=928.22s)]
*  the Social Security Administration miscalculated their benefits and paid them too much. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=932.98s)]
*  It can happen to anyone and it can take years, even decades, for these unexpected debts to [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=938.86s)]
*  suddenly come to light. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=944.24s)]
*  It often doesn't matter if it's not the recipient's fault, they still have to pay. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=946.1800000000001s)]
*  Few people realize it, but Social Security's mistakes are your responsibility. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=951.2s)]
*  Last year at Stephen and Becky Sword's home in Chicago, a letter arrived from the Social [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=958.5400000000001s)]
*  Security Administration. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=962.72s)]
*  When Becky Sword read it, she was stunned to discover that she and her husband owed [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=964.0s)]
*  Social Security $51,887 and were expected to repay it within 30 days. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=968.8000000000001s)]
*  That letter changed your life? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=976.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=978.72s)]
*  Are you scared? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=979.72s)]
*  He's thinking we're going to lose our house, you know, what are we going to do? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=981.24s)]
*  I mean, we're very scared. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=983.88s)]
*  When we spoke with Stephen and Becky Sword in August, Stephen was making $16 an hour [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=986.4s)]
*  as a security guard on the overnight shift at a condominium complex. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=991.44s)]
*  Becky was working days as an occupational therapy assistant in a nursing home. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=996.4s)]
*  They're 62 years old and have worked full-time most of their lives. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1001.36s)]
*  For several years now, Stephen's been dealing with the effects of a pancreatic disease that [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1006.36s)]
*  nearly killed him in 2016. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1011.08s)]
*  How long were you in the hospital for? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1014.08s)]
*  About 105 days. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1015.76s)]
*  It was hard because when I left the hospital, it took me about two months to learn to eat [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1017.52s)]
*  and walk again. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1021.52s)]
*  Stephen started receiving Social Security disability checks in 2017 as he recovered [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1023.52s)]
*  and returned to work. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1028.14s)]
*  The agency's rules are complicated, but Becky faxed Stephen's pay stubs to Social Security, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1030.1s)]
*  so the agency could monitor his earnings and eligibility. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1035.96s)]
*  She kept the fax receipts. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1039.56s)]
*  So I knew they were getting it, you know. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1041.3600000000001s)]
*  In return, Social Security sent the Swords letters like this one, saying it had increased [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1043.72s)]
*  Stephen's benefits to give him credit for his 2019 earnings. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1048.8400000000001s)]
*  Is the impression you got from that that they're examining the pay stubs and they're paying [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1053.4s)]
*  attention and adjusting? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1057.48s)]
*  Yeah, because they're increasing it. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1058.48s)]
*  But the letter the Swords got last year from Social Security said Stephen shouldn't have [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1060.68s)]
*  gotten any money at the time the agency gave him that increase. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1065.06s)]
*  Stephen and Becky owed more than $50,000, the agency said, because we did not stop his [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1069.46s)]
*  checks about three years sooner. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1074.74s)]
*  Has anyone in Social Security ever sort of apologized? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1077.62s)]
*  No, they take no blame at all. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1080.62s)]
*  They say it's our fault. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1082.74s)]
*  They're saying you should have known that... [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1084.36s)]
*  That I'm making too much money. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1086.7s)]
*  That Social Security was giving you too much money. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1088.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1090.34s)]
*  Even though Social Security didn't know that they were giving you too much money. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1091.34s)]
*  Which is strange because you're sending in all your pay stubs. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1093.78s)]
*  Someone has to file that. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1096.82s)]
*  And when we asked them, they said, well, they're not looking at that every month. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1098.46s)]
*  And then she even said, well, they're not even looking at it every year. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1102.6s)]
*  I would think yearly at least they would review it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1105.5s)]
*  I could see making a mistake after a few months, but not three years of a mistake. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1107.74s)]
*  And then they blamed it on COVID. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1112.18s)]
*  They blamed it on being understaffed. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1113.82s)]
*  And so to me, right there, it's saying it's their fault. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1116.26s)]
*  The Social Security administration told us its privacy rules prevent it from commenting [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1119.22s)]
*  on individual cases like the swords. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1123.54s)]
*  And no one from the agency would give us an on-camera interview. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1126.34s)]
*  But Kylolo Kijikazi, the acting commissioner of Social Security, gave this testimony before [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1130.5s)]
*  Congressional Committee late last month. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1135.76s)]
*  How many people are receiving overpayment notices in a year? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1138.64s)]
*  For FY2022, 1,028,389. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1143.46s)]
*  For FY2023, 986,912. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1149.74s)]
*  Seems like an awful lot. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1155.7s)]
*  Nobody knows this is happening to so many people. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1157.9s)]
*  This is not a story Social Security wants to publicize. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1160.6000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1164.1000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1165.1000000000001s)]
*  Terry Savage writes a nationally syndicated column on personal finance. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1166.1000000000001s)]
*  Lawrence Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University, created software to [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1170.22s)]
*  help people maximize their Social Security benefits. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1174.78s)]
*  Together, they've been trying to draw attention to what they call Social Security horror stories, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1177.82s)]
*  caused largely, they say, by the Social Security administration's own mistakes. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1183.5s)]
*  Their mantra, their rule is, our mistake is your mistake. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1188.38s)]
*  And you can appeal it or ask for a waiver. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1193.5s)]
*  The only reason they will waive this callback is if you are indigent, really, really poor. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1196.7s)]
*  The worst part of it is they have all the power because they say, if you don't pay us [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1204.02s)]
*  back, we're just going to cut your benefit check. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1210.46s)]
*  Imagine, people live on those checks and all of a sudden you get no check or a small amount. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1213.5s)]
*  If someone's been paid too much in Social Security benefits, why shouldn't they have [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1220.22s)]
*  to pay it back? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1224.54s)]
*  Because you relied on it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1226.12s)]
*  So you may have decided to retire early or to spend the money on your child's tuition. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1227.6999999999998s)]
*  Overpayments have existed for decades and caused people a lot of financial pain. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1234.12s)]
*  But fixing the problem has never been a high priority on Capitol Hill. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1238.9599999999998s)]
*  In 2015, Congress did approve a measure to reduce overpayments by giving Social Security [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1243.1599999999999s)]
*  more timely access to payroll data. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1248.6399999999999s)]
*  But eight years later, the agency still hasn't put the new system in place. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1251.36s)]
*  Aging technology and staff shortages have taken a toll on Social Security. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1256.56s)]
*  Last year, the agency's workforce hit a 25-year low as the number of people claiming benefits [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1261.6s)]
*  kept going up. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1267.1599999999999s)]
*  When we took a close look at Social Security's annual reports to Congress, we discovered [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1268.9599999999998s)]
*  something else has been going up as well. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1273.4799999999998s)]
*  The amount of money the agency has been clawing back from the checks of people with overpayments. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1276.06s)]
*  Gene Rodriguez, who's 73 years old, told us her retirement checks had been withheld for [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1282.28s)]
*  the past two years. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1288.04s)]
*  A former school cafeteria worker, she started receiving benefits in 2014. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1289.9199999999998s)]
*  But four years later, she and her husband Glenn were asked to come to the local Social [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1295.08s)]
*  Security office in Virginia Beach, Virginia to speak with the representative. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1299.6s)]
*  And he says, we have a small problem. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1304.6s)]
*  How much did he say they had overpaid you? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1306.6799999999998s)]
*  Seventy-two thousand dollars. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1310.36s)]
*  That doesn't sound like a small problem. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1312.4799999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1314.24s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1315.24s)]
*  We were both devastated. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1316.24s)]
*  What did they tell you happened? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1317.24s)]
*  Somewhere along the line, they made a combination of four other people in addition to my numbers. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1320.04s)]
*  So they were giving you benefits based not just on your salary, but on four other people's [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1327.1599999999999s)]
*  salary all combined. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1332.36s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1334.6399999999999s)]
*  Good question. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1336.0s)]
*  I don't know how they did it. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1337.0s)]
*  Did Social Security admit to you that this was their fault? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1339.8s)]
*  Yes, they did. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1342.3999999999999s)]
*  But the agency said the Rodriguez's had to pay the money back anyway because they could [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1344.24s)]
*  afford to do so. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1348.76s)]
*  Gene and Glenn own their home and Glenn gets a pension from the Navy. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1350.6399999999999s)]
*  If it was something I knew I did totally wrong, they had the right to come after me. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1355.44s)]
*  But I didn't know how they calculated it. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1360.96s)]
*  And then they waited four years to figure it out. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1364.1599999999999s)]
*  In a statement, the Social Security Administration told us our payment accuracy rates are high, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1368.8s)]
*  yet even small error rates add up to substantial improper payment amounts. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1373.72s)]
*  The agency said it's required by law to recover this money and added that overpayments are [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1378.76s)]
*  not necessarily the agency's fault. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1383.9199999999998s)]
*  They can happen when a beneficiary does not timely report work or other financial information. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1386.48s)]
*  There's no statute of limitations on how long Social Security can wait to collect an overpayment. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1393.2s)]
*  Two years ago, Roy Farmer of Grand Rapids, Michigan got a letter from Social Security [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1398.76s)]
*  asking him whether he'd forgotten to pay a debt he didn't know he had. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1403.16s)]
*  This is an alleged overpayment from 20 years ago? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1407.6s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1410.28s)]
*  When you were 11 or 12 years old? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1411.28s)]
*  Correct. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1413.44s)]
*  Roy Farmer grew up in rural Cadillac, Michigan in a family of six that struggled to make [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1414.44s)]
*  ends meet. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1419.48s)]
*  We ended up near homelessness a couple of times. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1420.84s)]
*  At one point, even living, you know, six of us in a camper trailer. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1423.04s)]
*  He was born with cerebral palsy. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1427.94s)]
*  I had leg braces. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1430.5800000000002s)]
*  I had to walk with a child-sized version of like an old person walker. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1432.38s)]
*  And you had surgeries, you had doctor's visits, you had it treated. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1436.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1440.66s)]
*  And so thankfully they were able to get me to a point where I can live a more or less [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1441.66s)]
*  normal life with some limitations. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1444.3200000000002s)]
*  He's 33 years old now and works full time. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1447.54s)]
*  But when he was a child, his mother received benefits on his behalf. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1450.3s)]
*  Social Security told him that when he was 11 years old, the agency determined he was [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1455.02s)]
*  no longer medically eligible for benefits and his mother received $4,902 too much. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1459.48s)]
*  His mother died a few years ago and the agency is insisting he pay back the money because [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1467.04s)]
*  it believes he can afford to do so. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1472.12s)]
*  Could you afford $4,902? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1475.0s)]
*  No, sir. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1476.94s)]
*  That much is about a sixth of my annual take home pay. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1479.06s)]
*  Like most of the people we spoke to, Roy Farmer couldn't find a lawyer to help him. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1483.02s)]
*  There's little financial incentive for attorneys to take on these cases. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1487.66s)]
*  It took Farmer nine months to get the documents in his Social Security file. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1492.16s)]
*  He was looking for the agency's evidence that he was no longer medically eligible for benefits [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1496.68s)]
*  when he was 11 years old. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1501.94s)]
*  But he says there was none. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1504.0s)]
*  And they told me, we probably had it at some point, but we don't have it now. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1506.6s)]
*  They admit there's no evidence you're at fault, but they're still coming after you for it. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1511.48s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1515.98s)]
*  People at Social Security have told us, look, this is a law. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1516.98s)]
*  This has to be changed through Congress or hands are tied. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1521.48s)]
*  It's not, Anderson, because the law says that if equity and good conscience demands that [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1524.08s)]
*  the clawback be waived, it should be waived. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1531.46s)]
*  Lawrence Kotlikoff, the economist who's written about overpayments, is talking about a specific [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1534.58s)]
*  part of the Social Security Act that says the agency should not recover an overpayment [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1539.38s)]
*  if doing so would be against equity and good conscience. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1544.68s)]
*  The problem, he says, is that Social Security interprets that phrase in a very narrow way. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1548.8200000000002s)]
*  So the agency itself, Social Security Administration, has a lot of discretion. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1554.8000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1557.88s)]
*  Oh, sure they do. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1558.88s)]
*  But financially, the long-term picture is not good. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1559.88s)]
*  And they've trained the staff. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1563.68s)]
*  Look, your job is to collect every penny you can, no matter what. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1565.24s)]
*  The Social Security Trust Fund for Retirement and Disability Benefits is expected to be [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1569.74s)]
*  depleted around 2035 because the benefits being paid out are greater than the payroll [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1574.22s)]
*  taxes coming in. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1580.1s)]

*  How similar to us are they in how they live? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1966.7s)]
*  They form really strong social relationships with their best friends and their family members. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=1970.14s)]

*  Yes. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2060.28s)]

*  So two days after the storm, the team came up with an idea. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2127.6s)]

*  Can he see any monkeys? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2141.7999999999997s)]
*  Are they alive? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2142.9199999999996s)]
*  What is the status of the vegetation? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2144.2s)]
*  Are there standing pools of water that they might be able to drink? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2146.76s)]
*  Angelina, who had decided to go up with the pilot, was horrified. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2150.76s)]
*  This is footage she shot from the helicopter. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2157.32s)]
*  I see this destruction, like 80 plus years of work completely flattened. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2160.0400000000004s)]
*  This is CAIO before the hurricane, with a dense canopy of trees and lush foliage. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2169.32s)]
*  This is after. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2177.04s)]
*  A green oasis turned brown. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2178.04s)]
*  Buried in dead branches, the island lost two-thirds of its vegetation. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2181.0s)]
*  Heartbroken by what she was seeing from the air, Angelina wanted a closer look. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2187.04s)]
*  But even on the ground, she didn't see any monkeys. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2192.76s)]
*  So then I get on the helicopter again. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2197.04s)]
*  Back up again. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2199.2400000000002s)]
*  And I need to look there again. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2200.2400000000002s)]
*  And that's when I see a social group running from the helicopter. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2203.08s)]
*  And it's like, oh, there's monkeys. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2207.52s)]
*  They're still CAIO. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2209.72s)]
*  I think I estimated, OK, that must be around like 300, 400 monkeys or so. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2212.48s)]
*  Out of 1,700? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2218.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2219.88s)]
*  But once the staff was able to return and do a complete census on the ground, they found, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2220.88s)]
*  to their utter astonishment, that most had lived. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2228.2799999999997s)]
*  They estimated just about 50 had died. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2233.8s)]
*  And you're thinking, how could they survive this? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2236.38s)]
*  How could they? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2239.4s)]
*  How could they survive this? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2240.78s)]
*  It's still a mystery. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2243.7400000000002s)]
*  What did the monkeys do to ride out the storm? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2245.4s)]
*  Where did they shelter from the wind? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2248.5s)]
*  And what did they eat? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2250.7000000000003s)]
*  So one of the big questions is, without being fed, how were they nourished? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2252.58s)]
*  Yeah, so although the hurricane did dramatically de-vegetate the island, one thing it also [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2259.46s)]
*  did was deposited a great amount of seaweed and algae onto the island. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2265.8199999999997s)]
*  And so one possibility is that the monkeys were eating more of this kind of vegetation. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2271.2999999999997s)]
*  Which they still seem to enjoy. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2276.7s)]
*  After the hurricane, the monkeys had to adjust to a new, far more hostile environment. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2279.7799999999997s)]
*  Their innate adaptability certainly helped. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2286.42s)]
*  So they bob up and down to try and stop themselves from falling forward. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2289.38s)]
*  Six years after the storm, the adjusting continues. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2293.82s)]
*  Attempts to replant the trees have been stymied because the monkeys, ever curious about anything [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2298.82s)]
*  new in their environment, uproot them before they have a chance to grow. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2304.62s)]
*  So now there's very little shade. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2310.18s)]
*  This used to be almost forested, right? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2313.78s)]
*  Lots of space and shade. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2316.38s)]
*  Now they're forced to sit in a few shaded areas, so they've been clumped by the changing [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2317.38s)]
*  distribution of shade. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2324.5s)]
*  So an interesting thing that we saw is that individuals became more social. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2326.5s)]
*  Not just more social. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2333.02s)]
*  The researchers have noticed that the monkeys are more tolerant of each other, which at [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2334.66s)]
*  first seemed counterintuitive. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2339.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm thinking of humans in a situation where there's fewer resources. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2342.38s)]
*  And I see in my mind's eye competition. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2347.78s)]
*  I see them saying, get off my property or whatever. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2350.2200000000003s)]
*  But you're saying that it was the opposite here. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2353.1000000000004s)]
*  Perhaps, but there's also famous examples of people pulling together. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2356.1400000000003s)]
*  So I think it can go both ways. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2360.7000000000003s)]
*  We're capable of great greed and competition and cruelty, but humans are also capable of [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2363.1400000000003s)]
*  great kindness and compassion and friendship and generosity. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2370.7s)]
*  And that kind of duality exists in rhesus macaque societies too. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2375.58s)]
*  And I think anyone you talk to here in Puerto Rico would bring up the fact that the people [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2380.58s)]
*  of Puerto Rico sort of gelled and increased their support of one another in the face of [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2385.8199999999997s)]
*  this event. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2389.7s)]
*  Beyond observing their social interactions, they were also able to track biological changes [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2391.54s)]
*  since they had access to blood tests done on the monkeys for 13 years. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2397.58s)]
*  So what we found is that individuals who had lived through the hurricane had immune systems [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2402.9399999999996s)]
*  that looked like they had aged an extra two years. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2408.4199999999996s)]
*  What is that in human years? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2411.9399999999996s)]
*  Is it six to eight human years? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2413.4199999999996s)]
*  They aged six to eight years? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2415.4599999999996s)]
*  They aged six to eight human years. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2418.54s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2420.5s)]
*  Through the trauma. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2422.8199999999997s)]
*  That was on average. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2423.9399999999996s)]
*  That's the work that we're trying to do right now is what makes some of these individuals [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2425.34s)]
*  more resilient to the hurricane, right? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2430.46s)]
*  Is the hypothesis that it has something to do with friendships? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2433.1400000000003s)]
*  We think that those individuals who are able to have stronger bonds, stronger friendships [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2437.38s)]
*  might have been protected from this really stressful event. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2443.1400000000003s)]
*  The hurricane opened all new avenues of their research with questions such as what predicts [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2448.26s)]
*  who survives a catastrophe like an earthquake or a hurricane and how quickly they recover. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2455.06s)]
*  So when you step back and look at your study in terms of climate related trauma or any [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2463.34s)]
*  kind of trauma, are you expecting to find answers for survivability in these situations [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2470.34s)]
*  for human beings? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2478.3s)]
*  Given the strong similarity between these primates, these monkeys and us, we know that [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2479.66s)]
*  a lot of the work that we're doing and the things that they might do to be more resilient [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2485.62s)]
*  to this might be translatable to humans, to us, and might provide ways for us to intervene [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2492.66s)]
*  and help buffer against the negative effects of these traumatic events. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2499.3799999999997s)]
*  The Last Minute of 60 Minutes is sponsored by UnitedHealthcare. There for what matters. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2509.66s)]
*  Now CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata from Israel. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2522.98s)]
*  This morning, Secretary of State Antony Blinken made a surprise visit to the West Bank where [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2528.3399999999997s)]

*  and that the overall death toll has now surpassed 9,700. The Israeli military claims it has [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2557.0s)]
*  surrounded Gaza City and troops are closing in. Hanging in the balance, the fate of more [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2563.24s)]
*  than 240 hostages taken by the terror group and those attacks that killed more than 1,400 people. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ_Ovz6ub8&t=2568.56s)]
