# North Korea and the new Cold War | 60 Minutes Full Episodes
**CBS - 60 Minutes:** [January 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w)
*  After years of threatening to burn the United States in a sea of fire, North Korea is on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=0.0s)]
*  the verge of having an intercontinental ballistic missile, an ICBM, capable of hitting the American [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=17.96s)]
*  homeland with a thermonuclear warhead. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=23.64s)]
*  The missile is called the Hwasong, which translates to Mars, the Roman god of war. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=26.8s)]
*  As you will hear tonight, North Korea's brash young dictator, Kim Jong-un, is not there [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=32.52s)]
*  yet and will need several more tests before he has a weapon he can count on. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=37.2s)]
*  Still, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs calls it the greatest threat facing the U.S. today. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=41.8s)]
*  Defense Secretary James Mattis went to the DMZ two days ago and vowed to stand with South [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=47.28s)]
*  Korea against the North. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=52.68s)]
*  Attacking that threat and helping to come up with defenses against it is the job of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=55.4s)]
*  the National Air and Space Intelligence Center, NAISC for short, located near Dayton, Ohio. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=59.6s)]
*  If you've never heard of NAISC, that's because television news cameras have never been inside [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=65.88s)]
*  its operations center. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=69.9s)]
*  Until now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  On any given day at NAISC, more than 100 photo interpreters, engineers, rocket scientists, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=75.12s)]
*  and intelligence analysts are pouring through reams of data collected every time North Korea [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=81.44s)]
*  launches a missile. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=85.24s)]
*  Last summer, says NAISC Commander Colonel Sean Larkin, the North Korean threat went [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  to a whole new level. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=91.94s)]
*  They demonstrated the ability that they could reach the continental United States. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  The lower 48. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=98.68s)]
*  There were two tests, one on July 4th and again on July 28th. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  Both were launched at a very high angle, so they did not go far out to sea. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  But once NAISC crunched the numbers, there was no doubt. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=109.16s)]
*  Had one of those missiles been fired on a standard trajectory, it could have reached [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=112.44s)]
*  California and beyond. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=116.52s)]
*  Math is our secret weapon. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=118.64s)]
*  So there's lots of things that go into an ICBM or other types of weapon systems that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=119.64s)]
*  simply, even if we don't have the pieces of the puzzle, we can do the math and figure [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=123.68s)]
*  out what's missing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=126.78s)]
*  Well, this is the actual code that we develop. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=127.78s)]
*  This is a computer simulation of North Korea's ICBM produced by Jeremy Sewell and his team [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=131.24s)]
*  of analysts. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=136.52s)]
*  So can you take me through what this would look like on a flight? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=137.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=141.8s)]
*  This is the god of war, North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  The first stage of the system is there to get it off the ground, get initial motion, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=147.84s)]
*  but then it will drop that stage. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  After the Hwasong-14's engines have centered into space, all that is left is the reentry [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=155.62s)]
*  vehicle. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=160.88s)]
*  A warhead would be inside as gravity pulls it back to Earth. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=161.88s)]
*  You're at the mercy of the atmosphere at that point. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=165.88s)]
*  You're slamming into it at many thousands of miles per hour. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=168.72s)]
*  So that will have tremendous forces imparted on the reentry vehicle. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=172.72s)]
*  And what kind of temperatures are we talking about? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  Many thousands of degrees. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=180.26s)]
*  North Korea cannot attack the U.S. with a nuclear weapon until it develops a reentry [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=182.94s)]
*  vehicle that can stand that kind of heat. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=187.44s)]
*  This is the setup before the test. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=189.96s)]
*  Hugh Griffiths is head of the team which monitors the North Korean missile program [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=192.36s)]
*  for the U.N. Security Council. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=196.0s)]
*  He says these pictures released by the regime last year were an attempt to prove it had [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=198.44000000000003s)]
*  already succeeded. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=203.12s)]
*  A reentry vehicle was subjected to a rocket engine blast. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  Is that a realistic test? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=208.78000000000003s)]
*  We assess that it wasn't sufficiently realistic to be credible. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=210.9s)]
*  Because the rocket engine does not create enough heat? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=220.28000000000003s)]
*  The heat produced by the rocket engine is not sufficient to mimic what this would experience [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=221.28s)]
*  reentering the Earth's atmosphere. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=226.52s)]
*  North Korea released a picture of the scorched reentry vehicle and this one of its 33-year-old [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=228.76s)]
*  leader Kim Jong-un being shown how little had been burned away. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=234.48s)]
*  The idea of this narrative is to prove that yet another requirement of the nuclear and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=239.12s)]
*  ballistic missile program has been achieved. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=245.18s)]
*  Kim Jong-un seems to be everywhere. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=248.68s)]
*  Does it strike you as unusual that you would have a head of state inspecting a reentry [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=251.96s)]
*  vehicle? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=257.2s)]
*  Yeah, the whole thing is inconceivable and out of like some bad science fiction film [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=258.2s)]
*  the man is intimately connected with the whole program and this is very deliberate and very [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  unusual. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=272.76s)]
*  Almost all of North Korea's missiles from long range down to short range are carried [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=274.68s)]
*  on mobile launchers. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=278.64s)]
*  This is a short range SCUD developed by Russia in the 1950s and sold to countries all over [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=280.72s)]
*  the world. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=286.56s)]
*  This one belongs to the Missile and Space Intelligence Center in Huntsville, Alabama. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  This is a Russian SCUD-B. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=292.68s)]
*  Senior intelligence analyst Steve Hancock says the SCUD can be launched straight off [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=295.24s)]
*  the back of this truck. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=299.16s)]
*  It is mobile and even to this day it's a very challenging aspect of the missile force [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=300.44s)]
*  for us to deal with. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=305.68s)]
*  A moving target is harder to hit? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=307.92s)]
*  Yes sir. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=309.84s)]
*  It's harder to find as well. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=310.84s)]
*  Hancock says a well-trained crew can raise, aim and fire a SCUD in 18 minutes. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=313.8s)]
*  Do they use these exact same procedures if they're launching a longer range missile? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=318.92s)]
*  Yes, they're going to be very similar. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  Is the launch time still about 18 minutes? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  So the bigger the missile gets, it's probably going to get to be a little bit slower, but [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=331.08s)]
*  we don't know the exact launch times for all of the systems. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=335.4s)]
*  Inside the Missile and Space Intelligence Center there's another SCUD, laid out like [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=339.64s)]
*  a corpse on an autopsy table. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  These are graphite rudders that sit in the exhaust of the missile and are used to steer [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=346.52s)]
*  the missile. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=350.0s)]
*  Marie, we agreed not to use her last name, is a missile engineer whose job is to know [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=351.0s)]
*  as much about the SCUD as the people who built it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=356.04s)]
*  This is the instrument section where the guidance equipment sits, so there's a lot of complex [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=359.16s)]
*  equipment in here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  Is that part made of what it looks like it's made of? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  Plywood, yeah it is. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=367.6s)]
*  Plywood? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=368.6s)]
*  It saves a lot of weight putting that wood in there instead of metal. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=369.6s)]
*  Plywood just doesn't sound like rocket science. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=372.88s)]
*  It doesn't feel that way to us as Westerners. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=375.68s)]
*  They don't invest resources where it's not necessary. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=379.36s)]
*  It only has a range of 186 miles but it would reach its target in about five minutes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=382.6s)]
*  So then we get up to the real serious part of this missile which is what we call the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=388.0s)]
*  payload. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  The payload is everything including the warhead that sits inside this cavity. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=392.20000000000005s)]
*  It can carry about a thousand kilogram or 2200 pound payload. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  But here's the feature that sets this SCUD apart. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=399.96000000000004s)]
*  This was designed to be a nuclear trainer and you can tell because the thickness of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=402.92s)]
*  the aeroshell here is more than what it would be for a standard high explosive warhead. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=406.64000000000004s)]
*  A nuclear trainer. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=411.12s)]
*  This missile is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=412.12s)]
*  This missile as designed by Russia was intended to carry a nuclear warhead. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=414.56s)]
*  A nuclear capable weapon with a five minute flight time? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=418.76000000000005s)]
*  It doesn't give you much time to react. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=424.20000000000005s)]
*  It doesn't give you much does it? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=426.12s)]
*  Last March North Korea launched a salvo of four SCUDs simultaneously in what it said [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=430.36s)]
*  was a drill to attack US military bases. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  What's the purpose of firing a salvo of missiles? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=438.68s)]
*  So a salvo is intended to overwhelm your defenses. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=443.0s)]
*  Senior weapons analyst Scott McDonald took us into the Computer Simulation Center. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=447.12s)]
*  So what goes on in this room? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=450.72s)]
*  To show how missiles like those would perform in flight. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=452.36s)]
*  So as the videos from North Korea end when they go into the clouds we're able to represent [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=455.32s)]
*  the entire flight of the missile by putting this into a digital representation. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=460.32s)]
*  This looks a lot like a cartoon or a video game but this is really a lot different. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=466.0s)]
*  There's a lot of hard science and math that goes behind this. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=470.88s)]
*  At this point the only defense would be to shoot them down which is why these computer [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=475.2s)]
*  simulations go into so much detail. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=479.08s)]
*  So this is reverse engineering? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=481.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=483.88s)]
*  That's what would happen as it was re-entering? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=484.88s)]
*  Correct. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=487.28s)]
*  So it's showing kind of a tumbling motion and you can see the pressure waves coming [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=488.28s)]
*  off of that missile. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=492.02s)]
*  That's the aerodynamic forces that are acting on that missile and that's how we understand [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=493.4s)]
*  how it's going to fly. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=498.03999999999996s)]
*  The SCUD can reach targets in South Korea where 28,500 American troops are based. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=499.52s)]
*  Another North Korean missile called the Nodong has a great enough range to hit Japan where [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=506.23999999999995s)]
*  54,000 American servicemen are stationed. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=511.35999999999996s)]
*  It's a scaled up SCUD missile. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=514.8s)]
*  Mark Clark is director of the Military and Space Intelligence Center. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=517.68s)]
*  Japan and South Korea and all the Americans living there are already in range of nuclear [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=521.48s)]
*  capable missiles? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=526.9200000000001s)]
*  They're certainly in range of SCUD and Nodong class missiles, absolutely. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=528.96s)]
*  How many SCUD and Nodong class missiles do the North Koreans have? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=533.96s)]
*  Hundreds. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=538.6400000000001s)]
*  Hundreds? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=539.6400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=540.6400000000001s)]
*  Clark would not discuss classified intelligence about North Korea but he did tell us this. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=541.6400000000001s)]
*  We have insights today that we didn't have a few years ago. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  Which has? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=549.76s)]
*  I'm hesitant to go into sources and methods except to say there are opportunities we've [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=551.8s)]
*  had to observe and learn about the ballistic missile threats there. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=557.88s)]
*  In February 2016, the U.S. and its allies got their hands on another missile, this time [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=563.28s)]
*  a long range one, part of a rocket North Korea used to launch a satellite into orbit. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=569.34s)]
*  The satellite never really functioned. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=574.88s)]
*  It wasn't a serious satellite but it was a serious rocket. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=577.06s)]
*  The UN's Hugh Griffiths says the rocket was really a test vehicle for an intercontinental [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=581.18s)]
*  ballistic missile and a large part of it fell into the sea. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=585.5s)]
*  The South Korean Navy got to this location and when debris fell from the sky they were [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=589.5s)]
*  able to recover some of that debris and invited us to inspect it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=597.02s)]
*  So you physically got your hands on some of the components that had been used? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=601.6199999999999s)]
*  Yes, we were very lucky. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=606.78s)]
*  We were able to photograph the debris, take it apart and run checks on the serial numbers [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=608.02s)]
*  of quite a variety of components. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=614.8399999999999s)]
*  In the past two years, North Korea has conducted more than 40 test launches, virtually every [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=619.26s)]
*  one of them personally approved and supervised by Kim Jong Un. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=624.6999999999999s)]
*  What he's shown is that he has a tolerance for failure. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=628.8399999999999s)]
*  Tom Boyd, senior intelligence analyst for ballistic missiles at the Air and Space Intelligence [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=632.3s)]
*  Center, means that as a compliment. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=636.8199999999999s)]
*  If you are not willing to fail in the ballistic missile or space launch vehicle missile business, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=639.38s)]
*  you're in the wrong business. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=646.38s)]
*  It's almost inevitable. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=647.56s)]
*  These are highly complex systems and failures are pretty much inevitable. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=648.62s)]
*  So 2016 saw a lot of failures. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=655.38s)]
*  I can't recall the exact number, but he did have significant failures. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=660.28s)]
*  And not so many this year. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=665.14s)]
*  He's having much, much better success this year. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=666.5799999999999s)]
*  So it just looks like they figured something out. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=669.28s)]
*  Yes, I think they have learned from their failures. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=671.6s)]
*  What North Korea figured out is a high-thrust engine, seen here in a ground test, and a [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  high-performance fuel to power it. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=680.52s)]
*  Would you say that engine and that fuel is responsible for their recent successes? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=683.24s)]
*  They seem to be getting good performance, yes. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=691.34s)]
*  The Pentagon says it's confident its missile defense system, 42 interceptors based in Alaska [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=695.7800000000001s)]
*  and California, can shoot down a North Korean ICBM, although the test record shows only [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=700.88s)]
*  a 55 percent success rate. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=707.4200000000001s)]
*  Since May, it's shot down this mock North Korean missile, which was designed from models [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=710.62s)]
*  developed by the Air and Space Intelligence Center. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=714.78s)]
*  Despite that most recent success, ICBMs are what Boyd calls a challenging target. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=718.38s)]
*  They've been referred to as the ultimate weapon. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=724.18s)]
*  They get to the target very quickly. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=726.3s)]
*  An ICBM has a reentry velocity on the order of four to five miles per second, so there's [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=729.74s)]
*  very little time to react. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=735.32s)]
*  So how long before North Korea can really threaten the American homeland with an ICBM? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=737.86s)]
*  Probably several more flight tests, but ultimately if they want to have confidence that the system [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=743.32s)]
*  works as intended, they have to flight test it and prove that that reentry vehicle can [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=750.3000000000001s)]
*  survive realistic reentry conditions. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=755.22s)]
*  So that really is then the moment of truth. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=758.6800000000001s)]
*  When they launch, if they launch, a ballistic missile out over the Pacific Ocean at a range [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=763.14s)]
*  approximating what it would take to reach the United States. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=770.62s)]
*  That would give them higher confidence that the system really works as they want it to. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=775.16s)]
*  At the rate North Korea is testing, U.S. intelligence estimates that could happen as early as next year. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=781.74s)]
*  In Thursday's press conference, President Trump would not say how the United States [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=793.14s)]
*  will respond to the actions of North Korea's dictator over the last week. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=802.9s)]
*  Kim Jong-un tested a new type of missile. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=807.6999999999999s)]
*  Then his estranged brother was poisoned in a Malaysian airport. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=810.8199999999999s)]
*  South Korea's spy agency believes Kim ordered the hit. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=815.02s)]
*  Kim has nuclear weapons and has promised to test an intercontinental ballistic missile. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=819.7s)]
*  Such a weapon could eventually carry a nuclear warhead and threaten American cities. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=825.58s)]
*  That possibility and the missiles he has aimed at South Korea are so dangerous, U.S. Defense [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=831.66s)]

*  We got two important perspectives. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=848.2s)]
*  We spoke to the commander of the 28,000 American troops there, as well as the highest-ranking [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=851.4000000000001s)]

*  of his regime. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=867.12s)]
*  I've been in Seoul for six months and to be honest, I was never public until now. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=869.44s)]
*  We went for an evening out in Seoul with Tae-young Ho. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=877.36s)]
*  He was North Korea's deputy ambassador in London before he defected in August. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=881.28s)]
*  First time on the subway. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=886.2s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=888.36s)]
*  A defection by someone of his rank is extremely rare. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=889.76s)]
*  Where do we stand? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=893.36s)]
*  This was the first time he had walked about in public. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=895.08s)]
*  Just off camera, six bodyguards watched his every move as we made our way down one of [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=898.9s)]
*  the busiest shopping streets in Asia. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=904.56s)]

*  In order to prevent more possible defections from North Korea, I think Kim Jong-un may [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=911.1199999999999s)]
*  do anything. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=916.8s)]
*  He will kill you. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=917.8s)]
*  Of course, why not? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=918.8s)]
*  The man who could order an assassination is Kim Jong-un. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=923.8s)]

*  Tae said he was living a comfortable life here at the North Korean embassy in London [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1016.96s)]
*  before he fled with his wife and two grown sons. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1022.52s)]
*  His job in London was to spread North Korean propaganda and report back on his colleagues. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1029.92s)]
*  You all live together under one roof? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1037.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1038.8000000000002s)]
*  So you could keep an eye on each other? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1039.8000000000002s)]
*  Keep an eye on each other, control each other and even spy on each other. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1041.6000000000001s)]
*  But Tae said he lost all faith in the regime when Kim Jong-un killed his own uncle in 2013 [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1048.28s)]
*  and executed dozens of perceived enemies, including diplomats. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1055.76s)]
*  I've seen tape of you giving speeches in London. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1060.72s)]
*  You're very convincing. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1066.8s)]
*  You seem to be a true believer yourself. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1069.44s)]
*  If I show any sign of hesitation, then I would be, you know... [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1074.04s)]
*  I would be sent to prison camps. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1085.24s)]
*  So my whole family's life will be jeopardized. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1089.48s)]
*  Tae said there was one big obstacle to his defection. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1094.4s)]
*  All North Korean diplomats are forced to leave one of their children back in Pyongyang as [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1098.76s)]
*  a hostage. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1111.16s)]
*  As a hostage? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1113.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1114.64s)]
*  When my children grow up... [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1115.64s)]
*  His break came when that policy unexpectedly changed and Tae's oldest son was allowed to [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1117.72s)]
*  join the family in London. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1123.52s)]
*  They all agreed to defect. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1125.56s)]
*  He would not give us the details of his escape and who helped, but we know he was kept in [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1128.1200000000001s)]
*  a safe house by South Korean intelligence agents and questioned for more than three [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1133.44s)]
*  months. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1138.28s)]
*  He said it was too dangerous for us to meet his family. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1139.28s)]
*  I've been talking to you for a couple of days now. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1143.4s)]
*  You come from a secretive place. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1145.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1148.56s)]
*  But I think you still have lots of secrets. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1149.56s)]
*  Sure, yes. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1154.96s)]
*  How do we know that what he is telling us is the truth and not just self-serving? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1157.76s)]
*  You know, when a defector makes a decision to jump ship, he is doing it at a huge cost. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1164.96s)]
*  His co-workers, relatives, in-laws will be purged or killed. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1171.24s)]
*  Chung Min Lee was South Korea's ambassador for national security until last year. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1176.04s)]
*  He said looks here can be deceiving. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1181.76s)]
*  The risk of war today is exceptionally high. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1184.88s)]
*  I think most Americans right now would see this as a holdover from the Cold War. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1188.64s)]
*  But it seems to be quite hot when you're here. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1195.0s)]
*  This is the only place on the entire planet where you have nearly a million forces on [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1199.96s)]
*  both sides standing ready to fight a war in basically a nanosecond. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1204.96s)]
*  And who is there right in the middle of this? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1210.68s)]
*  It's basically the U.S. forces. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1213.04s)]
*  If there is war, this is where the big fight will take place. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1214.52s)]
*  Lee helped shape Seoul's policy toward North Korea. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1218.64s)]
*  He went with us to Panmunjom, the village in the two-and-a-half-mile-wide demilitarized [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1222.78s)]
*  zone that separates North and South Korea. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1227.96s)]
*  As we got closer, Seoul's sprawl gave way to military checkpoints. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1231.48s)]
*  The agreement that suspended the Korean War was signed here. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1239.48s)]
*  But there's still no peace treaty. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1243.42s)]
*  The war began when the communist North invaded in 1950. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1247.52s)]
*  Thirty-four thousand Americans were killed in what amounted to a stalemate. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1251.92s)]
*  So this is the longest war on paper since World War II. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1257.6s)]
*  So we are still technically in a state of war. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1261.28s)]
*  Today, both sides still stare each other down. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1263.9599999999998s)]
*  That's North Korea right there, that building just 100 yards away. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1267.8s)]
*  We were told to avoid sudden movements that could be interpreted as threatening. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1272.1399999999999s)]
*  It wasn't long before North Korean soldiers took an interest in all the activity. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1277.08s)]
*  So we went inside a negotiation hut that straddles the border. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1282.02s)]
*  What is right behind the door? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1286.4199999999998s)]
*  The door is basically from there on, since this is North Korea, once you go out, that's [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1288.24s)]
*  it. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1293.7s)]
*  We have no jurisdiction on that side of the door. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1294.7s)]
*  So if I were to walk out that door, I'm in the hands of North Korea. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1300.02s)]
*  That's true. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1304.02s)]
*  Let's stay on this side. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1305.02s)]
*  Let's stay on this side. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1306.02s)]
*  It was all surreal. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1307.02s)]
*  This part of the DMZ closest to Seoul had the feel of a Cold War theme park, complete [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1310.28s)]
*  with a fake village on the North Korean side built to impress the South. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1316.5s)]
*  And in case you missed the point, loudspeakers blared propaganda. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1324.18s)]
*  Marshall songs praising Kim Jong-un. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1330.02s)]
*  A few miles away, tourists crowded an observation deck, snapping photos with troops, cardboard [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1333.42s)]
*  cutouts and the real ones. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1341.6999999999998s)]
*  What the visitors could not see on the other side of those mountains are 10,000 artillery [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1347.6999999999998s)]
*  pieces the North Korean military has aimed at Seoul, all of which could reach the 28 [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1353.1599999999999s)]
*  million people in and around the South Korean capital. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1359.46s)]
*  U.S. war planners estimate 500,000 people could be killed in a second Korean war. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1363.3s)]
*  Is there any other metropolitan area on Earth that's vulnerable? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1370.34s)]
*  Certainly nothing that approaches Seoul in terms of the size, the density of the population. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1377.34s)]
*  There's nothing like it. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1384.34s)]
*  U.S. Air Force General James Slife flew with us over the city. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1386.34s)]
*  It's just 30 miles from the DMZ. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1391.06s)]
*  We landed at Osan Air Base, where Korean airmen and their American colleagues monitor all [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1394.34s)]
*  activity north of the DMZ. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1400.4199999999998s)]
*  For security, they shut off the giant video displays right before we came in. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1403.6s)]
*  This facility is among the first to detect North Korean missile launches. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1409.78s)]
*  You're like on a war footing all the time here. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1414.9399999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1417.1399999999999s)]
*  This is truly one of those places where the best way to prevent a war is being ready for [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1418.1399999999999s)]
*  a war. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1422.58s)]
*  The North's latest missile test used a new type of solid fuel engine and was fired from [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1424.06s)]
*  a mobile launcher, making it quick to deploy and difficult for U.S. satellites to detect [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1429.7s)]
*  in real time. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1435.58s)]
*  With the development of ballistic missiles, with the development of nuclear weapons, things [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1437.06s)]
*  here have a tension that you can feel in the air as you move around places like this. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1441.8999999999999s)]
*  We wanted to talk to the general who leads U.S. forces in Korea and would command Korean [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1449.82s)]
*  troops in the event of a war. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1455.3s)]
*  He asked to meet us at Guard Post 4. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1457.74s)]
*  It's a citadel on critical high ground at the end of a road lined with landmines. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1461.1s)]
*  We were the first American news crew allowed in. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1467.06s)]
*  This was no Cold War theme park. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1472.3s)]
*  Body armor was required and artillery was on standby in the event we came under fire. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1475.42s)]
*  Hello, General. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1481.42s)]
*  Nice to see you. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1482.42s)]
*  Very nice to meet you. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1483.42s)]
*  General Vincent Brooks has commanded U.S. forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1485.14s)]
*  I don't think people at home know how tense this line is. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1490.82s)]
*  What it takes to go from the condition we're in at this moment to hostilities again is [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1495.3600000000001s)]
*  literally the matter of a decision on North Korea's side to say fire. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1501.1s)]
*  And on top of this, we have the missile capability that's been developed. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1505.8999999999999s)]
*  Over 120 missiles fired just in the time of Kim Jong-un alone. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1509.9399999999998s)]
*  So now they're talking about ICBMs that might be able to reach the west coast of the United [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1513.78s)]
*  States. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1517.74s)]
*  How do you stop them from taking that next step? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1519.1s)]
*  North Korea is responsible for the direction that the region is going. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1524.06s)]
*  It is responsible for the conditions of instability that are starting to arise. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1528.14s)]
*  It has to take responsibility for that and stop. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1533.46s)]
*  His country is poor. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1536.5800000000002s)]
*  His people are starving. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1537.66s)]
*  What is it that he wants? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1540.3000000000002s)]
*  Survival and recognition. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1543.66s)]
*  Kim Jong-un is now recognized as a global threat. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1546.66s)]
*  U.S. intelligence estimates he has at least 10 nuclear weapons. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1550.3400000000001s)]
*  If the U.S. decided it had no choice but to launch a preemptive strike on an ICBM test [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1555.18s)]
*  site, it could trigger the unthinkable. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1560.98s)]
*  If North Korea uses nuclear weapons, it will be met with an effective and overwhelming [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1564.14s)]
*  response. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=1569.18s)]

*  We would have to give the president answers to a lot of different questions. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2027.6399999999999s)]
*  That's one that I would expect to get. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2032.24s)]
*  Ad Mojaney would go to a room called the battle deck where he would talk directly to the president. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2035.32s)]
*  And is this the phone you would use? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2040.24s)]
*  This is one of the phones I might use, yes. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2043.0s)]
*  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of Defense. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2046.8s)]
*  I don't see the man who controls. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2050.2s)]
*  You're looking for the president. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2052.08s)]
*  I am. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2053.56s)]
*  But I can speak to the president directly from this microphone. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2054.56s)]
*  And in a crisis, how long does it take to get the president on the line? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2057.92s)]
*  Very long. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2061.44s)]
*  If Russia launched a missile from a submarine off the coast of the United States, it would [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2063.68s)]
*  take only minutes to reach its target. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2067.68s)]
*  So how long, in fact, does the president have to make a decision? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2070.2000000000003s)]
*  He has minutes, seven, eight, nine, depending on details, but less than 10 minutes. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2074.92s)]
*  Former Secretary of Defense William Perry was a key architect of nuclear weapons during [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2081.44s)]
*  the Cold War with the Soviet Union. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2085.88s)]
*  If the weapons can be launched within minutes, does that mean we're still in the same old [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2088.44s)]
*  hair trigger standoff that we were during the Cold War? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2094.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2098.56s)]
*  And we still have launch on warning, the same policy we had then. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2100.16s)]
*  We still have the same hair trigger response. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2102.76s)]
*  So what's changed since the Cold War, if we're still on this hair trigger alert? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2105.04s)]
*  Fundamentally, nothing has changed. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2110.36s)]
*  But the numbers of weapons are much lower now than during the Cold War. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2113.0s)]
*  The number of weapons are sufficient to destroy, obliterate all of civilization. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2118.04s)]
*  Still? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2122.4s)]
*  Still. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2123.4s)]
*  It doesn't take that many. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2124.4s)]
*  We still have more than a thousand nuclear weapons on alert, ready to go. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2126.8s)]
*  It doesn't take a thousand to destroy civilization. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2135.44s)]
*  At the end of the Cold War, both sides pledged to point their missiles at the open ocean. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2139.16s)]
*  But it would take just minutes to change back to real targets. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2143.92s)]
*  That provides a small hedge against an accidental war triggered by a false alarm of the kind [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2147.88s)]
*  Perry experienced in 1979, when a watch officer mistakenly inserted a training tape into a [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2153.12s)]
*  computer. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2159.48s)]
*  So it looked like 200 ICBMs were on the way from the Soviet Union to the United States. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2160.48s)]
*  Happily, we got that situation figured out before we had to go to the president. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2166.2000000000003s)]
*  But had we not, he would have received a call at 3 o'clock in the morning and said, sir, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2170.2000000000003s)]
*  You have seven or eight minutes to decide where to launch this before these missiles [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2174.28s)]
*  land on our ICBM silos. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2177.6400000000003s)]
*  And what was the failsafe there? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2180.48s)]
*  What stopped it from going to the president? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2182.52s)]
*  What stopped it was an astute general who sensed something was wrong. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2186.2400000000002s)]
*  If you've had one serious case in 45 years, that would seem like a pretty good record. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2194.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it only takes one. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2201.84s)]
*  It only takes one. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2206.48s)]
*  Strategic Command is building a new $1.2 billion headquarters. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2209.6400000000003s)]
*  But it won't be any more able to survive a nuclear blast than the Underground Command [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2213.92s)]
*  Center in the current headquarters. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2218.6000000000004s)]
*  That clock counting down the time to missile impact would also tell Admiral Haney how long [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2221.2000000000003s)]
*  he had to get out of there alive. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2226.1400000000003s)]
*  The safe escape time that you see indicated is the time left remaining for Admiral Haney, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2229.8799999999997s)]
*  as the commander of USTRACCOM, to exit the battle deck, to be able to make it to his [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2235.8799999999997s)]
*  commander support aircraft, to be able to board that aircraft and continue to provide [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2241.4399999999996s)]
*  his advice to the president of the United States as his senior nuclear advisor. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2246.48s)]
*  On the tarmac at STRATCOM, air crews drill to take off from this airborne command post, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2253.64s)]
*  fast enough to escape incoming nuclear weapons. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2258.84s)]
*  If Admiral Haney's headquarters were destroyed and he didn't make it out in time, it would [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2262.6400000000003s)]
*  be up to Rear Admiral Andy Lennon to assume command and make sure the president and only [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2267.96s)]
*  the president could still give the order to launch nuclear weapons. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2273.6800000000003s)]
*  We are in voice communications with the president. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2277.48s)]
*  Talking to the president in person. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2279.4s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2281.32s)]
*  So that way we are ensuring that we're getting the president's intent. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2282.32s)]
*  How do you know it's the president? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2285.52s)]
*  We have some very complex and secure procedures to authenticate the president and to be sure [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2287.36s)]
*  that we're really talking to the president of the United States. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2293.48s)]
*  So he can't just tell you this is the president speaking? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2296.8s)]
*  He can, but we will authenticate to verify that it is the president speaking. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2300.7200000000003s)]
*  Once the president has given you that order, what do you do? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2305.0800000000004s)]
*  Then we would communicate that order to our strategic forces, our intercontinental ballistic [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2309.6000000000004s)]
*  missiles, our bombers, or our submarines. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2313.92s)]
*  Keep the watch, sound the general alarm. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2317.04s)]
*  Sound the general alarm, aye sir. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2318.2s)]
*  The order would be received on board the Kentucky and the crew would go through launch procedures [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2319.96s)]
*  they have practiced hundreds of times before. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2324.6s)]
*  Last year the Kentucky actually fired an unarmed missile in a test flight which lit up the [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2328.44s)]
*  California sky and caused a brief UFO scare. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2333.04s)]
*  Had it carried a real warhead. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2337.48s)]
*  This is our meteorological effects officer. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2338.92s)]
*  Stuart Miller, a young Air Force captain aboard the Airborne Command Post, would begin charting [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2341.84s)]
*  the unthinkable. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2346.78s)]
*  My main role is gathering information on nuclear detonations worldwide and then applying meteorological [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2348.26s)]
*  data to them, specifically winds, to figure out if there's fallout, depending on the attributes [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2355.02s)]
*  of the detonation, where the fallout's going, how many people might be affected, who might [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2361.1200000000003s)]
*  be affected, things of that nature. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2366.46s)]
*  So you basically come up with a casualty estimate of... [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2370.9s)]
*  Essentially yes, that's one of the things that I can provide. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2374.7s)]
*  You must have looked at some pretty depressing scenarios. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2378.86s)]
*  We kind of do, yeah. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2381.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2385.06s)]
*  Have you ever had the conversation with yourself, well what if the president issued an order [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2388.4s)]
*  to use nuclear weapons and I didn't agree with it, would I carry out that order? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2393.98s)]
*  The president expects me as his combatant commander to provide him the best military [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2399.2999999999997s)]
*  advice I have. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2405.54s)]
*  So he would expect me to voice my opinion. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2407.2999999999997s)]
*  You would have a voice, but if you disagreed with the decision... [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2411.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm a military man and we follow the orders of our commander in chief. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2415.74s)]
*  NATO, which just marked its 70th anniversary, is widely considered the gold standard of [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2429.14s)]
*  military alliances, binding countries on both sides of the Atlantic in common cause against [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2436.98s)]
*  Russian aggression. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2443.1s)]
*  But President Trump complains that other members of the alliance don't pay their fair share [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2445.02s)]
*  of what it costs to defend Europe against the intimidation tactics of Vladimir Putin. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2449.46s)]
*  The president has told A's he doesn't see the point of the alliance and has even mentioned [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2455.26s)]
*  withdrawing from NATO. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2459.5400000000004s)]
*  Despite those misgivings, the US and its NATO allies have been steadily increasing the frequency [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2461.94s)]
*  and size of their military exercises. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2467.26s)]
*  Last fall, NATO held the largest one yet in Norway, one of the countries President Trump [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2470.78s)]
*  has singled out for failing to spend enough on defense. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2476.38s)]
*  You might not think of Norway, which has a tiny military, as a vital NATO ally. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2480.58s)]
*  But we found a country that is on the front lines with Russia and serves as NATO's eyes [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2485.74s)]
*  and ears in the high north. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2491.36s)]
*  Norway's F-16s are on 15-minute alert 24-7. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2494.62s)]
*  Every time Russian military aircraft are detected, these pilots scramble to intercept them. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2501.3s)]
*  The shots they bring back show nuclear-capable Russian bombers as they fly up and down the [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2509.7s)]
*  Norwegian coast. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2514.3399999999997s)]
*  Most of the encounters are routine. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2516.54s)]
*  But sometimes, says Lieutenant General Rune Jakobsen, Norway's Joint Force Commander, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2520.7799999999997s)]
*  they're anything but. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2525.66s)]
*  What we have seen lately is aggressive flying and simulated attacks against Norwegian exercises. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2528.1s)]
*  Simulated attacks? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2542.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2543.2999999999997s)]
*  How do you know it's a simulated attack? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2544.2999999999997s)]
*  An airman knows what an attack looks like. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2546.38s)]
*  So they go to the point at which they would release their weapons? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2549.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2553.38s)]
*  Jakobsen tracked those simulated attacks from his command center buried deep inside a mountain. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2554.94s)]
*  After the Cold War ended, a nuclear-proof bunker seemed positively old-fashioned, until [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2560.98s)]
*  lately when Russia became more threatening. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2566.42s)]
*  This is an illustration of a Russian attack formation, simulated attack, that was flown [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2569.9s)]
*  in May 2017, not far north of this position. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2577.06s)]
*  And the red dot is the target? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2582.94s)]
*  Red dot is the target. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2585.38s)]
*  That doesn't look like the act of a friendly country. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2586.38s)]
*  No, that's not something you should do to your neighbor. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2589.62s)]
*  Norway shares a 120-mile border with its neighbor, Russia. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2594.98s)]
*  It is some of the most remote, rugged and beautiful landscape in all of Europe. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2598.38s)]
*  Captain Karina Vinterdahl guards the northern sector with 120 soldiers. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2604.78s)]
*  They are along the border all the time, 24-7. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2610.06s)]
*  I have people along the border. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2612.42s)]
*  So I have four observation posts that are manned at all times throughout the whole year. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2614.26s)]
*  Are your soldiers armed? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2622.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2623.26s)]
*  Do they ever have to use their weapons? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2624.26s)]
*  No, but we have to be prepared. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2626.46s)]
*  We went to the most remote of those outposts in the high north of the Norwegian mainland. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2629.7000000000003s)]
*  One unit was just finishing its three weeks on watch and a new one coming in. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2635.26s)]
*  To get there, you have to lug your gear up a long, steep staircase, part of which is [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2640.62s)]
*  covered over to defend against the Arctic winter. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2646.2999999999997s)]
*  The observation post is manned year-round, and once you get to the top, you can see why [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2650.74s)]
*  it's worth the trouble. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2655.2599999999998s)]
*  These Norwegian soldiers are able to look deep into Russia and far out to sea, making [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2657.2599999999998s)]
*  this a key piece of terrain for the NATO alliance. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2662.42s)]
*  That's Russia over there, and this is where the border with Norway ends. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2667.22s)]
*  It's NATO's northernmost flank, and you don't need to be a military expert to know you can [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2671.4199999999996s)]
*  never leave your flank exposed. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2675.98s)]
*  That includes the Barents Sea out there. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2678.58s)]
*  Those are the home operating waters of Russia's northern fleet and are kept under constant [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2681.24s)]
*  surveillance by the U.S. and Norway. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2686.12s)]
*  This map shows what lies just over the horizon on that thumb of land called the Kola Peninsula. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2689.9199999999996s)]
*  It is the home of Russia's northern fleet, naval bases, airfields and nuclear weapons [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2696.16s)]
*  storage sites, which represent that country's single greatest concentration of military [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2701.24s)]
*  power, especially submarines. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2706.3199999999997s)]
*  They have a very capable submarine force, and we've seen an increase in submarine activity [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2710.3999999999996s)]
*  over the last few years that causes me pause. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2716.16s)]
*  Admiral James Fogle, the commander of U.S. naval forces in Europe, is particularly concerned [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2719.52s)]
*  about this submarine, the Severodvinsk, nuclear-powered and armed with land-attack cruise missiles [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2724.92s)]
*  with a range greater than 1,000 miles. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2731.76s)]
*  The Severodvinsk is a brand new class of submarine, and it's very capable, it's very quiet. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2735.08s)]
*  So that's the most important thing, I think, in submarine warfare. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2740.28s)]
*  When you say quiet, you're saying harder to detect, harder to track. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2744.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2749.36s)]
*  Does that sub come down into the Atlantic? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2751.28s)]
*  I suffice it to say that the Russians have increased their presence in all bodies of [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2754.52s)]
*  water around Europe and in the Atlantic. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2760.32s)]
*  Have you ever lost the Severodvinsk? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2763.44s)]
*  I'd rather not comment on submarine operations to that specific level of detail. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2766.64s)]
*  Fogle won't comment, but Pentagon officials told 60 Minutes that last summer the Severodvinsk [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2772.72s)]
*  slipped into the Atlantic Ocean and for weeks evaded all attempts to find it. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2777.8s)]
*  At peacetime, losing a Russian sub in the Atlantic is embarrassing. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2784.24s)]
*  In a crisis, it could be a disaster. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2788.3999999999996s)]
*  Think about the global infrastructure that rests on the bottom of the ocean. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2791.64s)]
*  You're talking about the undersea cables. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2796.52s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2798.56s)]
*  Those fiber optic cables carry 99.4% of the data exchanged over the Internet by the U.S. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2800.12s)]
*  and its allies and trading partners. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2806.9599999999996s)]
*  Depending on your point of view, they are either the backbone or the Achilles heel of [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2809.3999999999996s)]
*  the world economy. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2814.16s)]
*  Have Russian submarines gotten close to those undersea cables? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2816.48s)]
*  I'm not at liberty to talk about any of that. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2820.8799999999997s)]
*  That's because tracking Russian submarines is a top secret, day in, day out game of hide [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2824.48s)]
*  and seek. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2829.3999999999996s)]
*  But the Norwegian military allowed 60 Minutes aboard one of its maritime patrol planes to [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2831.52s)]
*  see what sub hunting looks like. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2836.3999999999996s)]
*  The pilot, co-pilot and engineer are up front, while the crew in the back scans the Norwegian [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2839.44s)]
*  Sea with radar and high-powered cameras. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2844.88s)]
*  Flying at less than 300 feet, they can clearly make out anything on the surface, including [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2848.28s)]
*  passing cargo ships. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2853.4s)]
*  For what's under the water, they drop patterns of sonobuys which send out sound waves that [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2855.52s)]
*  will bounce off a submerged submarine. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2862.08s)]
*  Major Leif Otterholm, the plane's tactical coordinator, has been flying these missions [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2866.72s)]
*  since the 1980s. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2870.72s)]
*  It is very important to collect on remote locations. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2871.72s)]
*  How big an area is it that you have to cover? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2875.44s)]
*  The area of operation for this kind of aircraft is six times larger than the area of land [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2878.7599999999998s)]
*  in Norway, so it's quite big. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2884.64s)]
*  So how frequently do you encounter the Russians out here? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2887.64s)]
*  We encounter them regularly when we go further east. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2892.48s)]
*  Further east lies the headquarters of the Northern Fleet, and Norwegian patrol planes [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2896.96s)]
*  frequently spot Russian submarines while they're still on the surface. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2901.64s)]
*  But the most valuable intelligence is collected by a ship, one you've never heard of. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2906.2s)]
*  There it is, down there in the harbor, the crown jewel of Norway's fleet. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2911.6s)]
*  That's Norway's newest spy ship, the Marjada. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2917.08s)]
*  It's at sea nearly 300 days a year monitoring the Northern Fleet, but just happened to be [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2920.08s)]
*  in port the day we arrived here in Kirkenes, the town closest to the Russian border. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2925.08s)]
*  The Marjada flies the Norwegian flag, but much of its eavesdropping equipment comes [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2931.08s)]
*  from the U.S. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2935.92s)]
*  Its mission is to collect intelligence on the operations of Russia's Northern Fleet, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2937.7599999999998s)]
*  which Lieutenant General Jakobsen says is arming itself with a new generation of precision-guided [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2945.72s)]
*  weapons and testing them in the waters off Norway. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2950.7599999999998s)]
*  Are you able to monitor those? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2957.04s)]
*  Yeah, because most of the testing of new equipment is done up north of the Kola Peninsula, and [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2959.3199999999997s)]
*  we are present there every day with our maritime patrol aircrafts and our vessels at sea. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2966.12s)]
*  The daily hall of intelligence, all of which is directly relayed to the U.S. and NATO, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2973.66s)]
*  didn't stop President Trump from sending this letter of complaint. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2979.18s)]
*  Norway, he wrote, is the only NATO ally sharing a border with Russia that lacks a credible [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2983.1s)]
*  plan to spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2989.6s)]
*  Well, I think that he has a fair point in pointing out that we need to step up. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2993.66s)]
*  Ina Eriksen Sirida is Norway's foreign minister, the first woman to hold the job. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=2999.5s)]
*  So these are all your predecessors? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3005.14s)]
*  They are, they are. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3007.1s)]
*  And they're all men. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3008.66s)]
*  And they're all men. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3009.66s)]
*  You're the first woman. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3010.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3011.9s)]
*  Before that, she was defense minister in 2014, when all the members of NATO pledged to increase [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3012.9s)]
*  their military spending to 2 percent of their GDP. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3019.02s)]
*  So have you met that pledge? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3022.62s)]
*  No, we haven't met it yet, but we are moving in the right direction. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3024.7s)]
*  We are doing a lot of big investments. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3028.66s)]
*  The biggest of those investments is the American-made F-35, a stealth fighter designed to evade [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3031.58s)]
*  state-of-the-art air defenses. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3037.42s)]
*  It will dramatically increase operational capabilities, both in the high north and beyond. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3039.6s)]
*  Norway is buying 52 of them at a cost of $89 million each. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3046.46s)]
*  It's a very expensive airplane. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3050.58s)]
*  Well, and it also functions well, and it has capabilities that we need. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3053.06s)]
*  Our F-16 has served us well, but they are starting to get old. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3057.5s)]
*  Those F-16s are going on 40 years old and were never designed to be stealthy. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3061.62s)]
*  Until they are replaced by the F-35, Lieutenant General Jartonsen told us, Norway's Air Force [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3066.7s)]
*  will be no match for Russia's modern air defenses. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3072.3s)]
*  Meaning today, if we had a conflict, we would not be able to fly in the northernmost part [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3076.3s)]
*  of Norway. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3084.14s)]
*  So your Air Force today couldn't operate in the very high north? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3085.5s)]
*  No, not in a serious crisis. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3090.5s)]
*  Last fall, NATO practiced what it would do in a serious crisis, bringing in 50,000 troops, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGg6wGHh8w&t=3096.5s)]
